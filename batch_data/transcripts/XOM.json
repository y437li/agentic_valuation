Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir. David Rosenthal : Good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is Exxon Mobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the first quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two. Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth continued at a modest pace in the fourth quarter, with mixed performance across the regions. The U.S. economy grew moderately despite the adverse effects of severe winter weather conditions. China\u2019s growth rate has flattened while the economies of Europe and Japan improved modestly. Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased narrowing the discount to Brent as the global marker decreased in the quarter. Western Canadian select prices increased significantly. North America natural gas prices were also significantly higher. Global industry refining margins were essentially flat while chemical commodity product margins were stronger during the quarter. Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil\u2019s first quarter earnings were $9.1 billion or $2.10 per share. The corporation distributed $5.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion in the quarter. CapEx was $8.4 billion. Cash flow from operation and asset sale was $16.2 billion including proceeds associated with asset sales of $1.1 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $5.8 billion and debt was $21.4 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on first quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter cash increased by $900 million from $4.9 billion to $5.8 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $16.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included additions to property, plant and equipment of $7.3 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.7 billion. Additional financing and investing activities decreased cash by $2.3 billion including a reduction in debt of just over $1 billion. Yesterday the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.69 per share a 9.5% increase from last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the second quarter of 2014. Moving on to slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil\u2019s first quarter earnings of $9.1 billion decreased by $400 million from the first quarter of 2013. Lower downstream chemical earnings as well as higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher upstream earnings. In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 7 earnings increased by $750 million as higher upstream and chemical earnings were partly offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter. Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 8. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $7.8 billion, an increase of $746 million versus the first quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings by $410 million primarily driven by higher U.S natural gas realizations. On a worldwide basis natural gas realizations increased $0.31 per 1,000 cubic feet while crude oil realizations decreased by $4.09 per barrel. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by a net $20 million. This included a favorable liquids mix effect of about $300 million reflecting increased volumes in Canada, Russia and West Africa as well as the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. A positive liquids effect was mostly offset by a lower natural gas volume primarily due to warmer weather in Europe. All other items increased earnings by $320 million mainly due to gains related asset sales. Moving to slide 9. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry oil equivalent production decreased by 2.9% compared to the first quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 73,000 barrels per day, or 3.3%. As the ramp-up at Kearl and lower downtime in several countries more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments and decline. Natural gas production was down 1.2 billion cubic feet per day primarily due to lower weather related demand in Europe. Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 10. Upstream earnings increased to $1 billion versus the fourth quarter. Realizations had a positive impact of $540 million as worldwide natural gas realizations increased $0.84 per thousand cubic feet and crude realizations were essentially flat. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $650 million, this included a substantial positive liquids mix effect associated with increased volumes in Qatar, Kearl and West Africa as well as a net over lift and including the minimal financial impact related to the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry. The positive volume earnings factor also reflects higher natural gas volumes in Qatar. All other items had a negative impact of $190 million. Lower gains related to asset management activities were partially offset by lower operating cost. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $21.35 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Unit profitability increased to $3.40 from the fourth quarter reflecting the benefits of our broad diverse portfolio including leverage to North American natural gas, our strong LNG portfolio and the strategic choices we have made on production volumes to improve unit profitability. Moving to slide 11, excluding the impact of Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry volumes were up 45,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or about 1% sequentially. Liquids production was up 23,000 barrels per day, or 1%. Lower downtime increased production from West Africa projects higher liquids volumes in Qatar and ramp-up at Kearl more than offset price and spend impacts, divestments and decline. Natural gas volumes were up 129 million cubic feet per day reflecting higher volumes in Qatar partly offset by lower production in the United States and Europe. Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 12. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $813 million, down $732 million from the first quarter of 2013 mainly due to lower refining margins across all regions. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $80 million offset by other items for a net $70 million. Turning to slide 13, sequentially first quarter downstream earnings decreased by $103 million primarily due to unfavorable volume and mix effects reflecting higher U.S. refining maintenance activities. Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 14. First quarter chemical earnings were just over a $1 billion, down $90 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to lower margins. Positive volume and mix effects were offset by other items. Moving to slide 15, sequentially chemical earnings increased by a $137 million, primarily due to higher commodity product margins and lower expenses. Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. As we discussed in our March Analyst Meeting we are starting up a number of major projects that will deliver profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling significant progress on several of these projects. At PNG we continue to achieve milestones that will results in the first LNG cargo [to be unloaded] ahead of schedule. We have completed the onshore and offshore sections of the pipeline which transports natural gas from the Hides gas conditioning plant up in the mountains to the LNG plant near Port Moresby. The first LNG train is now operational and the second train is mechanically complete with final commissioning underway. Over recent weeks we started holding the first gas from Hides and in the past few days initiated LNG production. And we produced the first condensate and liquid recovered through the liquefaction process. We expect the first LNG cargo deliver in the coming weeks. These are exciting milestones for the PNG LNG project and a great achievement for our project partners, contractors and the people of Papua New Guinea. As we mentioned in our Analyst Meeting we had overcome a number of challenges during the construction phase such as very steep slopes, flooding and lack of infrastructure. Despite these challenges we are starting up several miles ahead of plan and delivering a project with one of the lowest cost per MTA relative to other LNG projects being built and in close proximity to the growing Asian market. This is also an excellent example of how ExxonMobil creates value through our leading project execution capabilities. In Malaysia we have started our production into the Damar gas field from the first two of a total 16 wells. The Damar field has a projected capacity of 200 million cubic feet of gas per day and follows the Telok gas development which began production in 2013. These projects provide additional gas supplies to help meet Malaysia\u2019s power and industrial needs, promote growth of the country\u2019s natural gas industry and drive profitable volume growth for Exxon Mobil. The Hibernia Southern expansion in Canada a project that will deliver a 170 million barrels of oil is progressing per plan and is now nearing completion. Installation of subsea infrastructure for the water injection facility has now been completed. Three of five platform production wells have been drilled and top side modifications to the Hibernia gravity based structure platform are 97% completed. Start-up is expected later this quarter. At our Arkutun-Dagi in Russia we are commissioning the last few top side system at the fabrication yard. The platform drilling rig will be tested over the coming weeks. Before the 42,000 tonne topside structure is loaded out later this summer. The topside will then be floated over the gravity based structure already installed offshore Sakhalin Island. Drilling will then start and first production is expected later this year. The Banyu Urip project in Indonesia is now 87% complete. The project will deliver 450 million barrels of oil through an onshore central processing facility with a 165,000 barrels per day of production capacity. Pipe rack construction is complete, equipment installation at the central processing facility is progressing and the onshore and offshore pipelines are installed. Conversion of the floating storage and offloading vessel is nearing completion with major equipment installed and commissioning ongoing. Two rigs are operational and the first 20 wells have been drilled. Start-up is expected around year end. The Kearl expansion project in Canada remains slightly ahead of plan and is now more than 80% complete. We continue to ramp-up production from the Kearl initial development with 66,000 barrels per day produced during the first quarter up from 47,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of last year. Facility uptime performance is improving and we are achieving many days with production above 100,000 barrels per day. Turning now to slide 17, for an update on our North American activities. We continue our commitment to deliver profitable volume growth as underscored by our efforts to increase high margins liquids production in the Permian. We had eight operated rigs running in the Permian in the first quarter and recently picked up two more in early April to continue to ramp-up drilling activity. Our current net production in the Permian is over 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Through an agreement with Endeavor Energy Resources, XTO will gain substantial operating equity in approximately 34,000 gross acres in the prolific liquids rich Wolfcamp formation. The presence of multiple stacked pay zones creates a potential for capital efficient horizontal development and the proximity to XTO\u2019s ongoing Wolfcamp operations will offer operating cost efficiencies. The agreement increases XTO\u2019s holdings in the Permian basin to just over 1.5 million net acres, enhancing the company\u2019s significant presence in one of the major growth areas for onshore liquids production in the United States. Also during the quarter we signed an agreement with American Energy-Utica or AEU that will enable XTO to optimize funding of development cost in the Utica. As part of the agreement XTO will continue to operate in a core area of approximately 55,000 net acres in this emerging play and AEU will fund near-term development cost to earn acreage. This transaction is an example of an innovative solution to develop our extensive natural gas resources in United States in a capital efficient manner. Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities, we are currently drilling a number of wildcat prospects from our deep and diverse opportunity portfolio, primarily concentrated in established areas. Some of this activity, includes the deepwater prospects Mica Deep in the Gulf of Mexico and the Cominhos prospect in Angola Block 32. We also continue exploration drilling in the prolific Block 2 offshore Tanzania were somewhere between 17 and 20 TCF of gas in place has already been discovered. And a recent drill stem test on the Zafrani 2 well confirmed good reservoir quality and good connectivity in both of the reservoirs tested. Drilling operations are also currently underway on two blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Also preparations are underway for near-term drilling that includes the [Inaudible]prospect in the Kara Sea, the broad gaining prospect in the Faroe Islands, follow up drilling to the successful Domino well in the Romanian Black Sea, the [Inaudible]well in Gabon and additional drilling prospects in Tanzania. Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our chemical business. During the quarter we achieved notable investment milestones to grow high value product sales. For example we processed synthetic base stock investments to meet global demand growth for high performance lubricant applications. We commissioned a new 50,000 tons per year manufacturing facility in our Baytown, Texas complex and construction of our expansion project in Baton Rouge, Louisiana continued during the quarter with start-up anticipated late this year. Both projects leverage Exxon Mobil\u2019s technology leadership to meet the industry\u2019s growing demand for advanced synthetic basestocks and improved finished lubricant performance. We also recently improved a world scale grassroots specialty polymers project in Singapore to produce halobutyl rubber to support the growing tire market in the region. In premium resins for adhesive applications such as packaging, wood working and non-molding fabrics. The project builds on the feedstock advantage and integration benefits of the recent steam cracking expansion and will allow us to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. Construction will begin this year and start-up is planned for 2017. In conclusion in the first quarter we earned $9.1 billion, increased upstream unit profitability to $21.35 per barrel, generated $16.2 billion in cash flow from operations and assets sales, invested $8.4 billion in the business and distributed $5.7 billion to our shareholders. ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial and operating performance demonstrates progress in delivering profitable growth and achieving our business objectives outlined during our Analyst Meeting in March. We improved our production mix and increased upstream unit profitability. We are committed to maintaining our capital spending discipline and generating strong operating cash flow to deliver robust shareholder distributions and create long-term shareholder value. That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you Mr. Rosenthal. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. (Operator Instructions). We request that you limit your number of questions to two so that as many may have the opportunity to participate as possible. (Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Doug Terreson with ISI Group. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group : Good morning David. David Rosenthal : Good morning Doug. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group : I have a couple of questions on international E&P. First both profitability end margins were very strong and pretty much it has been in several quarters even if you normalized for the exploration in Abu Dhabi. So my question is whether there is any additional color on the positive liquid mix effects that you talked about a minute ago and whether or not there were any positive effects on the gas side that might have contributed to that result? David Rosenthal : Yeah sure, let me take a look at the upstream earnings, we can look quarter versus quarter where I mentioned although we had a net impact of only $20 million we did have a significant impact on liquids that was about $290 million and gas was a negative $270 million on that. When you look at the production in the first quarter we saw some nice increases in Canada, Southern Russia, West Africa much lower downtime little more in the North Sea and those were benefits to us. And the biggest decline in production was the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry which carried a little earnings effect. If you would look at that same effect sequentially where we noted we had $650 million volume mix impact, liquids was about $400 million of that and gas was about $250 million. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group : Okay. David Rosenthal : So as we look at going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter similar on the liquid side we saw some increases in Qatar, increases in West Africa as well Canada with a ramp up of Kearl and then it offset with the decline in Abu Dhabi. On the gas side we also saw a nice positive mix effect volumes for example in Qatar were up and volumes in Europe which was mainly the lower margin volumes out of the Netherlands were down because of the lower demand due to the normal weather. So in both liquids and in gas sequentially we did see a nice uplift in earnings from the positive mix effect. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group : Okay. And so on your last comment about European natural gas most of that or all of that decline was related to weather is that the way to think about it? David Rosenthal : Yeah. The way to think about is it was all demand driven due to weather with the bulk of it again coming out of the Netherlands where the margins are a little lower than they are than on the rest of our European sales. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI Group : Great. Thanks a lot David. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : And from [Singular] Research we\u2019ll hear from Paul (Inaudible). Unidentified Analyst : Hi David. David Rosenthal : Hey good morning Paul how are you? Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. David can I just ask you about your CapEx and your volumes in the former case there is an enormous step down in your CapEx almost 30% which takes you well below the run rate for the year that you indicated at the Analyst Meeting is around $40 billion. Is there a reason to believe that we\u2019re coming in lower on CapEx for the year or is this \u2013 Q1 with your catch up later and therefore you would stick with the 40 or could we see some downside to that? And if I could follow up on the volumes David the guidance at the Meeting has been flat to \u201814 over \u201813 aligned for all the adjustments that needed to be made, again your Q1 numbers are actually tracking below that. Can we expect a catch up back to flat later in the year. And final \u2013 final part if you could just address the cash account and where that sat within your volume forecast both for this year and longer-term? Thanks. David Rosenthal : Okay, sure Paul. Let me hit CapEx first. Yeah we did come in at $8.4 billion that was down little over $3 billion from the first quarter last year. That was mainly due to the absence of the Celtic acquisition in Canada, so if you take that out from last year\u2019s results we\u2019d be pretty much flat maybe down just a little bit. As we look out across the year the first quarter is usually lower than the rest of the quarters, we tend to ramp up across the year with a little extra in the back half. So I would say as we look at where we are today and looking out over the rest of the year the number we gave you in the Analyst Meeting is probably still a good one. I don\u2019t have an update, you know what I will say though is when we look at the first quarter CapEx it came in just about right on what we had expected. So, so far this year things are going according to plan on CapEx. On the volumes guidance we said overall we will be flat at about 4.0 million oil equivalent barrels per day year-to-year ex-Abu Dhabi about a 2% increase in liquids, about a 2% decrease in gas. As we look at the first quarter and then across the rest of the year those numbers still look good to us. We have got some additional ramp up expected at Kearl across the year. We do expect some of these other projects I mentioned come on Papua New Guinea being one of those. So we look at the first quarter it looks real strong and certainly increases our \u2013 maintains our confidence in meeting that full year projection we shared with you in the Analyst Meeting. I think the other thing that\u2019s noteworthy when I talked about a little bit on the last question is we are seeing the impacts we are expecting on the volume mix as we reduced our exposure to some lower margin barrels and we are able to increase production in some of our higher margin areas both on the liquids and gas side. And so that\u2019s kind of coming in as we are expecting and we talked about a little bit at the Analyst Meeting. In terms of Kashagan in the forecast for \u201814 we did not have any volumes in our outlook that we showed you in March for Kashagan for 2014. Unidentified Analyst : That\u2019s very helpful, David and then a quick follow-up. Your product sales were up 11% year-over-year quarter-to-quarter in the past \u2013 recent past there has been a number heavily affected by asset mix. Could you just address the scale of that jump I mean 11% growth obviously on a company of your size looks like enormously strong oil demand globally, any thoughts? Thanks David Rosenthal : Well. Let me just clarify the question are you saying product sales or are you talking about our downstream sales or? Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, I should say to use your language exactly the petroleum product sales, if I look worldwide they are up 5.8 million barrels a day up from a year ago level of 5.7? David Rosenthal : Yeah, we are up a little bit we have seen worldwide, we actually had some higher demand in the US actually some pretty good demand growth there. We have seen some growth in diesel as well with exports and actually some growth in Europe. So those are the two main areas but a nice quarter for us operationally as well. Unidentified Analyst : Well I guess my question was just \u2013 which is a comparable number year-over-year or whether there was any asset mix in that so whether we could just look? David Rosenthal : No, that\u2019s pretty comparable. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Okay, thanks very much. David Rosenthal : Yeah. I am Sorry I didn\u2019t understand the question. All right. Thank you. Operator : And next we will hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, David. David Rosenthal : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : David I wonder if I could follow-up on the other Doug\u2019s question on margins, your unit margin captures something you have told about periodically in this quarter they had a fairly nice rebound. I am just wondering if you can walk us through any particular reasons behind that and was it just a great operating quarter, how sustainable could this be. And as I can follow-on to that you are going to have about a 1 million barrels a day of new production by your forecast between \u2013 obviously that\u2019s a fairly good churn in the portfolio. I am wondering if you could kind of just qualitatively or quantitatively whichever you can do walk through the delta you see in cash margins for the newer projects relative to the existing portfolio, please? David Rosenthal : Sure. Let\u2019s start up with the margin and the margin capture. In addition to some of the volume mix items I mentioned. You actually have some fairly significant mix impacts on the realization side which kind of get massed by some of the markers. So for example if you look this quarter versus the same quarter last year WTI is up over 4 bucks, rents down over $4 but Western Canada Select it was up $9 a barrel as a marker for the Canadian crude. So if you think about where we are exposed to Brent overseas a number of production, but including the Abu Dhabi barrels would have some tie to that. Whereas in the US a lot of our production particularly in the Permian would be closer to a WTI spot price and then of course all of our volumes in Canada. So it\u2019s not just Kearl you are talking about Cold Lake and our other production up there. So, think about it as the volumes that went up were attracting the higher margin or the higher price marker crudes. The volumes that declined happened to be the ones that were Brent based and again a big change in those prices did not have much of an earnings impact. So you see a nice change on both the volume mix side as well as on the price side. So if kind of back to again and we have been talking about in the last couple of Analyst Meeting\u2019s, growing the liquids and liquids linked volumes, LNG prices were also very attractive in the quarter and we were able to capture those by having some increased volumes in Qatar. So I\u2019d say kind of on a go-forward basis this is probably more typical than what we have seen in the past again given from the mix changes I mentioned. If we look at the barrels that we are going to be adding on equivalent basis going forward I wouldn\u2019t give any specific cash margins on those barrels but if you recall back at the Analyst Meeting some of the discussion I think Mark Albers provided in his comments we did talk about that the volumes coming online were going to be generally accretive to our average unit margin and given the fiscal regimes we would be in those projects also accretive to earnings. So I think again as we go forward over the next year or two when we start up these projects we expect to deliver the profitable growth that we talked about in the analyst meeting and we certainly look forward to these projects coming online over the next three years. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thanks. A very quick follow-up, could you give the absolute asset sale gain in the quarter versus the housekeeping point and I will leave it there? David Rosenthal : Yeah, sure if you look at on an earnings basis the absolute gain on asset sales in total was just over $400 million and that was all in the upstream. So the absolute, I just gave you the numbers here for that I know there is going to be interest in the upstream the absolute value of the asset sales on earnings was about $400 million in the first quarter of this year, that compared was lower than and compared to about $800 million in the fourth quarter of last year and we didn\u2019t have any asset sales in the first quarter. So you got about a 400 positive delta quarter-over-quarter and almost 400 delta sequentially on the negative side. The other thing I will mention to kind of put the first quarter asset sales into perspective on an absolute basis I mentioned we have 400 million in positive. We had about 200 million of negative tax items and other reserves. So if you kind of think about outside the normal operations of the business we probably had a net absolute value in the upstream of about $200 million. Doug Leggate \u2013 Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot David. Operator : And from Jefferies we will hear from Jason (Inaudible). Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. Hello David. David Rosenthal : Hey, hello Jason. Unidentified Analyst : David I wanted to ask about the PNG LNG projects and congratulations to Exxon for bringing the project on ahead of schedule that something that hasn\u2019t been achieved in that business in quite a while. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : Wanted to ask about the pace of ramp up David, you have made reference to first commercial cargos by the end of the quarter from the first train and start-up production from the second train in several weeks. Would you expect that you could potentially be achieving full production by year-end from both trains from that project? David Rosenthal : It\u2019s first of all thanks for the comments on the project start-up, the team is very proud of. As I mentioned bringing that in early and it looks like certainly within the budget that we had talked about and so we do look for ahead of planned production and cargo deliveries. If we look out towards the end of the year we will certainly be ramping up both the first train and the second train and assuming all that continues to go well, we would expect to see these things ramp up pretty good across the coming months. So it\u2019s a little early for me to give you a definitive answer. But I would say it\u2019s likely that by the time we get to the end of the year we are going to be running at some pretty good operating rates. Unidentified Analyst : Okay great. And if I could ask you second one David, it\u2019s obviously pretty early days just in terms of sanctions on Russia. But have you had any effects on your ability to invest in the multiple areas where you participate with Rosneft as a partner in Russia? David Rosenthal : With regards to Russia off-course we will comply with all sanctions, but I can tell you on the latter part of your question all of the activities that we had originally planned for this year are underway and proceeding as planned. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you David. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll here from Asit Sen with Cowen & Company. Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company: Thanks, good morning David. David Rosenthal : Good morning, Asit. How are you? Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company: Good, thanks. So on PNG LNG as we get closer to the start I was wondering if you could provide some early thoughts on some incremental operational items? First wondering if you could talk about the condensate ratio, second any thoughts on train three expansion potential and finally any thoughts on LNG contract and strategy related to the pricing slope and or your spot exposure? David Rosenthal : Sure. On the condensate ratio I really couldn\u2019t give you a specific number for the expectation there, obviously it\u2019s a very attractive stream. When we look at Train3 we are still evaluating a number of opportunities to expand the plant some of those relate to our own exploration success and other opportunities that we have on our own operated acreage as well as potential other sources of additional gas. So that planning and looking and analyzing and discussing that process is ongoing don\u2019t have a definitive outcome for you. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks if you look at the plan as it sits today the cost per MTA in today\u2019s market is very competitive and off-course any additional capacity we take advantage of the existing infrastructure and even be more attractive so we are certainly looking at that. If you look at our contracting strategy we entered into long-term oil index price contracts about 95% of the production is already sold under those contracts, customers being in Japan, China and Taiwan. So those contracts are locked up and then you\u2019ll have of course a little bit left over for some spot sales. Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen & Company: Thanks very helpful. David Rosenthal : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And from Wells Fargo we got Roger Read. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Yeah, thanks. Good morning. David Rosenthal : Hey, Roger. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Just to come back to the margin discussion and maybe as a better way to understand some of the moving parts going forward. I gather the expansion of liquids or shrinking of the gas and what that should mean from margins as well as the edition of the LNG barrels but I was wondering underlying cost. Can you give us any kind of view of what\u2019s going on there? I mean are we dealing with cost are going to go up but your margins go up faster, cost should hold flat while margins should improve from mix in price maybe a little more detail on that if you could? David Rosenthal : You know as we look at the overall profitability as you mentioned margins are doing better with the mix that we talked about on both the oil and the gas side. In terms of OpEx we are not seeing any significant upward pressure across the portfolio. If you look at that on an absolute basis off-course OpEx is up with startup of some of our big projects Kearl would be a good example on that as we progress from the startup phase last year and to lining up production and ramping up this year you get some benefit of that. We did see some lower exploration expense in the first quarter this year as you recall in last year in the second half we booked some fairly heavy exploration expense mainly attributed to our business in Russia and that was a little lower this quarter but as expected. So I\u2019d say overall when you think about the margin capture and the profit capture again it\u2019s the mix that we\u2019ve talked about in particular as we ramp up these projects across the quarter. I think the other thing I might add is on the unconventional side we continue to make good progress driving cost down in the areas that we are operating as we\u2019ve talked about before the combination of ExxonMobil\u2019s technology and XTO\u2019s operating experience. We are really starting to see the leverage we get by combining those particularly as we continue to acquire attractive acreage as I mentioned in the Permian would be a good example of that. So across that portfolio that trend continues to be positive in terms of reducing cost and improving capital efficiency. So that part of the business is also doing well. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay, great, thanks. And then a follow-up question. Recent headlines indicated Argentina is going to actually be importing some crude obviously you are a major mover and shaker in Vaca Muerta shale. I was wondering have you seen any indications from the Argentinean government that they are willing to be I don\u2019t know a good term flexible in terms of helping to accelerate activity down there? David Rosenthal : I\u2019ll take the last part of your question first. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the government about fiscal terms and stability and I don\u2019t have anything definitive to report on that but those discussions are ongoing. We have seen some positive signals out of the government recently in terms of improving export and import conditions and what we are doing there. These are certainly positive steps that could lead to an attractive business environment. But it\u2019s all part of progressing the programs and determining commerciality. Obviously there is a huge potential resource in Argentina called the Vaca Muerta. We continue to have an active program there I think we\u2019ve got a total of six wells down. We\u2019ve been drilling vertical wells in prior to this year, we are starting to drill our first operated horizontal wells. First one is down and second one is drilling and we\u2019ll be getting the third one down shortly. Again without being specific, I can tell you that the data so far from our drilling and delineation is encouraging but it\u2019s still early days to determine actual commerciality. But if you get the combination of good fiscal terms of stability and good resource development that generally leads to a commercial resource development for you. So we continue to actively pursue that but again for us it\u2019s a very large resource, we got in at a very low entry cost and very low commitment. And so that allows us to really go about this in a disciplined manner and really utilize some of the expertise XTO has to help us explore and delineate the resource without having to spend a whole lot of money upfront. So again we are encouraged and that piece of the business is moving along very well. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Great, thank you. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Faisal Khan with Citi. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi: Hey, good morning it\u2019s Faizal from Citi. David Rosenthal : Good morning, Faizal. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi: Thanks, David. If you could \u2013 you talked a little bit about sort of the increase in profitability in the upstream business, you also discussed LNG sort of prices. Can you remind us how much of your total LNG volumes are exposed to the spot market? David Rosenthal : You know I don\u2019t have a total global number on that. I think probably what would be more indicative is if you look at \u2013 if you take the U.S. aside of course and you look at our total LNG volumes. Most of those are going at oil index prices but the rest of them by and large are going into the Asia Pacific rim. And so the spot prices there are fairly close to the oil index prices and so you are getting a nice benefit there. As well the occasional cargo that goes into Europe goes into the spot price but those are attractive as well. So regardless of how the cargo is going either directly or indirectly \u2013 most of them or probably all of it about 5% are either oil indexed or getting the equivalent type prices. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay. I guess I was just trying to understand the commentary given that oil prices haven\u2019t moved all that much sequentially quarter to quarter but it sounded like that was a typically strong point for you in the quarter. David Rosenthal : Thank you. It was and a lot of it is the mix on where these cargo\u2019s get delivered and whether they are going to Europe or they are going to the Asia Pacific rim or whether you have a little higher proportion going into your fixed contracts versus your spot. So we did see a little uplift on those prices as you know not all those contracts are the same in terms of how they look back and what the formula is. But if we look across for example our LNG realizations out of Qatar and you are just looking quarter-on-quarter this year to last year we were up a little over a $1 a KCF. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay. David Rosenthal : So, again a nice piece of business. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi: Yeah. And thanks I appreciate that detail. And then just back to Russia for a second I believe you guys have some sort of asset swap sort of arrangement with Rosneft that sort of protects you in case some of the investments get stranded in Russia. Can you just walk us through a little bit of that in case there are sanctions as there are [Inaudible]here in the U.S with the sort of assets that Rosneft has swapped into with you and that sort [Inaudible]you guys put together? David Rosenthal : Yeah. I really can\u2019t comment on the terms and conditions of those pieces of business other than yeah we have the projects that we have in Russia and they farmed into some of our properties on a normal farming basis just like anybody else would. But any discussion of contractual details or commercial arrangements really couldn\u2019t comment on. Faisal Khan \u2013 Citi: Okay. Got it. Thanks David. I appreciate the time. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : And from Barclays we\u2019ll hear from Paul Cheng. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Hey guys. Good morning. David Rosenthal : Hi Paul. How are you doing? Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Hi, very good. Dave, two quick questions. One you told about the over \u2013 benefit in the first quarter. Can you give us or quantify what\u2019s the volume and also the dollar value and also at the end of the first quarter whether from an inventory standpoint you are roughly [Inaudible] or underneath? David Rosenthal : Sure. If you are looking in the first quarter relative to the first quarter last year. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Can we look at relative to the \u2013 to your production actually? David Rosenthal : Sure. I mean we are about 15 kbd over lifted in the quarter, yeah on an absolute basis were about 15 kbd over lifted and I would estimate that to be about worth about a $100 million. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Okay. And that at the end of the first quarter are you [Inaudible] balance at this point? David Rosenthal : Yeah. If we look at where we are just at the end of the first quarter I think we are over lifted just a little bit so we are not completely in balance but we are fairly close. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Okay. Second question on Permian right now you are running at 10 rigs. Is there any color or insight you can provide on what this [Inaudible]going to [Inaudible]look like over the next two or three years. You just add two should we assume that you will continue to ramp up the program there. And also whether you can tell us the $90,000 barrel per day production, what\u2019s the mix between light oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas? David Rosenthal : Yeah. Let me start with the first part. We are of course ramping up activity in the Permian. We are doing it like we always do in a very disciplined approach you don\u2019t want to get too far out in front your headlight. So we have been building that rig count over the first last few quarters I did mention the additional acreage that we picked up in a very attractive area in the Wolfcamp. So as we move on I would expect the trajectory to be the same but I don\u2019t have any specific count for you. Again in a lot of these areas we are still delineating, we are still appraising, we are still experimenting with how we go about drilling and completing wells and that sort of thing. But I think directionally given the quality of the acreage that we have and the results we have had to date I think it would be a reasonable expectation that we would likely grow that rig count over the course of the year I think that will be logical. But again always in a manner that keeps in mind the long term development of these resources and not getting out too far in front and doing something that you regret later. So it\u2019s all about assessing what we\u2019ve got, we are very, very pleased with our acreage and then ramping up that production as is appropriate and leading towards that outlook we gave you in the Analyst Meeting that showed a nice way up between now and 2017 in total North American\u2019s liquid production but the Permian seems to be a big part of that. In terms of the on split on the liquids versus NGLs versus condensates I don\u2019t have that split for you, Paul. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Okay. Thank you. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : And from Credit Suisse we\u2019ll hear from Edward Westlake. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hey yes. Good morning, David. Three very quick tail end questions. People have said and thanks by the way for the helpful color on Asia LNG and well done on the execution of some of the key projects. Some of the people have shouted out a gas marketing benefit in given the cold winter in the U.S, did you guys have any something there that we should think about? David Rosenthal : Well I mean we benefited from the higher gas prices but other than that we certainly don\u2019t do any trading if that\u2019s what you are looking at. So let me if that was the question let me be clear all of our earnings uplift comes from the production and sale of our gas we don\u2019t do any trading. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. Good. And then switching to the international chemicals I mean obviously 4Q was weak and you\u2019ve seen a bit of a comeback in Q1. Maybe just talk a little bit about you shouted out lower other expenses maybe just a bit of shout on what\u2019s happening there. David Rosenthal : Sure. If we just as so we weren\u2019t from the fourth quarter into the first quarter this year we didn\u2019t have some significantly lower maintenance expense you might recall in the fourth quarter. It was pretty high, we had some turnaround activity going on in Singapore and that\u2019s all behind us and that\u2019s the biggest driver in that other bucket. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : So it\u2019s not a sort of fee change in demand that you see in the chemical chain? David Rosenthal : I wouldn\u2019t say a fee change but I would say that we are seeing some encouraging signs the integrated chemical chain or seeing some pickup in demand polyethylene sales have been good and we continue to see some nice demand pickup there. We did also see some pickup which was seasonal between the fourth quarter and the first quarter in our specialties business. But on the other hand aromatics demand is weak strictly in this, so there are some offsets. But I think generally speaking we have seen a little better demand, we have been able to sell the increased production out of Singapore so that part of the business is going well. So I think as you kind of go from fourth quarter to first quarter in the chemical business, lower maintenance as we move into the \u2013 from the first quarter to the second quarter as you are probably aware we are heading under a higher maintenance period. The chem plant for example came down in early April and is down for a couple of months\u2019 turnaround, so we will see that impact. But a really nice first quarter operations on the chemical side I think our capacity utilization particularly in North America where of course we get a nice margin benefit I think we were running about 2% or 3% on a capacity utilization better than industry. So that\u2019s not only good in total but on the margin those couple percent really, really ring the cash register for you on those sales. So good quarter for us in the chemical business. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : And just on the cash flow statement working capital contribution in the quarter? David Rosenthal : Our working capital contributions I recall just under $2 billion about $1.8 billion and that was just a change in payables. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Right. David Rosenthal : I think not a real big effect if you think about total cash flows a number less than $2 billion in the quarter but it was payables driven. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : And then one bigger picture question. They always talk about Shell but I mean obviously you\u2019ve been doing a lot of offshore exploration as well. When do you think you will get to the point where you can sort of update us in terms of actually getting after to sort of developing some of these deep water fields that you\u2019ve got in the portfolio? David Rosenthal : Yeah. I think as-soon-as we have a little better indication exactly on what we\u2019ve got in some of these areas, one that I can mention is Tanzania where we have had significant success and our planning is underway as we speak not only with our partner in Block 2 Statoil but also with BG and Ophir broadly across Tanzania. So we are working at evaluating potential sites for an LNG facility and we have made a recommendation to the government and studies are progressing you know to really determine what would be the optimum development plan for our block and across that area. So I would say all of that is progressing as you would expect for a resource of that size. But I can\u2019t give you a definitive development plan or timing yet. Julie is another deepwater project that\u2019s well underway and we\u2019ll start drilling there this year. We\u2019ve got more drilling to do in Romania where we had a very nice successful initial well there. So a lot going in some very attractive areas, but probably still just a little early to be talking definitive development plans or startups or FIDs or that sort of things. Edward Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : And next from Morgan Stanley we\u2019ll hear from Evan Calio. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yes, good afternoon David. More housekeeping from me, exploration expenses much lower in the quarter like 338 versus normal. Is that just timing event or is there any exploration spend trending over there. David Rosenthal : I wouldn\u2019t say there is any lower trend, it\u2019s really particularly if you look quarter-on-quarter it was really just timing of expenditure, particularly in Russia and some other areas, but the program remains on track, on schedule. And I think you\u2019ll probably see a little more normalized kind a trend as we go out into the year. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. On the asset again and you gave just color earlier, the included income. Was that in international upstream gaining more? David Rosenthal : That was in international upstream. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Got it. And maybe just lastly from me with cash builds equaling asset sales for you in the quarter, what was the consideration to for holding the buyback flat sequentially. And then how do you what do you need to see you think to raise it. Thank you. David Rosenthal : Yes I wouldn\u2019t. No change in our strategy with regard to shareholder distributions in general. You saw we got a nice 9.5% bump in the dividend this quarter continuing a nice trend that you\u2019ve seen the last few years. So growing that dividend and making sure it\u2019s reliable and consistent continues to be at the top of the list for shareholder distribution. The buyback continues to be [out]. But the cash we have and although we do look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis, we are always thinking into account cash flow projections and business and that\u2019s sort of thing. So again on a company our size, plus or minus the $1 billion not a big number. I do think that it\u2019s noteworthy if you look at the free cash flow for example in the quarter particularly relative to the last few quarters, we did generate a total of $16 billion, put a bunch of that into the business funded the both the dividend and the buyback, and still had $2 billion over half we paid down debt and half we increased cash. So again if you\u2019re looking kind a sequentially across the last few quarters, very strong quarter in cash flow consistent with the strong quarter in earnings. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Got it. Thank you. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : And from Raymond James we\u2019ll go Pavel Molchanov. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : Thanks for taking the question. One more on the cash allocation, by my math this will the first quarter that your dividend payout $[40] billion equals your share buyback. Is that deliberate and do you see the Q lines kind a continuing to cross that line? David Rosenthal : I would say that was a coincidence. It\u2019s not a there is not deliberate effort to match those out or more change any ratios to that\u2019s sort. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. And this maybe most relevant for your German acreage, but in the context of the Ukrainian crisis and lot of rhetoric in Europe about ramping up shale development, any sense that permitting in Germany or elsewhere in Europe is starting to open up? David Rosenthal : No, I don\u2019t have any indication of that. There is a lot of discussion going on as you\u2019re all aware but nothing definitive nothing different than what\u2019s been going on. As you know we have a very attractive acreage position in Germany and we\u2019ve been in discussions with the regulators for a while on the potential of that resource and those in fact the discussions are going but nothing is specific to report on today. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thank you guys. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : We have one question left in the queue and that will come from Peter [Hudson] with RBC. Unidentified Analyst : Good afternoon. Just two quick follow ups. Kashagan you said no volumes is expect, kind of expected anyway in 2014. But I wonder whether you could say what do you had in your plans for 2016 and what those still are? And also on the upside you are talking about Tanzania. Is taken quite some time since the recommendation has gone in about the location of the plant facility. But still nothing is come out. Do we have a timing of when we might get that as the next catalyst in that area? And then finally, the downstream, you stress the words on the international downstream that was a least quite a lower than the number of people had expected, profitability levels back to the sort of early 2009. One of your competitors took a big impairment on the refining assets in Asia and are being very clear about the weakness, structural weakness in that market. Is there something that you\u2019re seeing such as that and expect to continue out into the medium and long-term as well. Thank you. David Rosenthal : Let me take those in order here. In Kashagan as I mentioned in the outlook, we showed in March we did not a value for 2014. We did have some volumes in 2015. I don\u2019t want to give a specific number here today, but we did have assumed some production volume in 2015. In Tanzania, we don\u2019t have any final determination on the site, but I will tell you the discussions are ongoing and going well. Nothing out of the ordinary and the plans for that are progressing at an appropriate pace. So I think I will stop there. So we look at the downstream on the international side, yes you did see some weak earnings there overall. We had a positive impact in Canada, if you saw the IOL results out this morning, very nice business there. We\u2019re running obviously vantage crews into this refinery. And that keeps the business just going well. Outside of Canada, the rest, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pac were weak. The biggest driver there is the margin. You had some surplus refining capacity come online in that area of the world last couple of years. And the advance are a little weak so you got some capacity expansion and excess of demand growth. We do see some weakness there. We are doing a number of things to improve our profitability there and improve our competitiveness. We\u2019ve been spending sometime on logistics and expanding feedstock flexibility, working to increase exposure to high value product yields and less exposure to lower margin products, continuing to work on operating expense and maximizing the logistics benefits we get both from the location of our refineries particularly in Europe, but also that integration, full integration with the chemical business and the lose business which is doing quite well. So I think if you look at that business it\u2019s weak it\u2019s been weak for a little while. These are always cyclical business both in Europe and in the US and in the Asia-Pacific rim. So you wouldn\u2019t want to take current results and draw a long-term trend. We\u2019re doing what we can, controlling what we can control. And really it\u2019s about making sure your refineries and your plans for that matter in any region are the most competitive in that region. And that\u2019s what benefits you over the long term. When you talk about a potential impairment, we follow US GAAP with regard to impairment, and we look at that as appropriate, but from our perspective and this preference from company to follow IFRS accounting rules when we look at the US GAAP accounting we don\u2019t see any exposure to that in that part of the world. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : Great, thank you. David Rosenthal : Yes one of the things you might recall just quickly when you look across both the downstream and the chemical segment bear in mind the significant advantage we have on an ROCE basis to the rest of the industry. So when you look at the denominator when you look at the capital employed in our business both on the chemical side and on the downstream side, our capital employed tends to be in order of magnitude lower than the others. So that helps generate the ROCEs but also gives you feel for how much capital is on the book. And then the other thing of course we benefit from is the level integration we have. So we even as refining cycle is one way and chemical is on other one you get some offsets and when they\u2019re both on an upswing that\u2019s where you see the benefit of that integration, so. Across the business we continue to do well to generate the highest returns in the business and just don\u2019t have any long-term concerns. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thanks very much. David Rosenthal : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And Mr. Rosenthal there are no other questions at this time. David Rosenthal : Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that does concludes today\u2019s presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation.",

Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Exxon Mobil Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir. David S. Rosenthal: Good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the second quarter. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Moving to Slide 3. We provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic growth improved modestly in the second quarter. U.S. economic activity recovered after contracting in the first quarter. China's growth rate strengthened due to increased exports and government stimulus, while Europe's economic recovery remained moderate. Energy markets delivered mixed results. WTI prices increased by more than $4 a barrel, narrowing the discount to Brent, while Western Canadian Select prices also strengthened. U.S. natural gas prices decreased compared to the first quarter. Global industry refining margins strengthened, while strong chemical commodity margins were offset by weaker specialty margins. Turning now to the financial results, as shown on Slide 4. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $8.8 billion or $2.05 per share. The corporation distributed $6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion. CapEx was $9.8 billion in the quarter and $18.2 billion year-to-date, down 17% from the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.8 billion, including proceeds associated with asset sales of $2.6 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash totaled $6.3 billion and debt was $21.8 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on second quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased by about $500 million from $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.7 billion and shareholder distributions of $6 billion. Other financing activities increased cash by $400 million. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $3 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Moving on to Slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings of $8.8 billion increased by $1.9 billion from the second quarter 2013, primarily reflecting gains on asset sales and higher earnings across all business segments. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 7, earnings decreased by $320 million, as lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate and financing expenses were partly offset by higher Upstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million a quarter. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, and starting on Slide 8. Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $7.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion versus the second quarter of 2013. Realizations increased earnings by $580 million, primarily driven by higher liquids realizations. On a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations increased by $4.48 per barrel. Worldwide natural gas realizations decreased $0.39 per thousand cubic feet, as higher U.S. gas prices were offset by lower international realizations. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $200 million due to a net underlift, primarily in West Africa, and lower gas volumes. Excluding the underlift impact, volume/mix was a positive factor of about $50 million, reflecting higher-margin production growth, primarily from North America and Papua New Guinea. All other items increased earnings by $1.2 billion mainly due to gains on asset sales in Hong Kong. Moving to Slide 9. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil-equivalent production decreased by 2.3% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production was up 8,000 barrels per day. Increased U.S. liquids production and [indiscernible] volumes were mostly offset by a scheduled maintenance in Canada and Kazakhstan, base decline and unfavorable entitlement and divestment impacts. Natural gas production was down 604 million cubic feet per day, as lower weather-related demand in Europe and expected fuel decline were partly offset by new production from PNG LNG. Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 10. Upstream earnings increased $98 million versus the first quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $620 million, reflecting expected lower seasonal demand in Europe, scheduled maintenance and underlift impacts primarily in West Africa. All other items had a positive impact of $920 million, primarily driven by net gains on asset sales. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $23.07, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interest volumes. Moving to Slide 11. Excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, volumes were down 288,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day or about 6.9% sequentially. Liquids production was down 77,000 barrels per day mainly due to scheduled maintenance in Canada, Kazakhstan and the North Sea, along with unfavorable entitlement impacts. Increased U.S. liquids production provided a partial offset. Natural gas volumes were down 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe and cutter [ph] Downtime, partly offset by the addition of PNG LNG volumes. Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 12. Downstream earnings for the first quarter were $711 million, up $315 million from the second quarter of 2013. Margins decreased earnings by $330 million, driven by lower non-U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $280 million, reflecting reduced planned maintenance activities. Other items increased earnings by $370 million primarily due to the absence of Dartmouth Refinery conversion costs and lower maintenance expenses. Turning to Slide 13. Sequentially, second quarter Downstream earnings decreased by $102 million primarily due to unfavorable volume/mix effects and higher maintenance activities, partially offset by higher margins. Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results, and starting on Slide 14. Second quarter Chemical earnings were $841 million, up $85 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to favorable volume/mix and ForEx effects. Stronger commodity margins were offset by weaker specialties margins. Moving to Slide 15. Sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased by $206 million primarily due to lower specialty margins and higher planned maintenance activities. Moving now to an update on year-to-date cash flow growth, as shown on Slide 16. Strong free cash flow of $14.8 billion represented an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $29 billion more than covered the $14.2 billion invested in the business and $11.7 billion distributed to shareholders, with remaining cash used for other financing activities and addition to our cash balance. This year-to-date free cash flow growth reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program and a disciplined capital allocation approach. As highlighted in our March Analyst Meeting, we are starting up a number of major projects that will add significant profitable volume growth. Our world-class project execution capabilities are enabling us to make significant progress and achieve key milestones. One of these milestones was the PNG LNG project startup in April, which was months ahead of schedule. We have now ramped up to full production through both LNG trains and are currently producing close to 1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. Through July, we have already loaded 15 cargoes for delivery to customers in Asia. The project was completed below the $19 billion budget announced in 2012 and produces LNG at a unit cost that is one of the lowest in the region. This achievement is a good example of how ExxonMobil creates value through technology applications and leading project execution capabilities. Learnings will be applied to other LNG projects that we plan to progress. In Angola, the CLOV project, of which ExxonMobil owns a 20% interest, started operations in June. Production is now ramping up and expected to reach 160,000 barrels per day. Offshore Sakhalin Island, the top side of the Berkut platform has been installed onto the gravity-based structure at the Arkutun-Dagi field. The operations set a world record for installation of the heaviest integrated topside structure, weighing over 42,000 tons and using the world's largest ocean-going barge to carry and then set the structure. Berkut is now the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia. The facility will start up later this year and will add up to 90,000 barrels per day to Sakhalin-1 oil production. Let me now provide a quick update on Kashagan. The project partners have agreed to work towards a progressive transition from the current venture model to a consolidated joint venture company operating under a single corporate management system, integrating the existing processes and tools from the venture entities. An experienced ExxonMobil executive has been appointed as the Managing Director of the operating company. Regarding the pipeline issues, the current assessment is that both oil and gas pipelines need to be replaced. The North Caspian Operating Company is now developing a full replacement plan. Turning now to Slide 18 for an update on our exploration activities. In Argentina, we drilled and successfully completed 2 ExxonMobil-operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, while the La Invernada X-3 well will be flow-tested during the third quarter. Our active program continues, with additional wells planned to be drilled in the second half of the year. In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made an additional discovery in Block 2. The Piri-1 well discovered gas in a high-quality reservoir, confirming an additional 2 to 3 TCF of gas in place. 6 gas discoveries in Block 2 have been made to date, with total resource in place estimated at 20 TCF. ExxonMobil, Statoil, BG and Ophir completed an evaluation of potential sites for our common onshore LNG plant and made a location recommendation to the government of Tanzania. Drilling operations are also currently underway on 2 blocks in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. At Pirmam, we have successfully drilled to target depth and are preparing to test the well in the third quarter. In Alqosh, we are drilling ahead and anticipate reaching target depth in the third quarter. In Romania, we have spud the Domino-2 well in the Neptun Block in the Black Sea. Data collected from the well will aid in the development planning for the gas field discovered in 2012 by the Domino-1 well. We will then move on to additional exploration drilling in the block. Turning now to Slide 19 and an update on our Downstream business. During the quarter, we achieved notable investment milestones to increase high-value product sales. We commissioned the Clean Fuels project at the Saudi Aramco Mobil Refinery in Saudi Arabia. The project reduces sulfur levels in gasoline and diesel by more than 98% to meet more stringent fuel standards in the kingdom. The project included new hydrotreating and sulfur recovery facilities and started up successfully and on budget. In China, we completed the expansion of the Tianjin lubricants plant to increase the supply of high-value Mobil-branded lubricants. Work is also underway to significantly increase the blending capacity at the Taicang lubricant plant, with expected completion by the end of 2015. Together, these 2 projects will increase our local capacity by 75% and help meet the growing demand for high-quality lubricants in China. We also recently approved a project to install a new 50,000 barrels per day delayed coker unit at our Antwerp refinery in Belgium. The unit will convert low-value residual oil from our Northwest Europe refineries into higher-value transportation fuel products such as diesel. This is another example of selective investments we are making at our competitively advantaged sites, further strengthening our industry-leading portfolio. Startup is planned for 2017. Turning now to Slide 20 and an update on our Chemical business, where we are also progressing several projects to grow high-value product sales. We received all final regulatory approvals and started construction of a multibillion-dollar ethane cracker at our existing fully integrated Baytown, Texas, complex and associated premium product facilities in nearby Mont Belvieu. The steam cracker will have a capacity of up to 1.5 million tons per year and provide ethylene feedstock for further chemical processing at 2 new 650,000 tons per year high-performance polyethylene lines. This project is made possible, in large part, by abundant affordable supplies of U.S. natural gas for energy and chemical feedstock. The expansion will enable us to economically supply rapidly growing demand for high-value polyethylene products used in a variety of consumer and industrial applications. Startup is planned in 2017. We also recently approved expansions of our specialty hydrocarbon fluid facilities in Antwerp and Singapore. These projects will upgrade refinery streams into higher-value specialty chemical products to serve rapidly growing demand in extended-reach drilling, hydraulic fracturing and other industrial applications. These investments underscore the benefits of our business integration and technology advantage to capture advantage feedstocks and increase high-value product sales. Startups are planned in 2015 and 2016. I would like to conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. ExxonMobil's strong financial and operating results reflect our ability to grow cash flow and provide robust shareholder returns, as we presented during the Analyst Meeting in March. Total earnings year-to-date, $17.9 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program. In the Upstream, production of 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is right in line with our plans. Actions we took to improve Upstream profitability and grow higher-margin production increased unit earnings to $22.19 per barrel, up from $18.03 a barrel in 2013. In the Downstream and Chemical businesses, we progressed attractive investments to strengthen the portfolio and continue to leverage integration benefits. Our strong operating results, combined with our disciplined capital allocation approach, generated robust free cash flow of $14.8 billion, an increase of $12.1 billion compared to the first half of 2013. This strong performance enabled us to maintain industry-leading shareholder distributions. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: David, what have the impacts of sanctions been on your operations in Russia? David S. Rosenthal: Yes, look, Paul, I know our activities in Russia are a matter of great interest to you and everybody else on the call and rightfully so. But what I can tell you as of this morning is that we are waiting for further details on the sanctions in order to better understand how we need to comply. But I have to tell you, given that we simply don't have sufficient information, I'm just not in a position this morning to comment any further on the impact of the sanctions. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Okay. The CapEx in Russia, is that financed from within Russia? I was thinking that given the scale of your operations in Sakhalin, maybe it's kind of an internally -- an internal Russian financing operation? David S. Rosenthal: Yes, I really don't have the details of that. We finance our operations in a number of different ways. And I don't really have a specific comment on Sakhalin or the rest of our activities. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: So essentially, the status is that we're -- you're waiting for more clarification on any limits that may be placed on, I guess, investment and operations? David S. Rosenthal: Yes, and as you know, what's been in the press has been people's thoughts and expectations, but we really just haven't seen the detailed written sanctions. And so until we have those and have a chance to assess them and evaluate them, again it just puts me in a position this morning where I really can't make any specific comments. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Understood. And then my follow-up is totally separate. The construction started at Baytown you highlighted, that, I think, is advanced against schedule, isn't it? And is that fully permitted, and obviously, final investment decision and everything else? And what is the expected completion date? David S. Rosenthal: Yes, that project is right on our plan. We do have all of our permits in place. Construction has started. We put that picture in the slides this morning to kind of show we're digging dirt and the project's underway. Even throughout the permitting process, we were well underway getting all the engineering lined up, all the contractors, all the supply chain so that once we had the permits, we were ready to go. So no change to what we told you at the Analyst Meeting. We're on schedule so far, and we do expect to have that project up and running sometime in 2017. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So a couple of questions, please. The promise of improving on operating cash flow is obviously a big theme from your Analyst Day. We don't really see any substantial margin change this quarter with the startup of PNG and, I guess, Kearl ramping up. So I'm just wondering if you can frame for us how you see the -- what the drivers of that change in cash flow are in terms perhaps of how the margin could change for your new portfolio of assets, which I guess will be about a quarter of the company in 2017? And any color you can give, qualitatively if necessary, but just to give some comfort that, that turn is coming? And I've got a follow-up, please. David S. Rosenthal: Yes, sure, Doug. Let's talk about that a little bit as we look at how things have really evolved over the last, say, 12 months. We have seen some pretty significant increase in our unit profitability and our ability to capture changes in the realizations as they come along. If I look at where we are so far in the first half of '14 on Upstream profitability relative to 2013, we're up over $4 a barrel on unit profitability. And if I go back and I take out all of the asset management, asset sales, related gains in all the periods, unit profitability is up right at $2. So I think you're starting to see the impact of the trend that we talked about in the Analyst Meeting of reducing our exposure to lower-margin barrels and barrels where we don't have quite the upside potential. And you're just now starting to see some of the projects that we've talked extensively about coming online. I mean Papua New Guinea LNG is an example. It's just started up, but it's one of several projects to come on in the next couple of years, as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, all of which are accretive to average unit profitability and average unit cash flow. So I think, in our production volumes, we're starting to see the benefit of that. Again, it's early. We've just started up the project. We have a number of projects yet to come over the course of the year. Of course, Papua New Guinea will be ramping up. We'll have the Lucius project coming up later in the year. And I might give you an update on that, as you know, at the time of the Analyst Meeting, and when we put out our F&O review, we had a 15% interest in the Lucius project. That interest is now up to 23% -- a little over 23% through a normal redetermination exercise as well as our exercising our preemptive rights on the Apache sales. So that project will be starting up later this year, and again, we'll have about 23% of those barrels. Hadrian South will also start up at the same time. So again, the projects we talked about are on schedule, and they're coming online. And they will be accretive to those, to the unit profitability we talked about. There's a number of other things that you see as we progress through and looking at the year-to-date cash flow, including an active asset management program, and you saw the impact of that. So as I kind of look back really at the first half and kind of staying away from the first quarter versus the second quarter and looking at the 6 months, we are spot on the outlook we gave you on production in the Analyst Meeting. As you've seen in our supplement, U.S. liquids production is up fairly significantly, and we continue to grow that production as we said we would. That will also add to the improving margins. So cash flow's good. Free cash flow is dramatically better than last year. We're continuing to provide the shareholder with strong returns. We raised the dividend again, as you know, almost 10% in the second quarter. So as we kind of sit back, and we look at the first half results and compare to what our plans were and compared to last year, we're very encouraged and very confident that we'll continue to deliver the growth that we had talked about and continue to trend up on unit profitability and the cash flow. So from our perspective, everything's right on track, and we look forward to continuing to deliver the commitments we've made to the shareholder. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I'll make my follow-up a very quick one, hopefully. So assuming the spending level does hold around the $37 billion number, all things equal, it's the age-old question for you guys : You're going to have a lot of free cash flow. How are you thinking about the dividend nowadays as opposed to stepping up the buyback? Because when we traveled recently, I think your message was, \"well, that cash flow will go back to shareholders.\" So if you could help frame the importance of one over the other as you stabilize the underlying production base, that would be helpful. And I'll leave it there. David S. Rosenthal: Sure. Thanks, Doug. As you mentioned, at constant prices, yes, as we deliver the plan that we outlined at the Analyst Meeting, we do expect to see a continued increase on our cash flow generation. And keeping the CapEx at the levels we discussed would, by definition, improve free cash flow, again just as we've seen dramatically here in the first half. In terms of the capital allocation, no change to our prior approach. We're going to stay disciplined on the capital. We're going to fund our best projects. And I think, as we've talked about in the Analyst Meeting and folks are beginning to recognize, our opportunity portfolio is quite extensive at this point, and that's going to allow us to be selective. So we'll continue to be disciplined on the capital side. We will continue to pay a very consistent and increasing dividend over time, and I think you've certainly seen evidence of that over the last few years. And after you accomplish those 2 things, the rest of the cash flow will flow back to the shareholder through the share buyback program. So no change in approach, no change in how we're doing our capital allocation, but again, we are certainly looking forward to continued success in our project ramp-up, continued success in upgrading the value of our molecules in the Downstream and Chemical and delivering that profitable growth that we talked about a lot in the Analyst Meeting. So thank you. Operator : We will go next to Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : David, very small question first, just on asset sale gains in the quarter, if you shout out the actual number in this quarter, if you have that? David S. Rosenthal: Sure. In total, the gains from asset sales on an absolute basis were about $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion of that in the Upstream and the other $100 million in the Downstream and Chemical. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Let's talk bigger picture about the Permian. Obviously, at the Analyst Day, you spoke about 1.5 million acres. Do you have a breakdown of how much of that is kind of CBP, how much is that is Midland? [Audio Gap] Delaware Basin for more the application of horizontal drilling? David S. Rosenthal: Sure. I'll start out by saying, if you look at that whole 1.5 million acres, it is spread throughout the Midland basin and the Delaware Basin. We're in a number of different areas, and that really gives us the opportunity to do a number of things to grow our production there, including a lot of things in the conventional fields, water floods, CO2 floods. We've got 65 workover rigs still running in the Permian, in addition to the other rigs that we have drilling exploration wells. So we have a lot of exposure to both conventional and unconventional, again, across -- broadly across the basin in Texas and in New Mexico. As we look at the various areas that I know people are interested in, we certainly have some very good acreage in the prime areas for the Wolfcamp, and we're just getting started in there. The Bone Springs is another one that we're working on. So when you look at this ramp-up in growth that we've seen to date, and you've seen the numbers of the significant growth in liquids in the U.S. year-over-year, we are just now beginning to scratch the unconventional plays and getting some of those wells down and see what we've got going on. We've got about 5 rigs drilling horizontal wells today in, again, the Wolfcamp, the Bone Springs and a number of areas. We have brought 93 wells online this year. That's up almost 70% from last year about this time. So a lot of activity, a lot of growth but just scratching the surface of the potential in that area. So we're excited to have the opportunities that we have across the basin, across the platform and, in particular, the wide variety of things we have to work on in that play. So it's not just unconventional. It's a number of resource opportunities, and you'll continue to see us ramp up activity there and see that production. Again, as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, that is a big-time focus area for us, as is the Bakken where we're having tremendous success as well, and the Woodford Ardmore area. So I can tell you, sitting here mid-year, the opportunity is there. We're developing it, and we're seeing that production increase right in line with our expectations. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And if I can be very sneaky : Is it fee acreage, or is it more recently sold in the Permian? I'm thinking about the royalty position. Some are starting to disclose where they are on that. David S. Rosenthal: Oh, yes, we -- no, we've got -- most of our acreage is fee acreage. And as you know, that's a big help on the royalties. Operator : We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division : I had a question for you on the production profile. I know you kind of confirmed that you're on track to meet your full year target. 2Q came in a bit light compared to what we were looking for. I know you referenced some maintenance and European nominations were weak. Is it fair, as we kind of move into second half, to think that 2Q is a low point? I know you'll have CLOV ramping up and maybe some of that maintenance coming back online. Or any color you can give us on how to kind of think about second half of the year? David S. Rosenthal: Yes, sure. If we look at the first half in particular, if we look sequentially where the volumes came down quite a bit. Just on the liquids side, downtime was worth 66,000 barrels a day for us from first quarter to second quarter. So we had a very heavy maintenance load up in Canada; in Kazakhstan, at Tengiz; and a number of other places, in North Sea, for example. So while we did see the benefit from projects at PNG and Kearl, they were masked by, again, this planned maintenance, seasonal maintenance, but it did have quite an impact on us. As we typically do going forward into the second half, that maintenance gets done and those things come back. And the other impact we had sequentially again was a sharp reduction in gas sales. I think our demand in Europe was probably worth over 150,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day on the gas side. And then we also had some downtime. So I'd characterize -- if you're looking at the second quarter, characterized by a extremely heavy maintenance load and your typical seasonal decline in Europe volume coming off a low base, because of the low winter. So the offset of that, of course, is PNG LNG starting up. The increase you've seen in the higher-margin U.S. liquids volumes. They just weren't enough to offset these other factors. As we head into the second half of the year, you will see these maintenance items come back up, as they typically do, and then the project startups that I talked about : full ramp-up of PNG LNG; and then the other projects that I mentioned, Lucius and some of the other ones. So we would certainly expect to see the benefit of both of those factors coming out of the second quarter. And that's why I really wanted to focus a little bit of time this morning on how we're doing year-to-date, because I think the real key measure of our performance and whether or not we're delivering on the targets that we established at the March Analyst Meeting is we are right on plan. In fact, we're a little ahead in some areas, like U.S. liquids production, for example; PNG LNG, a little ahead. Some other things are a little behind, European demand, for example, on the gas side. We continue to ramp up Kearl, and that progress is also looking good as we head into the second half of the year. So again, if we look past the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and focus on where we're at year-to-date and what we're expecting in the second half, I can assure you we are spot on to deliver the outlook that we gave you. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division : The second question. One of your European counterparts has just announced the -- I guess, the initial steps to form an MLP. And it seems like Exxon is flushed with assets that would probably fit very nicely into one and really highlight the underlying value that's probably not reflected in the stock. I'm just curious if that is even on the radar screen? David S. Rosenthal: Well, I'd say kind of generically everything's on the radar screen. We are just constantly looking at all of the things that are out there, all the options we have to realize full value from all of our assets, including our midstream assets. The one thing I'd remind you, if you recall, back in the 2011 and 2012 time frame, we actually sold a number of our midstream assets and realized extensive value for those. And those are reflected in the very strong gains on asset sales and cash flow we generated. Now if you look, step back and look at MLPs : Most companies are using those as a means to raise cash and finance growth or reduce their ownership costs or exposure. Those aren't strategic drivers for us. In our case, when we look at our midstream portfolio, these are strategic assets to us. We think we are monetizing the value of those, whether or not you would assert that they're adequately reflected in our share price yet. We are certainly monetizing those and maximizing the value in the integration of our full value chain and also as part of our logistics and integration between the Upstream, Downstream and chemicals. So you probably won't be surprised to know that we've taken a hard look at this and look at the assets and the opportunities, but we're -- we like what we have. We like the integration benefit. And in fact, if you've seen some of our recent announcements, we're actually investing more dollars in that part of the business. We mentioned the Edmonton rail project and a few other ones. So midstream assets are strategic to us. We think we're getting full value for them as part of the integrated business model that we have, but I wouldn't want you to ever think that we're not aware of and looking at everything that's out there that others are doing and some things others may not have thought about yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess, maybe come back a little bit on the Permian question, just because we did see the -- I believe there was an asset swap that you did during the quarter. And since in general we're seeing a lot more activity heading that direction, maybe could you give us an idea, a little bit of sort of relative size? I know you don't like to get into a lot of details, but kind of relative size; and as we think about growth opportunities maybe of the Permian relative to the identified projects in the Gulf of Mexico, if there's any sort of, I don't know, additional detail, clarity, something there you could offer us? David S. Rosenthal: Yes. We did sign an agreement in the second quarter to do a swap that basically added about -- additional 26,000 net acres in the Permian. And virtually all of it, it was in the Midland basin, which of course, as you know, is prospective for the horizontal drilling that we talked about. If you add that to the acreage we talked about that we picked up earlier this year, we've now added 50,000, 60,000 prime acres right in the sweet spot of where we want to be. So that's good. And that's one of the reasons why we've increased rigs in that area. I mentioned the 65 workover rigs that we're running. And I think we've got 11 rigs running on the exploration and delineation and evaluation side, so certainly ramping up activity there and very encouraged by the results we're seeing. It's a very, very active area for us. Now in terms of activity relative to other areas, I have to also say the Bakken has -- is an area where we're also ramping up production quite significantly, and you see that in our results. We've got a lot of activity there. We've got 12 rigs running. That's up from where we've been in the past. Operated production was up 26% in the second quarter. So again, we're continuing to ramp up. The other play we've talked about is the Ardmore, and we've got higher rigs running there as well. One of the things, if I just kind of think about adding all of that up and looking at our liquids plays, production across the Permian, Bakken and Woodford Ardmore in the second quarter was over 200,000 barrels a day. And that was up about over 25% from a year ago and up quarter-to-quarter. So we're continuing to work that. Comparing those opportunities to the Gulf of Mexico, we're fortunate that we've got opportunities in both of those areas. We do have major projects coming on and starting up. I mentioned Lucius, which is the oil development there starting up before the end of the year. The gas piece of that project for us, Hadrian South, will also start up and bring on additional volumes. We continue to work on Julia, and that's progressing well. And then there are a couple of other projects that we also have an interest in. So that's coming through. We've also picked up some additional very attractive exploration acreage. Recently, we were awarded the 3 blocks that we were the high bidder on right over there on the trans-boundary area bordering up against Mexico. So we've got those 3 blocks awarded to us there in the gulf, and we're hoping that'll lead to some opportunities down the road beyond that. So both of those areas are looking good. The Gulf of Mexico never delivers 100% success rate to anybody, and we've drilled a couple of dry holes ourself. But if we step back and look across the last several years and what we've got on the plate going forward, we like what we have. And we're looking forward to getting these high-margin volumes up and running here later in the year. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And then it kind of segues into what my other question was going to be. Mexico, clearly, they've made progress on the legislative side. We still need to see what the actual rules are going to be and get a good feel for timing, but can you talk a little bit about what Exxon sees as the possibilities in Mexico over the next, oh, I don't know, 3 to 5 years as this develops? David S. Rosenthal: Well, we're certainly encouraged by what we've seen to date. And we're certainly respectful of the process of deliberation that's going on and as they work through their legislative process, and we're monitoring that closely. We have a long history in Mexico, and we are certainly anxious to see how all this comes out and what opportunities might be available for us along those lines. Again, as I mentioned a minute ago, we do have those 3 blocks awarded to us right there on the boundary of the Mexican blocks in the deepwater gulf. And so we'll see if that can help generate opportunities, but we're encouraged today, anxiously awaiting the -- how all of that finalizes and all the details come out over time. And then we'll pursue any opportunities that are attractive to us, but we certainly like our position. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI. Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : So for clarification, how does the $1.6 billion of Upstream asset sales that you mentioned a minute ago reconcile with the $1.2 billion other figure that you highlighted on Slide 8? And do you have any geographical segmentation for either of those results? David S. Rosenthal: Sure. So if you're looking at the $1.2 billion that we mentioned, that was kind of the delta quarter-on-quarter, okay? And -- because we had a number of asset gains last quarter and then last year. So if you're looking at the total picture there, and again there are other items in the earnings rec, but just to be clear, in the Upstream, the total value of the asset sales in earnings was $1.6 billion in the quarter. And then if you look quarter-over-quarter, that's about $1.5 billion, with an offset of a couple of hundred million dollars in some other things like startup expenses and that sort of thing. If you're looking at the sequential comparison, we had about $400 million of gains on asset sales in the first quarter this year, so the delta there is about $1.2 billion in earnings. So I hope that sorts it out for you. And then we talked separately in the call about the impact on the cash flows. Douglas Terreson - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then secondly, over the years, ExxonMobil and its peers have employed fairly substantial portfolio management programs to support returns on capital. And with the decline in returns across the sector over the past 4, 5 years, the pace has accelerated for some companies and with positive effect on returns and their values in the market. So my question is, with ExxonMobil's returns following what the industry did over the last several years, why wouldn't the company be using portfolio strategies -- portfolio management more rather than the same, or less, to enhance its returns profile? That is, if you think that it's not. So really, any updated thinking on portfolio management strategy in light of the industry context is appreciated, David. David S. Rosenthal: Yes, yes, thanks, Doug. I would say there's really 2 items to talk about in return -- in regard to the return performance here over the last couple of years. First, with regard to asset sales, they're not linear. We had a number of asset sales in '11 and '12. And I think the combination of those 2 years yielded about $20 billion in cash flow, very strong. Last year was less of a year. This year, we're off to a pretty solid start between the first quarter and the second quarter and, in particular, what we've generated here with our asset sales. So the program is ongoing. We don't make an announcement in advance of what we're going to do. We find that gives us a little better negotiating strategy when we do actually sit down and talk about selling assets. So we don't have any stated objective. We don't have any target that we feel we must make, but we're certainly able to take advantage of anything in the market that gives us a chance to realize value for our shareholders. Fortunately, for us, we don't have to sell assets in order to make a dividend payment or another distribution because of the cash flow we generate. And again, reference back to that chart I showed you. I think one of the other things to keep in mind when you look at Upstream ROCE over the last few years, particularly in our case, and I can't speak for others. But one of the aspects of these very large legacy plateau-volume, nondeclining-volume projects, however you want to call them, is all the CapEx is upfront. And so there, as you're building these projects, and particularly in our case, I mean we talk about bringing on 1 million barrels oil-equivalent a day of production between '13 and '17. By definition, you've got a lot of steel in the ground to produce 1 million barrel of oil-equivalent a day. And until that capital starts up, that's nonproductive capital. So that, I think, at least for us, has been a big driver in terms of ROCE. And as you know, as those projects crank up, Papua New Guinea being a perfect example, you go from nonproductive capital in the ground to productive capital and, in this case, highly productive capital. So again, part of bringing all of these projects online, part of ramping up the production is the earnings, the cash flow and the ROCE that comes along with that. And then on the Downstream side, of course, we continue to have industry-leading returns and continue to make incremental investments there to at least maintain, if not increase, that advantage. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Dave, on Kearl phase 1, the ramp-up has been -- I think, probably is lower than what the investor has been expecting. From you guys standpoint internally, that -- when do you think all the startup issue will be fixed and then you will be running at a sustainable rate towards the full capacity? Is it going to take another year, 6 months? Any kind of rough time line that -- internally that you guys is forecasting? David S. Rosenthal: Yes, Paul, let me give you a quick update on Kearl, because we have seen a continued ramp-up in the production. I did -- I mentioned that in the second quarter although on the surface it looks like production was flat at about 66,000 barrels a day first quarter and second quarter. But recall we did have some planned maintenance there in April that took us way below that number. I can tell you, as we came out of that April downtime for maintenance, production picked up quite well. And in fact, we achieved record production in the month of June of almost 80,000 barrels a day. So we've not quite reached the lined-out production and our expectations, but we are making progress. A number of the issues that you are aware of are being resolved and we're working on that. Again, I have to stress that although we're certainly a little disappointed in the ramp-up over the last year from what our original expectation was, the technology is working fine. We've actually been able to run each of the 3 froth treatment trains above their designed capacity. That's very encouraging. And so the objective for us now is to get all 3 of them running simultaneously on a consistent basis at or above their designed capacity. And when we achieve that, that's when you really see that volume change. So we're encouraged at the capability of the assets that we've put in place. We're encouraged with the -- with how the technology is working. We are working on the ramp-up and look to improve that. I can't give you a specific date on which we'll achieve 110,000 barrels a day or some number greater than that, but we are making progress, and we're looking forward to continue that progress. I can also say, on the other side of the Kearl initial development, the expansion project is going very well. I'm pleased to say for another quarter that the project is on schedule and on budget, which on the backs of the Papua New Guinea LNG project, very unusual in our industry for somebody in my position to sit here on an earnings call and tell you the projects are on budget and on schedule. So acknowledged that the ramp-up in Kearl first phase hasn't been quite what we were expecting, but again want to confirm that we're making progress, and we're encouraged with the results we've seen so far this year. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Dave, you guys have some very decent success on the shale oil. Do you have a number you can share what is your total shale oil production in the second quarter average? And comparing to the full year 2013? And whether you can break it down between the black oil, condensate, NGL and gas? David S. Rosenthal: I can't break down the split between oil, NGL and gas, but the numbers I gave just a minute ago on the call across the Permian, the Bakken and the Ardmore are pretty indicative of what we're doing. Although, not all of it in the Permian, as I mentioned, is unconventional oil. But I think, without a specific number, again, when you look at the numbers that we had in the supplement to the press release, you see the 38,000 barrels a day increase in U.S. liquids year-over-year. And we look at how things are going, again, in the big three, the Bakken, the Woodford Ardmore and the Permian, we're ramping up to that level that we talked about in the Analyst Meeting, and we continue to move forward. And I'll continue to give you an update on a quarterly basis. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Can I just sneak in a quick question, a final one? There's a article, I think, out there talking about Exxon is evaluating to have a major expansion in one of your Texas refinery. That seems to be very uncharacteristic or quite different than what Exxon historically has been building or their refining strategy in the U.S. I want to see whether you can comment on that. David S. Rosenthal: Paul, the first thing I'd say is I'm not going to make a specific comment on any rumors or speculation that are out there in the press. We are regularly looking at our portfolio around the world. I mentioned the investment we're putting into the Antwerp plant, which you might say, \"Why would you be putting money into Europe given its current weak spot on the margin side?\" But again, that's consistent with our strategy of upgrading molecules, very nice project to take what is currently a low-value resid strain and upgrade it into very high-value diesel and other project -- and other products. So when we look at the U.S., when we look at Europe, when we look at Asia Pacific, we're always looking at opportunities, and what we can do to either upgrade any molecule that's flowing through our system, how we can take advantage of already-advantaged assets, like our refining circuit, and improve that. So the -- for us to be looking at many different things should not come as a surprise. But rather than mention anything specifically, and coming back to the strategy that we've articulated, I think I can really go back to what we said at the Analyst Meeting : You look at our Downstream strategy. It's all about expanding feedstock flexibility; increasing high product yields -- high-value product yields; reducing operating costs; taking advantage of logistics, like we're doing in Europe that I mentioned in my prepared remarks; or pressing even more of the value we get from integration. So I would say there's no change in that strategy per se but wouldn't comment on any specific item that you might have read in the press somewhere. Operator : Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : On Russia, I appreciate the point that the sanctions have not yet been fully clarified, but can you confirm whether the Arctic exploration prospect with Rosneft is still set to spud in August? David S. Rosenthal: Pavel, I -- again, I can understand the interest in the question, but I really have to come back to what I said at the opening. Until we have a chance to look at the sanctions, read them, assess them, evaluating -- evaluate them, it just wouldn't be appropriate for me at this point this morning really to make any comments specifically on any of our activities. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, understood. And then on the -- you guys recently applied for a approval for the Gulf Coast LNG export terminal with Qatar. Any sense of when you're expecting that approval to be given? David S. Rosenthal: I don't have a specific expectation. I think one of the things that's helpful for us is we went in a pre-FERC filing process for a while. We've been working on this, so this isn't brand new for us. I don't know exactly what the expectation is in terms of approvals or a number you have to get from the FERC, of course, from the DOE, et cetera. But I think, if you -- if we kind of look across -- how this thing might progress through the approval process, and if we can get to a position where we can FID this, you might be looking at some time frame for production around 2019, again without breaking it into its components. But nice opportunity for us. And we are certainly looking forward to an efficient process in terms of getting everything approved and getting our DOE approval for export to non-FTA countries and moving on with that project. But it's just one of many LNG opportunities we have in the portfolio. We're fortunate to have a number of things we can be working on around the world in various points of development, and this one is certainly one that we're working on real closely. Operator : Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : Just a couple of quick ones, Dave. With the PNG gas, is that all contracted sales at this stage? Because you had some spot cargoes initially. David S. Rosenthal: Yes, we've been basically -- because the project has started up months early, the current cargoes that I talked about, they're basically, by definition, going in on a spot basis. And we're pleased with our ability to place those cargoes at attractive prices. As we get down to later on and the contracts all kick in, about 95% of the production is contracted on long-term contracts tied to the price of oil. And that is certainly part of -- if you'll recall, back at the Analyst Meeting when we said we would take the percentage of our total Upstream portfolio production from about 63% or 64% liquids or liquids linked up to about 69%. This is just an example of that, but yes, those -- the cargoes that we're placing now are basically spot but into the market. But again, we've been able to place them, and pleased with how that went and then really looking forward to getting this project continuing on. And again, just very pleased with the startup and very pleased that we were able to bring that project in under a budget that was 2 years old. The industry's gotten used to those annual updates of budgets on LNG projects and costs going up annually. And again, we're very pleased that -- to bring this thing in early and under our budget. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research : Last one for me is on your tax rate. Your effective tax rate was around -- maybe you said something, but I missed it. David S. Rosenthal: Yes, let me give you a little more color on that. You did see an effective tax rate around 41% or 42% or so. That is down from last year and also a little bit down from what we saw in the first quarter. The real impact you're seeing there is just a combination of the mix of our businesses, Upstream, Downstream, Chemical; geographic; some of our portfolio management activities; the expiry of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession. Of course, as is typical, asset sales tend to have a lower tax rate than earnings from your operations. So all of that kind of drove us a little low here in the second quarter. I can tell you, without giving a specific guidance and a specific number, but a normalized tax rate going forward ought to be somewhere in the mid 40s compared to upper 40s of prior history, somewhere in that order of magnitude, just to give you a feel for how that impact might roll through going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Guy Baber with Simmons Investment Bank. Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : Just one quick one for me and more of a point of clarification. But I wanted to ask about the U.S. liquids performance relative to your internal expectations. That's an area that's outperformed our model. You've given us some great detail on the call, so thanks for that. But wasn't sure if you'd said that the U.S. liquids production was tracking in line with the internal plan or it was outperforming? So just wanted to clarify there, as we try to think through the ultimate potential of your LRS portfolio in light of some of the longer-term guidance you gave at the Analyst Day previously. David S. Rosenthal: Yes, Guy, thanks for the opportunity to clarify that a little bit. We are slightly ahead of our internal expectations for the year in the U.S. on liquids. I mentioned, in total, relative to what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting, we're kind of spot on, so -- but the puts and takes, kind of think of -- about it as still maybe a little bit behind on the Kearl ramp-up, but I addressed that earlier, but slightly ahead in the lower 48. We are very encouraged with the results we're seeing. We're very pleased with the additional opportunities. We are adding rigs. We are putting some additional resources into those areas. But bottom line, to answer your question, yes, we're a little bit ahead of where we even thought we'd be internally so far this year. Operator : And our last question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar. Allen Good - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Just quickly, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but on the U.S. natural gas production, it looks like declines have been slowing over the past few quarters. This quarter, we actually saw sequential growth. Can you talk a little bit behind the moves there and what we may expect for the rest of the year and maybe into next year as well? David S. Rosenthal: If we look at the gas business, yes, we're sequentially up just a hair but really about flat, down year-on-year, which is also consistent with what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting. So you are seeing that kind of year-on-year decline as we move those resources more into the liquid side. If we're looking sequentially, I wouldn't read too much into that. We are about flat. It's probably just timing of frac-ing and completions and bringing wells on to sale. I would say kind of as a follow-up to the prior question, everything we're doing on the gas side is per the plan, and that's a broad statement as well as in the U.S. So the second quarter, we had some good performance, but again, I wouldn't want to give an indication that our full year outlook on the gas side is any different than what we might have said at the Analyst Meeting. We are seeing the bump up, of course, from the early startup of PNG, but then on the other hand, we came out of a very warm winter in Europe and those volumes were down fairly significantly. So I think what I would just say to wrap up your question and the call : Think about all the things we laid out for you in -- at the Analyst Meeting, both strategically and the strategic choices we're making; and upgrading our portfolio, high-value, higher-margin, higher-unit-profit products into the market, that's across all of our businesses; selective investments to continue to press those strategic advantages. And then zeroing in on Upstream production volumes, right on what we had expected and maybe a little better in a couple areas. And again, if you look at that year-to-date free cash flow chart and you look at the progress we've made in a number of areas, we're -- again, we're very pleased with how our first half is turning out so far this year. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Rosenthal, I'll turn the conference back to you for closing remarks. David S. Rosenthal: Well, I would just like to thank everybody for participating on the call today and your questions, and look forward to talking with you all again in about 3 months. So thank you very much. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey Woodbury : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call. The focus of this call is ExxonMobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the quarter. And I\u2019ll refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statements shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our third quarter and year-to-date performance. First, ExxonMobil\u2019s financial results reflect the strength of the integrated business model, which creates unique competitive advantages and allows us to generate long-term shareholder value regardless of market fluctuations over the business cycle. Second year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales fully covered our net investments in the business and robust shareholder distributions. And third, we continue to meet our operational and projective development objectives. Upstream production volumes for 2014 remain on track to average 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by year end, as the company delivers new production from project start-ups and work programs. All of which are enhancing our financial performance. Now moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economy showed mixed results in the third quarter. In the U.S., the economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, however China\u2019s economic growth tapered slightly, while the European economy showed further sign of weakness. As you know crude oil prices decreased sharply and Henry Hub gas prices also weakened. The WTI spread to brand, narrowed whereas global industry refining margins were essentially flat as stronger European margins were offset by weaker margins in the U.S. And finally, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened during the quarter. Turning now to the financial results shown on slide 5. ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings were $8.1 billion or $1.89 per share. Corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, were $3 billion. CapEx was 9.8 billion in the quarter and just over $28 billion year-to-date, down 14% when compared to the first 9 months of 2013. Cash flow from operations in asset sales were $12.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $5 billion and debt was just shy of $22 billion. Next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased by $1.3 billion from 6.3 billion to $5 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program, yielded $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business, of $7.9 billion, and our shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding\u2019s are expecting to continue at $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. Now moving to slide 7 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings of $8.1 billion, increased by $200 million from the third quarter of 2013 as you can see higher downstream, and chemical margins were partly offset by lower upstream liquids realizations and higher corporate and financing expenses. In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 8, earnings decreased by $710 million. Lower gains on upstream asset sales were partially offset by higher downstream and chemical earnings. Our guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter. Turning now to the upstream financial operating results starting on slide 9. Upstream earnings in the third quarter were $6.4 billion, a decrease of $297 million versus the third quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings by $670 million driven by lower liquid prices, and in this regard on a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations decreased by $10.48 per barrel. And worldwide natural gas realizations decreased by $0.42 per thousand cubic feet, as lower European realizations were partly offset by higher U.S. gas prices. Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings by $340 million. Higher margin, production growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola, and North America as well as the net over lift, were partly offset by higher planned maintenance activities, lower entitlements and fuel decline. Moving to slide 10, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, our oil equivalent production decreased by 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Importantly liquid\u2019s production was up 14,000 barrels per day, increased production from onshore U.S. work programs, Canada and Angola were partly offset by divestment in tax in Iraq and Canada as well as scheduled maintenance in U.S., Nigeria and Russia. Natural gas production was down 319 million cubic feet per day as expected field decline in the U.S. and unfavorable entitlement impacts from pipeline gas in Qatar were partly offset by new high margin production from Papua New Guinea LNG. In short our volumes performance demonstrates the progress being made to high grade our portfolio mix with higher margin liquids and liquids linked gas production. As previously indicated we remain on track to produce 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day in 2014. Turning now, to sequential comparison starting on slide 11, our upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion dollars versus the second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $850 million with worldwide crude realizations down $7.29 per barrel and natural gas realizations down to $0.56 per 1000 cubic feet. Again, favorable sales mix effects, increased earnings by $460 million reflecting profitable growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola and Canada and a net overlift partially offset by lower seasonal demand in Europe. All other items reduced earnings by $1.1 billion primarily driven by the absence of the prior quarter Hong Kong power divestment gain. Upstream after tax per earnings per barrel were $18.65 excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Moving on to slide 12, volumes were essentially flat versus the second quarter. However liquids production was up 17,000 barrels per day due to growth in Angola and U.S. partly offset by higher planned maintenance in the U.S., Nigeria and Russia. Natural gas volumes were down 155 million cubic feet per day reflecting lower seasonal demand in Europe partly offset by a full quarter of Papua New Guinea LNG volumes. Moving now to the downstream financial, and operating results starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter, over $1 billion, up $432 million from the third quarter of 2013. Higher refining margins increased earnings by $820 million whereas volume and mix effects added another $100 million. All other items decreased earnings by $490 million which mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Turning to slide 14, sequentially third quarter downstream earning increased by $313 million, higher non-used refining margins increased earnings by $310 million positive volume and mix effects due to lower maintenance were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and another effects. Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results shown on slide 15, third quarter chemical earnings were $1.2 billion up a $175 million versus the prior year quarter mainly due to high commodity product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were more than offset by increased planned maintenance activities. Moving to slide 16, sequentially our Chemical earnings increased by $359 million due to higher commodity and specialty product margins. Moving now to an update on our year-to-date cash flow growth shown on slide 17, strong year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales of $41.5 billion more than covered the net $22 million invested in the business and $17.6 billion distributed to our shareholders. Mainly cash is used for other financing activities including debt reduction. Overall free cash flow of $19.4 billion represented increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This year year-to-date free cash will growth, reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management program and disciplined capital allocation. Turning now to slide 18, I\u2019d like to provide an update on project startups that will deliver profitable growth. We remain on track for a record startup year and planning to add 300,000 net-equivalent barrels per day of production capacity, that is indicative of the diversity of our resource base. We continue to demonstrate our world class project execution capabilities and have made significant progress during the year. For June, three major projects were started up as you know Papua New Guinea LNG came online a few months ahead of schedule and reached full capacity in July. In Angola, the CLOV reached full capacity in third quarter just a few months after first production and in Malaysia Damar started up in the first quarter. Recently, we achieved several additional project milestones. In Indonesia, the second well pad at the Banyu Urip project started up adding another 10,000 barrels per day of early production. Banyu Urip is now producing nearly 40,000 barrels per day. Construction of the central processing facilities as shown in picture is near complete and uploading offshore storage vessel which recently towed to its location for a final hookup. The project will reach full fuel capacity of 165,000 barrels per day in 2015. In Malaysia the tap is to enhance to oil recovering project which is the first large scale UR project in the country was completed. Project is utilizing a water alternating gas injection process to sweep remaining oil reserves to producing wells, increasing overall recovery. Also, the Qatargas II maintenance project was completed, enabling the venture to maintain 10 million tons of annual LNG production for the years to come. Project added well capacity a new onshore facilities for sulfur handling. In the fourth quarter we also expect to start up several additional major projects closing out our 2014 plans. In our offshore Sakhalin project in Russia, the first production well at Arkutun-Dagi is currently being drilled, offshore facility hook up and commissioning activities are nearing completion following the installation of platform top size this summer. Startup is anticipated around year-end and the field is expected at add 90,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production. In the Gulf of Mexico hook up and commissioning activities for both the Hadrian South and Lucius developments are underway. At Hadrian South we finished drilling the two subsea wells earlier this year. And installation of the subsea facilities for tieback to the Lucius far is now complete. Startup of both projects is expected before year-end. In Canada the Cold Lake Nabiye project is moving into the final stages of completion. Hydro testing and commissioning activities are occurring in support of plant startup and steam injection is expected around the end of the year. This project will add another 40,000 barrels per day to Cold Lake production. I would now like to turn to slide 19 for an update on U.S. onshore liquids growth; we are generating significant cash flow by growing high margin liquids production in the U.S. primarily in unconventional place. In the Bakken our resource base is now approaching 1 billion oil crude and barrels and gross operated production is up more than six fold since we first entered the play in 2008. The Bakkan remains our most active conventional play and is the liquids growth engine in U.S. Gross operated production has increased 38% year-on-year reflecting higher activity levels. Currently running 13 rigs up from 10 in the third quarter of 2013, net increase, new wells brought online by 25% year-on-year. We continue to achieve strong results and increased efficiencies through our development drilling in the core areas. Optimizing completions and leveraging pad development, in this regard drilling and completion costs have been reduced by 25% since 2011. We also successfully employed our proprietary extract technology to reduce costs by eliminating the need for multiple plugs, normally required for fracking. In the Woodford shale, we\u2019re running 10 rigs, gross operated oil equivalent production in the liquids rich Ardmore Marietta area has increased by 25% year-on-year, driven my more completions, strong well performance and the move to pad development. Year two, well completion times have decreased significantly, reducing costs and increasing the number of wells drilled per rig year. Although rig counts have remained basically flat, we have increased the number of new wells by 33% year-on-year. In 2014, we also increased drilling activity in the Marietta basin, timed with the completion of infrastructure there. We\u2019re encouraged by the initial work in Marietta, which has an even higher proportion of liquids in the Ardmore area. And lastly 8% year-on-year on a large legacy production base reflecting tripling the number of rigs we had in the third quarter of 2013, along with approximately six conventional productions. We continuously look for opportunities to add attractive acreage 4,000 net acres in the heart of the expanding Wolfcamp play, as shown on the map in blue. Turning now to slide 20 for an update on our exploration activities. In Romania, drilling activities at Domino-2 are complete; the well was drilled to gather more information on the 2012 Domino discovery to assess the size of the resource and its commerciality. Domino-2 is being followed by the Pelican South-1 wildcat, which is currently being drilled. Additional exploration targets are also planned. In Tanzania, Statoil and ExxonMobil made a seventh discovery in block 2. Giligiliani-1 well discovered gas in the western part of block 2. The well confirmed an additional trillion cubic feet of gas in place, bringing the total estimated resource in place up to 21 trillion cubic feet. In Argentina, drilling and testing continue in the Vaca Muerta, where we have drilled and successfully tested 2 ExxonMobil operated horizontal wells. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average initial rate of 770 barrels of oil per day, and is currently on the long-term test. And I\u2019ll note that this is the highest unconventional oil production rate test in Argentina. The La Invernada X-3 well began testing at September with encouraging initial results, although still clinging up. Our active program continues with additional drilling and testing later this year and into 2015. And finally, in Russia, we successfully drilled the University-1 well in the Kara Sea. I can confirm that the well did encounter hydrocarbons, however results are under evaluation, it would be premature to comment any further at this time. Well was safely plugged and abandoned and the rig has departed to location. So in conclusion, today\u2019s presentation provides a summary of our year-to-date performance, ExxonMobil\u2019s strong financial operating results, demonstrate the value of our integrated business model and unique competitive advantages. Total earnings were $26 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing asset management program. And the upstream production of 3.9 million, oil-equivalent barrels per day remain in line with our plan as we add new production from project start-ups and work programs. We continue to improve our production mix with unit profitability increasing from $18 per barrel in 2013 to just over $21 per barrel year-to-date. A strong operating results combine with our disciplined capital allocation approach, generate a robust free cash flow of $19.4 billion, an increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This favorable performance enabled us to maintain industry leading, shareholder distributions at $17.6 billion. That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you Mr. Woodbury [Operator Instructions]. And we\u2019ll first go to Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes, and may I say welcome on behalf of [Indiscernible] to the new role. Jeffrey Woodbury : Thank you Ed. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : So obviously your net income margins probably surprised most people, they seem to go up as the oil price pulled back. You\u2019ve got new projects obviously coming on-stream, and I can see that your exploration expense was a little bit low, which is kind of non-cash. But can you give us some color as to why you think net income per barrel went up in the U.S. and international? Little surprised. Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, I mean we broadly say Ed that it starts with the integrated business model. You\u2019re all very aware that we\u2019ve got a very cyclical nature of our business, and our business model is focused on creating shareholder value by participating through that whole value chain. So it provides robust earnings performance despite the cyclical nature. If you think about just the overall upstream unit performance, as I said, we\u2019re up year-to-date versus 2013, by about $3 per barrel. Half of that is asset management impacts, another half improved profitability, primarily due to improved liquids mix as well as higher profitability around our gas projects, really good progress by the organization, in improving the higher margin production, as I said in the presentation. Ed Westlake \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay and a second unrelated question just around Kearl, I mean obviously that is a big project and there is the Kearl expansion and potential de-bottlenecking maybe just give us an update of the latest status, and a bit more detail there, thank you. Jeffrey Woodbury : Sure, thanks for that Ed. Kearl, as we\u2019ve said many times, is a long life asset, it\u2019s advantaged. Obviously it\u2019s advantaged because of the prior technology that we\u2019ve implemented where it foregoes the need for an upgrade. Overall, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re making progress quarter-on-quarter on Kearl. Currently we\u2019re consistently producing over 100,000 barrels of oil per day, as we ramp up production there; we\u2019re clearly identifying opportunities where we can further enhance the facility reliability. I will say that we did take a turnaround in September, for planned maintenance, and all of these learning\u2019s are being fully integrated into the expansion project. As you know, we talked about the importance of capturing the learning\u2019s from the initial development, and that was a key element of their investment decision to progress right into the expansion. Likewise as we get more and more comfort with the operability of the initial development, those learning\u2019s are being integrated in the expanse project as well. So overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the asset, as I said; it\u2019s a long life asset that\u2019s going to provide very stable productions. And quite frankly Ed, we\u2019re in our sweet spot right now, we have \u2013 this is what we do very, very well in terms of our project execution, and then optimizing our operations to make sure that we maximize the value \u2013 Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Phil Gresh, JPMorgan. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Hey good morning. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Phil. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Just kind of following up on the question about the margin lift in the quarter and past couple of quarters, just kind of wondering how you would think about, how we should think about the next year or so. And what\u2019s the potential benefit you could see, in particular from cost levers. As we\u2019ve seen the oil price come down, what leverage do you think you can pull around cost and/or CapEx? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah Phil that\u2019s a great question, I mean clearly the market has seen some changes with prices. I don\u2019t think any of us should be surprised given the oversupply and continued economic weakness. I\u2019ll go right back Phil, toward the value of our integrated business model, which really does position us well to capture shareholder value; it is the cyclical nature of the business. Quite frankly the market controls the price, and what we need to focus on are the variables that we do control. And to your question, those include things like effectively managing our development and operating costs, maximizing our reliability, and then optimizing the value of the molecules through the integrated business model. All along that, that has been a fundamental main stay of our corporation. And then as a key element of how we manage that, and it\u2019s always around optimizing that the cost structure within our assets that we are maximizing the value from the resources. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: And just as a clarification could you tell us how much of the 2015 CapEx is locked in at this point, what kind of flexibility you have? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, so just a little bit more about the CapEx, if I could step back a moment, as you all know our CapEx has grown through years, and it peaked in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. And that was largely driven by a deliberate decision to progress several high value upstream research projects, upstream resource projects that were ready and matured to move forward. And now we\u2019re trailing down to what I consider a more of a normal spin pattern of just shy of $37 billion. Now the upstream has dropped off a little bit more than the down \u2013 it\u2019s dropping off little more than that as the downstream in chemical are increasing their spend pattern. But you can appreciate a lot of these projects that are in current progress, that if that CapEx profile will continue into the future. Our guidance is no different Phil, in terms of about just shy of $37 billion a year for the next couple, and we continue to invest to the cyclical nature of our business. Phil Gresh \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. And then my second question would be, you obviously have a very strong balance sheet and stronger free cash flow generation, arguably stronger than most of your peers. So you\u2019re in a pretty unique position to be potentially more aggressive in this period of weaker oil prices. So maybe you could comment about how you would think about that bigger picture, whether it\u2019s the buyback program or opportunities with the portfolio? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah Phil, I would tell you, I think you assess it up pretty good, clearly the financial flexibility we have with our current debt levels in our triple credit rating position us very well to respond to potential investment opportunities, whether that be additional resource developments, investment in our downstream or chemical business that provide us advantaged benefits to the industry. It really requires us to be able to maintain a very disciplined approach to capital allocation through the business cycle, while at the same time providing industry leading shareholder distributions. So if you think about our capital allocation approach, it\u2019s first and foremost, invest in all of our attractive business opportunities that are accretive to average unit profitability and returns. Second is to continue to pay our reliable and growing dividends, and I\u2019ll remind everybody that our dividends have grown about 10% a year over the last 10 years. And then lastly is, to return the cash to our shareholders through our share buyback program. As we\u2019ve said in the past, our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding for both of our capital requirements and our shareholder distributions. But we\u2019ll access the financial markets when and if needed to meet commitments or capture opportunities. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll now hear from Doug Terreson, ISI. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI: Good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Doug. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI: So my question, regards to margin and profitability improvement as well. And you covered the mix of effects on new projects in \u2013 Abu Dhabi but you also mentioned asset management. So my question is whether these benefits that you guys are getting from asset management or of the strategic or operational variety. And so just some clarification on what you mean by that? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah so as you know asset management has been a core component of how we manage our business. We\u2019re constantly looking across the portfolio to assess how we could maximize the value of our assets, either through development or finding alternative means to go ahead and monetize those assets. So as a result, as you know, we have, had a very healthy program in terms of our divestment activities. In terms of our unit profitability, as I said year-on-year 2013, 2014-2013 the part of that increase in unit profitability was associated with our asset management efforts. By the way the example Doug, let me just remind you over the last 10 years, for instance, in our downstream we have reduced our refining capacity by more than 1 million barrels a day. Associated with divestment of about 20 plus refineries, we\u2019ve divested over 200 fuel terminals, 38 blending plants and 6000 miles of pipeline. So it\u2019s a very active program to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value to shareholder, but also positioning us strategically to continue to perform at an industry leading pace in the future. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI: Let me ask you one other question about this. So the company\u2019s always done really well optimizing cost, but has there been, and has always been, a pressure on your cost for that reason but, is there a, maybe a step up in the effort to deliver sustained cost improvements that also may be affecting the results over the last few quarters? Jeffrey Woodbury : We always focus on cost management, our cost structure Doug. I\u2019d tell you that regardless of where we are in the business cycle, that is a fundamental part of our D&A is, how do we become even more efficient than we\u2019ve had historically? And that\u2019s not only through the highly qualified people we have working here at ExxonMobil but also the application, the technologies that we have in order to position ourselves in a, even a more effective manner to increase the value of those molecules. Doug Terreson \u2013 ISI: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : And we\u2019ll now go to Evan Calio, Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hey good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Evan. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yeah, this is somewhat related to the cash flow question and discipline. What drives you to forward the 4Q buyback guidance at 3 billion, given the sequential commodity price drop or seasonality refining and that should do cash in 3Q and maybe in general what would commodity price do you need to slow the fly wheel or buyback or what the balance sheet, just kind of underwrite that through any potential downturn? Jeffrey Woodbury : Evan, I would fall back on what I indicated previously on our capital allocation approach. It\u2019s a decision that we manage internally around, whether our cash requirements in order to invest in the opportunities that we have in our portfolio. Its making sure that we continue to return cash to our shareholders through the dividend. And then we make a unique decision internally around how much additional cash are we to go ahead and distribute to our shareholders \u2013 stock buyback program. Evan Calio \u2013 Morgan Stanley : At this moment it\u2019s a quarterly-by-quarterly assessments in those kind of an up and down overtime. Is that how it\u2019s approached? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah Evan I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably much more continual than that, but generally speaking there is, if you will, a decisive point on each quarter to decide what we\u2019re going to do in the next \u2013 near future. Operator : And moving on we\u2019ll hear from Asit Sen, Cowen and Company. Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company : Thanks and good morning. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Asit. Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company : So two unrelated questions, first thanks for the color on U.S. onshore liquids, but wondering if you could quantify your production during the quarter if you could from U.S. and conventional. Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, you bet Asit. Let me just share with you, the largest part of our unconventional U.S. liquids growth is in the Permian, Bakken and Woodford. And in total those are producing in excess of $210,000 barrels a day now. And as I said in my prepared comments it is, it has really been a significant progress over the last several quarters. I\u2019d give you a little more color to that by saying that about 40% of that is in the Bakken, 35% in the Permian and the rest is in the Woodford. Great progress, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the folks there at XTO and the success they\u2019ve had here in the recent past. Asit Sen \u2013 Cowen and Company : Thanks, very helpful. And second on LNG, could you comment on how global LNG pricing adjust to lower oil prices in comparison. There is a four to six month lag, but I wonder if you could comment on that? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, I mean broadly speaking the specifics of our LNG commercial agreements are confidential, but let me use Papua New Guinea as an example a majority of the Papua New Guinea volumes are contracted in excess of 95%. They are linked to a crude price and as crude price varies, so does that LNG. Operator : Thank you we\u2019ll now hear from Blake Fernandez, Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Good morning Jeff, thanks for taking the question. Over the past six months or so, you\u2019ve announced a couple of investments in the downstream in Europe, which seems a little bit countered to what we\u2019ve seen from peers. We\u2019re basically trying to reduce their capital employed in the area. And I\u2019m just curious if Exxon is maybe taking a different view on the macro longer-term. Or if it\u2019s a scenario where you feel you have superior assets where, over time maybe just capacity rationalization occurs. And you\u2019re last standing with an unattractive asset? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah. Blake thanks for the question and the interest in that area. Clearly we are stepping out and distinguishing ourselves, but let me step back just a little bit and talk about the European portfolio and then the downstream investments. I mean clearly Europe is disadvantaged by overcapacity. And some of which is driven by the lower cost feedstock in the U.S. and the Middle East. This sector will continue to rationalize existing capacity. ExxonMobil\u2019s European assets though are advantage versus our peers due to the more efficient operations. And the integration that we have with our chemicals and lubricants manufacturing businesses. So you\u2019ll see us continue to invest in the business cycle in order to enhance our advantage position. Now specific to those investments, they are always focused around key areas like lowering our raw material costs, increasing our higher value product yields, expanding logistics capability and flexibility. And then our main stay of reducing the operating cost structure. Ultimately to high grade the products to capture market demand. So if I focus specifically by way of example on the investment in the Antwerp delayed coker, that\u2019s around investing in conversion capacity to take lower product, lower yield product, such as the fuel oil and convert it to disciplined advantage where we have higher volume and more margins. Blake Fernandez \u2013 Howard Weil : Thanks. I\u2019ll take one more if I could, you may not be able to answer this, but you mentioned the discovery in the Kara Sea which University-1. If I\u2019m not mistaken I\u2019ve read some press article suggesting that Rosneft may decide to pursue the additional drilling on their own due to the sanctions and what not. I\u2019m just kind of curious how that would unfold with regard to your relationship there. And participating in future interests? Jeffrey Woodbury : Right, well Blake thanks for the interest. Clearly this is an important area for the industry in total. And we certainly appreciate the interest. Let me first start off by just recognizing the success of the well, I mean we\u2019re extremely proud of what the organization has achieved in an extraordinarily remote arctic region, both from a logistics and a drilling perspective. The team successfully completed the well with the utmost concern for safety and the environment. And that really does speak to the strength and capability of the organization. As I said in my prepared comments, I can confirm that we encountered hydrocarbons, but this is a very large area. This acreage is over 31 million acres. We\u2019ve got one penetration in that, so it is premature to make any assessment or really say anymore at this point. We are currently evaluating results to assess the Woodford plants, we\u2019ll move forward on. I will remind you that ExxonMobil has a very longstanding and successful business in Russia, built on an affective and mutual beneficial relationship with the Russian partners. Operator : Moving on we\u2019ll hear from Jason Gammel, Jefferies. Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies: Thanks very much. Two questions for me Jeff. The first on the accelerated drilling onto North America, I know that Exxon is a company that will invest throughout the pricing cycle, but I was just wondering if the number of rigs that are being employed in this place is going to be affected by the change that we\u2019ve seen in pricing conditions just over the last several weeks. Essentially what level of onshore price would you need to see before you can perhaps start laying down rigs? And then the second question, one of your primary competitors, just this week, successfully IPO\u2019ed \u2013 MLP with pipeline assets. And there\u2019s evidently a pretty big value gap between what the stock market is willing to pay for those assets through MLP and an integrated oil stock. Have you considered any form of MLP type of transaction with your pipeline assets? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, Jason thanks for those questions. Let me first start with the unconventional, as I said really good progress, I gave a lot of details about it, very proud of what the XTO organization is achieving up there. Let me say that, these near-term price fluctuations are not going to have an impact on our operational activities. We test all of our investments across a range of economic parameters including price. And I\u2019ll just say at a high level that our current drilling programs and inventory are fairly robust in this price environment. So we\u2019re very confident with the drilling activity as I indicated, we are picking up rigs, so that we can continue to progress our resource development activities. And it is a very significant part of our growth opportunity and importantly our improvement in overall profitability. More specifically on the master limited partnership question. I talked a little bit already about our asset management program that is a fundamental aspect of how we do our business. And it\u2019s around making sure that we\u2019re making the right choices there that are maximizing value for the shareholder. We have, through the course of that process; we have really divested or monetized all of our non-strategic assets. So we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work you\u2019re hearing some folks do today. The remaining assets that we\u2019ve got in place are very strategic to the integrated model that we have between the upstream, downstream or on chemical business. The MLPs are generally used as a financing mechanism to raise cash and fund business growth, as you know with our financial flexibility we have very low cost to capital. While I will never say no, I would tell you that just the cost benefit tradeoffs for MLPs running attractive for us given our low cost to capital. Jason Gammel \u2013 Jefferies: Very helpful. Thanks Jeff. Jeffrey Woodbury : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from Roger Read. Wells Fargo. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Hi good morning. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Roger. Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Just maybe going along with that sort of capital allocation and other questions that have come on here. So CapEx plus or minus 37 billion, or maybe I should say minus 37 billion here going forward. You just made the comment, a lot of the non-strategic assets have impaired. If we do find ourselves in a, let\u2019s say $80 to $85 oil environment, between the share repurchase program at around 3 million a quarter, the CapEx at 37 billion. And maybe not as many assets left to sell, at least from a non-strategic or non-core standpoint. How do you balance all of that, what gives, is it CapEx that gets pulled back, is it the share repurchase or is the \u2013? Jeffrey Woodbury : And I don\u2019t want you to walk away from this thinking that there won\u2019t be any other divestment opportunities, because it is a continual process. Think of it as an ongoing upgrade of our overall portfolio whereby we continue organic exploration, identify higher up value assets, we continue to high-grade our down streaming chemical facilities. So it\u2019s an ongoing process that will likely continue to yield periodically divestment opportunities, Roger Read \u2013 Wells Fargo : Okay thanks, and taking another look at your lower 48 unconventional opportunities and ranking those in terms of returns or growth plus returns to some of your other opportunities, how do they scale up, or maybe as you just said, what is your best return opportunity today and where they fit in relative to that? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, I would tell you Roger that they all are very strong. There\u2019s a lot of variability even within a given resource area depending on where you are in the trend. And I would tell you that ExxonMobil has prime acreage in all three of the areas that I talked about, as well as some others. So we are very well positioned, and as you saw with the Permian basin, we continue to look for opportunities to high-grade the overall portfolio on those basins, so very strong inventory that we continue to high-grade and look for opportunities for progressing the investment opportunities in each one of those fields. So we would not expect any change in our operational plans, thank you Roger. Operator : Moving on, we\u2019ll hear from Allen Good, Morningstar Investment Research. Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research : Good morning, just another follow-up question on the lower 48 unconventional, as you mentioned you\u2019ve been pretty active in Permian acquisitions. I just wonder what\u2019s Exxon\u2019s thought, as far as what\u2019s the right size Permian position that you eventually want to get to, to get that to scale. And is there a preference for Permian acquisitions to relative to Woodford and Bakken or is it just been a case of value? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah Allen, it\u2019s always a case of value for us. I wouldn\u2019t say that we are excluding any opportunity in the US or internationally. Now we have found a number of opportunities to high-grade the portfolio in the Permian recently, but we continue to keep very well alert to other opportunities that may come up. And maybe even with the current decrease in prices, we may have additional opportunities that we\u2019ll find they are complementary to our business and can increase our overall underlying value. And I would take that \u2013 I\u2019d extend that beyond the U.S., we\u2019ve leveraged the expertise within the U.S. unconventionals to position ourselves strategically for other unconventional opportunities globally. Allen Good \u2013 Morningstar Investment Research : Great, thanks. And just one on the downstream, Exxon obviously has a very large downstream global footprint, can you give us any color on what you\u2019re seeing as far as the demand side, given the slide we\u2019ve seen in oil prices. And a lot of concern out there is, I\u2019m not saying on the supply side, but weak demand. I was just wondering if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the demand patterns of late, given the lower prices. Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, well I mean as I said in the presentation, we did some margin improvement, but generally demand has been fairly strong within the U.S., particularly in our chemical\u2019s business. But in Europe, Asia Pacific, demand has been down and that\u2019s really a function of building capacity faster than demand, as well as economic weakness. But you\u2019ve got to step back from a chemical\u2019s perspective, for instance, we\u2019re expecting demand to grow at 1.5% above GDP. And we\u2019re a long-term business where we invest for the long-term and it\u2019s all fundamental to energy outlook, and demand projections. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng, Barclays. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Hey Jeff, good morning. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Paul. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Well first, just want to add my welcome to the Investor Relations. Jeffrey Woodbury : Thank you Paul. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Several quick questions, on the page 11 of your presentation, the other is a negative $1.1 billion comparing to the second quarter. In the second quarter there\u2019s about $1.6 billion of the other sales gain related to the Hong Kong power. And your exploration expanse is lower, so then maybe adding another 100 million, 150 million in earning. So that\u2019s about $300 million to $400 million of other benefits. Can you help us with that in terms of what that benefit may be, the nature? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yes, so you\u2019re looking at, Paul, the sequential earnings reconciliation? Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: That\u2019s correct. Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, so as I said in the presentation, that was down about $1.1 billion and I would, at a high level, say that its asset management is down about 1.3. It\u2019s a net effect of the absence of Hong Kong power as well as other acquisition activities that occurred during that period, as well as, I think you appropriately pointed out, that other operational items were positive by about $160 million, due to lower OpEx primarily in exploration as well as some minor for ex-benefits. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: So you\u2019re saying that there was a swing is 1.3, so that means we have about 300 million or so, sales gained in this quarter? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Ian Reid, BMO. Ian Reid \u2013 BMO: Hi Jeff. Jeffrey Woodbury : Good morning Ian, how are you? Ian Reid \u2013 BMO: Yeah, very good. Can I ask you a quick question about Papua New Guinea? Now you\u2019ve got the first part of the project, or at least phase 1, fully on-stream, what is your thinking about adding the third train, utilizing the additional gas which a joint venture has discovered in the region. And also, potentially processing third party gas or building another train to process third party gas. Can you just kind of outline Exxon\u2019s thinking about that? Jeffrey Woodbury : Sure Ian, thanks for bringing up Papua New Guinea because it\u2019s another very successful accomplishment for the organization. I would tell you that everything is on the table, in terms of what we do there. Obviously, first and foremost, is that in terms of our priorities is to make sure that we are very comfortable, the operating structure, as I said, started up early. We got up to peak production, is operating very, very well, the project team and operations organization has done a remarkable job there. You\u2019re aware that there\u2019s some \u2013 we maintain an active exploration program in Papua New Guinea. We have picked up some additional resource; there are some other exploration opportunities that we\u2019re considering. And I would tell you that the next step would be to consider \u2013 and has been under review, the economic viability for incremental trends, here at the LNG plant. It was designed in order to easily tie in additional trends, so we\u2019re very well positioned. And as you can appreciate, the incremental cost expand the PNG facilities is going to be much, much more competitive than other Greenfield site. So in summary I\u2019d say that we\u2019re very pleased with the resource, the overall potential and performance of Papua New Guinea. We\u2019ve got some additional resource out there with the successful P\u2019nyang discovery. And we\u2019re looking for opportunities to add to it, and that can come, either through additional resource development or, as you indicated, processing third party gas. Ian Reid \u2013 BMO: Okay, thanks. And just one further thing, on the Russian sanctions, how is that affecting your Sakhalin developments, and also the LNG project which you\u2019re progressing with \u2013? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, very good. I feel to mention that when we were talking \u2013 Ian Reid \u2013 BMO: [indiscernible] loss of PSE volume as result of rising oil prices can you provide some sensitivity on earned up there and how much production you get back if oil stays around $85? Jeffrey Woodbury : Well Jason, I don\u2019t have the specific numbers at the price that you stated but I would tell you that sequentially in our sequential earnings that there were some positive effects to, associated with PSE volumes. It was under 10,000 barrels per day, second quarter to third quarter. Ian Reid \u2013 BMO: Got it ok that\u2019s all for me. Operator : And we\u2019ll now hear from Ryan Todd, Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : A question you already touched on CapEx and CapEx outlook a few times during the call but if we take step back and look a number of your European peers, there\u2019s been kind of a clear trend and may be for a variety of reasons, clear message and strong efforts towards capital constraint deferral of certain projects and free cash flow going forward from that point of view? It\u2019s been a bit more muted here in the U.S. may be how, if there\u2019s been a shift in your approach to project economics and relative returns and profitability as you, like your go forward portfolio and the potential of the constrain more CapEx or prices impacts there whatsoever? Jeffrey Woodbury : We always are our ends are set well in advance as I said earlier our investment, full range of economic parameters including price so that we have the comfort, that we\u2019re going to end up regardless of the type of price fluctuations that we feel like the program is robust. Or any great business model is that we invest into these business cycles and we\u2019ve got the financial projects if we need some additional capital. Ryan Todd \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Specifically on Tanzania you guys have discovered enough lot of gas to date can you give us any thoughts in terms of timing, in terms of your expectations and go forward plans there? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah. So on Tanzania a very good progress between Statoil and ExxonMobil as I said certain gas discoveries, now over 21 TCF in place. There is a consortium that has come together they have evaluated potential sites for common onshore LNG facility and we have made plans on site location. Studies are progressing to determine the development it really is in really early stages and it\u2019s really too early to determine a specific startup date. Overall design capacity or even the capital investment, but fundamental for us environment is to ensure that an investment of this scale and complexity is to generate an acceptable return for our shareholders. Operator : And our next question will come from Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Good Morning, just to confirm me to \u2013 on this CapEx question we keep coming back to is an interesting number again to be clear about peak of CapEx in 2013. And then you said next year\u2019s interesting variation in your spending for example even in the latest quarter we had downstream in chemicals. And beyond that, beyond the 37 net CapEx in the longer term future given that you\u2019ve highlighted to the extent to which you reached to peak in 2013 as a function of recapitalizing the upstream? Jeffrey Woodbury : Right Paul, so as I said we grew up $42.5 million in 2013 and again I want to make the point that the resource opportunities that we had before us and the maturity of those and the confidence that we had that we would generate very favorable returns for our shareholders likewise it is a conscious decision to bring our upstream spending down to a normal spend pattern. And as we communicated in early this year in our Analyst meeting we were projecting not to pull down to just south of $37 billion over the 2015 to 2017 period. And yes there is this larger increase in the downstream and chemical business and that is focused on like I talked upon Antwerp focused on making strategic investments that are going to better advantage our downstream facilities, relative to industry such as the North America ethane cracker at Baytown. Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : Level of CapEx, what do you mean by that? How do you define that normal level? Jeffrey Woodbury : Well if look at the resources going forward Paul it\u2019s based on our judgment when those resources are going to be ready whether it be the definition of the resource, the definition of the development concept the regulatory or when we believe they are ready to move forward and we have an optimal development, that\u2019s really what I mean by normal looking at our portfolio as opposed to when we saw these really large projects that came to provision together that \u2013 Paul Sankey \u2013 Wolfe Research : And just coming back to the PSE question obviously if prices were to stay here you spoke about two Q3 obviously it is relatively minor oil price shift, at the moment you are guiding to $4.1 million barrels a day next year. I assume that you\u2019re continuing with the guidance like that in the Analyst meeting but the obvious expectation be that, that number would come in higher as a result of lower oil prices even though I know, there\u2019s a different coalition around economics but broadly speaking that would be what we should work towards, right? Jeffrey Woodbury : I think Paul I would \u2013 in March at the Analyst meeting. Again we look at the range over a period of time it\u2019s going to drive what the prices do and we make our best judgment as to where we\u2019re going to fit in that in order to give you that guidance. So if you think about what we said back in Analyst meeting we said that we would grow from about $4 million barrels a day up to $4.3 million barrels a day. 1 million oil-equivalent barrels a day by 2017. And doing so we are adding up the and I\u2019ll mind you that a large part of that 95% plus was liquids and liquids linked gas production. So it will change our production mix by about 64% liquids and liquids linked to just south of 70% in 2017. So in summary I\u2019d say our guidance on volumes is still consistent with what we shared with you in March. Thank You Paul. Operator : Moving on we will hear from Alastair Syme, Citi. Alastair Syme \u2013 Citi: Hi Jeff couple of very good questions, can you maybe highlight little bit about how much you\u2019re spending on the U.S. shale piece is that something you\u2019d be willing to \u2013 and secondly just picking up on the comment you made about Qatar Jeffrey Woodbury : [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from John Herrlin, Societe Generale. John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale : Yeah, thank you. Most of the things been asked Jeff, but regarding the shale economic thresholds in North America with the Bakken, it sounded like you have a different kind of completion, it\u2019s not plug and perf, its somewhat different. Can you elaborate a little bit more, and also with that completion are you also doing similar thing in Argentina? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, good question John. I would tell you that, as I said in my comments, the XTO expertise that we built up in the unconventionals is being leveraged globally. And we are continuing to grow our capability there. As I shared in my prepared comments the improvements that we\u2019ve seen, not only in reducing overall cost, but improving the productivity of, if you will, the manufacturing process of drilling these wells. But a key element of that has been the application of technology. And as I said in my prepared comments, one of the benefits that we\u2019ve used in Bakken has been this completion technology, which is proprietary ExxonMobil technology called the XFrac. And that allows us to avoid putting a whole bunch of plugs in the well and makes it a much more efficient and safer operation for completion installation. And to close on your question about Argentina, I\u2019d broaden that and say that, that all of these learning\u2019s and they\u2019re conventional to apply elsewhere within our portfolio. And once again its, it\u2019s just another leading performance in our capability, and that positions us very well to compete for resources. John Herrlin \u2013 Societe Generale : Great. Thank you very much. Jeffrey Woodbury : Thank you John. Operator : We\u2019ll now hear from Guy Baber, Simmons & Company. Guy Baber \u2013 Simmons & Company: Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. Two quick ones for me, first question around exploration, but generally speaking, can you just remind me what percentage of the total capital budget this year is allocated to exploration appraisal activity. And then optimally, where would you like to see that percentage longer-term, just to sustain the long-term opportunities that reserve maturation, but also how comfortable you maybe in flexing that down at any point in the cycle for any given year. So that\u2019s number one, just thoughts on the exploration budget. And then secondly, just if you could quickly talk about the balance sheet, but you mentioned your excess financial markets if need be and your net debt to total cap obviously low compared to most peers. But actually high, relative to where it\u2019s been at the last 10 year period. But could you just remind us of your target leverage ratios and framework also. And just where you\u2019re comfortable in taking the leverage? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah. Guy let me first with the second, after your first question about whether we would flex down our exploration. I would tell you that we are opportunity driven, we got \u2013 in the well, we\u2019ve got a very robust inventory. It\u2019s a \u2013 we\u2019re very well positioned to compete, as I said earlier, it\u2019s all around how do you upgrade the value of overall resource base. So from an expert, we have really got to be focused on the horizon around high grading our portfolio, specific to our budget, we don\u2019t break that type of information out in terms of risk. Components within the exploration budget, but I\u2019d like you to think about our exploration activity as a means to further high grade our overall portfolio. On the second point on our leverage ratio, there is no target. We\u2019ve been fairly consistent over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve maintained the triple A credit rating. I want you all to think about it, our focus is around value. It\u2019s not always \u2013 or not a focus around market share or volume, it\u2019s around value, how can we create greater value? And we\u2019ll use that balance sheet to achieve that objective when we think it\u2019s appropriate. Operator : Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : Hey thanks very much. Just one more for me on Russia if I may, you touched on the policy sanctions related uncertainty on relation to the Archadeck. Are there any other uppered or reduced because of the sanction rules? Jeffrey Woodbury : Yeah, so you may recall a number of joint ventures throughout Russia, we talked about the Kara Sea. We also have a venture in the Black Sea and West Siberia, and then lastly, a number of ventures within the Russian arctic ship. And if you think about the sanctions, they deal with specifically deepwater, unconventional resources and arctic activity. So , the joint ventures I just summarized for you, are included within the scope of the sanctions. Pavel Molchanov \u2013 Raymond James : So have all the activities in those JV\u2019s been suspended as a result? Jeffrey Woodbury : Well we have \u2013 we are fully complying with the sanctions and regulatory requirements. Operator : And we do have one follow-up question from Paul Cheng, Barclays. Paul Cheng \u2013 Barclays: Hey Jeff \u2013 we need to know your investment in Europe refining. Do you have any plan to do a safe system? Second question, I think in your comments you were saying that you have a spec in the quarter, and also at the end of the third quarter from the inventory underneath or overneath. Thank you. Jeffrey Woodbury : Thank you Paul. On your first question around investments, I would just say broadly that we regularly evaluate our global portfolio where we have offered investment. As I\u2019ve already discussed, with areas targeting on things like expanding our feed logistics or reducing our cost structure. We have a lot of \u2013 and generally speaking Paul as a matter of practice we just don\u2019t want to comment or speculate on any particular opportunities or investments, maybe not be considering. When they\u2019re ready we will and we\u2019ve made a decision. We\u2019ll go ahead and ensure that more broadly. The second question was around over lift. And I\u2019ll just, if I can, I\u2019ll refer back to our quarter-on-quarter upstream earnings reconciliation. And if you remember there was a volume mix component about the positive $340 million. And first and foremost there was a fairly sizeable component associated with project, high margin project and program activity of over $500 million. And as I said during my prepared comments, it really highlights the progress that we\u2019re making on our unit profitability in the higher value volumes. Not for the sake of growing volumes, but for the sake of capturing value. There was an over lift component that was positive. And then there was an offsetting decrease in a number of various, such as entitlements, decline, downtime and some asset management. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr., Woodbury at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey Woodbury : Well to conclude, thank you all for your time and your interest this morning. Certainly, very good questions and I do look forward to further dialogue with you all in the near future, thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference, thank you all for your participation.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. As you know the focus of this call is ExxonMobil\u2019s financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2014. I will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site. Before we go further, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our fourth quarter and full year performance. ExxonMobil delivered earnings of $32.5 billion in 2014 and fourth quarter earnings of $6.6 billion. These results highlight the value of ExxonMobil\u2019s integrated business model which enables us to produce solid financial performance throughout the commodity price cycle. Corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of over $49 billion in 2014 and free cash flow of $18 billion, an increase of over $7 billion from 2013. We completed a record of eight major upstream projects during the year and achieved our full year plan to produce 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results, global economic growth moderated in the fourth quarter, expansion in the U.S. continued but growth slowed relative to the third quarter, China\u2019s economy decelerated, while Europe and Japan showed continued signs of economic weakness. As you know, energy prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter and U.S. refining margins decreased significantly, while chemical specialty product margins improved on lower feed and energy costs. Turning now to the fourth quarter financial results as shown on Slide 5, ExxonMobil\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were $6.6 billion or $1.56 per share. Corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter, through dividends and share purchase to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion were used to purchase shares. CapEx was $10.5 billion in the fourth quarter, whereas cash flow from operations and asset sales were 7.7 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.7 billion and debt was $29.1 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on fourth quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased from $5 billion to $4.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program yielded $7.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $9.1 billion, and shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion, debt in other financing increased cash by $7 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $1 billion in the first quarter of 2015. Moving now to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings of $6.6 billion were $1.8 billion lower than the year ago quarter. Lower earnings in the upstream and downstream and higher corporate expenses were partly offset by higher chemical earnings. Results were favorably impacted by approximately $1 billion of non-cash effects, that included U.S. deferred income tax items and the recognition of the 2012 award, by the International Chamber of Commerce for expropriated Venezuela assets. And the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $1.5 billion, primarily as a result of lower upstream and downstream earnings. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter. Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9, upstream earnings in the fourth quarter were $5.5 billion, down 1.3 billion from the fourth quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.4 billion as worldwide crude oil prices declined almost $32 per barrel. Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $400 million, driven by a higher margin production growth from the U.S. and major projects in Canada, Angola and Papua New Guinea. All other items, increased earnings by a net $640 million, including adjustments to deferred income tax balances and recognition of the gain from the Venezuela ICC award received in 2012. The ICC award was recognized, given the favorable fourth quarter ruling of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Moving to Slide 10, excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, oil equivalent production decreased by 0.7% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Liquids production was up, 80,000 barrels per day, driven by major new projects and work programs. However, natural gas production was down over 650 million cubic feet per day, as reduced entitlement volumes, lower weather-related demand primarily in Europe and field decline were probably offset by major projects in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia. In short, our volumes performance continues to demonstrate the progress being made to high-grade the portfolio mix with higher margin production. Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, upstream earnings decreased $948 million versus the third quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion, driven by sharply lower worldwide crude prices, which declined over $27 per barrel. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $140 million, reflecting higher margin volume growth. All other items had a positive impact of $1.1 billion, including the previously mentioned deferred tax items and Venezuela ICC award. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel for the fourth quarter were just over $15, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes and is down due to lower crude prices. Moving to Slide 12, volumes were up $223,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 5.8% sequentially. Liquids production increased 117,000 barrels per day from higher entitlement volumes, improved facility uptime and work programs. Natural gas production was also up 639 million cubic feet per day, driven by a higher seasonal demand primarily in Europe. Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $497 million, down 419 million from a year ago, earnings increased $40 million due to stronger marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, mostly offset by weaker U.S. refining margins. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million and all other items decreased earnings by $480 million, primarily from higher maintenance activities and unfavorable tax effects. Turning to Slide 14, sequentially fourth quarter downstream earnings decreased $527 million, lower U.S. refining margins, partly offset by stronger marketing and non-U.S. refining margins, decreased earnings by $360 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by a further $20 million and all other items reduced earnings by $150 million, reflecting higher maintenance activities, partly offset by foreign exchange, favorable foreign exchange and other effects. Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 15, fourth quarter chemical earnings were $1.2 billion, up 317 million versus the prior year quarter primarily driven by higher non-U.S. product margins on lower feed costs. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million and all other items primarily unfavorable foreign exchange effects reduced earnings by $110 million. Moving to Slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings were essentially flat as stronger specialty product margins were offset by volume and mix effects and increased maintenance activities. Now I\u2019d like to provide a summary of our full year results shown on Slide 17. 2014 earnings were $32.5 billion or $7.60 per share. Corporation distributed $23.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to reduce share outstanding. Of that total $12 billion were used to purchase shares. CapEx in 2014 was $38.5 billion which is down $4 billion from 2013 and is also down $1.3 billion from our 2014 guidance. Cash flow from operations and asset sales remain strong at over $49 billion, which included $4 billion from asset sales. Moving now to the full year cash flow statement as shown on Slide 18, during the year cash decreased from $4.9 billion to $4.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing assets management program yielded $49.2 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $31.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $23.6 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $5.4 billion to fund our commitments, including working capital requirements. Moving on to Slide 19 and a review of our full year segmented results. 2014 earnings were essentially flat with 2013 results. Higher upstream and chemical earnings were offset by lower downstream earnings and higher corporate expenses. Turing now to the full year comparison of upstream results starting on Slide 20, upstream earnings of $27.5 billion were up $707 million from 2013. Realizations reduced earnings by $2 billion as crude oil prices declined almost $11 per barrel. Importantly favorable sales mix effects increased earnings by over $500 million reflecting investments and higher margin assets and our continued focus on profitability. Volume contributions from major project startups in U.S. onshore liquid plays partly offset by lower weather-related downtime and unfavorable entitlement impacts. All other items primarily asset sales and deferred tax effects increased earnings by $2.2 billion. Upstream after tax earnings per barrel, for the year was $19.47, up a $1.44 from 2013 despite declining crude prices. Moving to Slide 21, as indicated volumes ended the year on plan at 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, excluding impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry volumes were down by 1.7% or 71,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day from 2013 reflecting lower gas demand in Europe and asset sales. Of note, liquids production was up 44,000 barrels per day or 2%. Volume growth from work programs and major projects in Canada, Angola and Papua New Guinea were partly offset by field decline and divestment impacts. Our natural gas production was down 691 million cubic feet per day, driven by lower weather-related demand, entitlement and divestment impacts and field decline, partly offset by major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia. The full year comparison for downstream is shown on Slide 22. 2014 earnings were over $3 billion down 404 million from 2013. Lower refining margins reduced earnings by $230 million, volume and mix effects mainly driven by refinery optimization activities increased earnings by $480 million. All other items primarily unfavorable, foreign exchange and tax impacts decreased earnings by $650 million. On Slide 23, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2014 earnings of $4.3 billion increased $487 million from last year. Higher commodity product margins partly offset by lower specialty margins increased earnings by $520 million. Positive volume and mix effects on higher demand were offset by all other items driven by increased maintenance activities. Moving now to an update on our cash flow growth shown on Slide 24, as mentioned annual cash flow from operations and asset sales was $49.2 billion while net investments in the business totaled $31.2 billion. Resulting free cash flow of 18 billion increased 7.3 billion compared to last year and supported total shareholder distributions of $23.6 billion. Debt and other financing along with a reduction in our cash balance provided additional funds to meet our commitments. Moving next to the fourth quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 25. Over the past year, ExxonMobil completed a record eight major projects, demonstrating a world-class project execution capabilities. We added more than 250,000 barrels per day of net capacity across a broad range of resource types and geographies. The higher margin production from these projects underscores our focus on delivering profitable growth. We completed several projects over the last quarter. In Russia at offshore Sakhalin the first well at Arkutun-Dagi field reached target depth in December with first production in early January. The early gross production from the field is expected to reach 90,000 barrels and will bring total gross production at Sakhalin-1 to more than 200,000 barrels per day. Arkutun-Dagi is the last of three fields to be developed by the Sakhalin project, the other two fields Chayvo and Odoptu began production in 2005 and 2010 respectively. In Canada, initial steam generation at the Cold Lake, Nabiye development started late December, followed by injection into the reservoir in early January. After steam soaking, the first bitumen production is expected later this quarter. Production will increase over the balance of the year with gross rates expected to reach 40,000 barrels per day. Nabiye is an expansion of existing Cold Lake field which started up in 1985 and produced almost 150,000 barrels per day in 2014. In the greater Hadrian area of the Gulf of Mexico the Lucius project was essentially completed in December with first production in January. Gross production from Lucius is expected to be around 80,000 barrels of oil and 150 million cubic feet of natural gas per day once the wells have fully ramped up. The Hadrian South subsea production system of flow lines were installed and connected to the Lucius far host in late 2014 and will be brought online once Lucius production is stabilized. Hadrian South is ExxonMobil\u2019s deepest subsea tieback at more than 7,600 feet. The early gross production from Hadrian South is expected to reach approximately 300 million cubic feet of gas from two wells. In offshore Abu Dhabi Upper Zakum is one of the world's largest oil fields with a resource estimate of 50 billion barrels. Together with our joint venture partners, we're progressing the field redevelopment to raise gross production capacity to 750,000 barrels per day. The joint venture is utilizing extended reach drilling from four new artificial islands and deploying proprietary ExxonMobil technology. Civil works are now essentially complete on all islands, drilling is ongoing from two of the islands and first production started in November of last year. Facility additions and drilling will continue over the next three years to reach the targeted production plateau. And finally the Kearl expansion project in Canada continues to track ahead of schedule. Site construction activities are now largely complete and commissioning activities are ramping up. The project incorporates the learnings from the initial development phase and will double Kearl's production capacity to 220,000 barrels per day for the next several decades. Turning now to Slide 26 for an update on our broad exploration program, drilling operations are ongoing at the Pelican South, wildcat well in the Neptune block offshore Romania. Following this well additional exploration targets in the area will be considered. In Argentina, we successfully drilled and tested two ExxonMobil operated horizontal wells in the Vaca Muerta. The La Invernada X-3 well flowed at an average rate of over 600 oil equivalent barrels per day and is currently on a long-term test. It is among the best producing wells in the Vaca Muerta. Our active program continues with additional drilling and testing in 2015. Recently, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse exploration portfolio. ExxonMobil expanded its presence in the Canadian North Atlantic by 1.6 million gross acres, capturing three blocks, offshore Newfoundland and Labrador. These blocks are in a proven oil-equivalent hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. This new opportunity will build on our 17 years of success with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. ExxonMobil also recently added significant acreage in West Africa, building upon a strong position that stretches for Iberia to Angola. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, we added 2.3 million gross acres, by successfully completing negotiations of production sharing contracts on two Deepwater Frontier blocks. These captures marked a return of ExxonMobil to C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where we produced the country's first oil 30 years ago. In Equatorial Guinea, we've completed PSC negotiations to acquire an interest in another offshore block encompassing 160,000 gross acres. The PSC is subject to final government ratification. This additional acreage builds on almost 20 years of ExxonMobil operations in Equatorial Guinea. And in the UK North Sea, we were awarded a 50% working interest and two licenses. They are part of a proven hydrocarbon province in our producing fields. ExxonMobil and Shell, bid jointly for these licenses which cover more than 250,000 gross acres. So in conclusion, our full year results underscore the value of our integrated business model. In 2014, ExxonMobil earned $32.5 billion and we achieved our full year plan to produce 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. We maintained our disciplined capital allocation approach by selectively investing in attractive opportunities, thereby improving our production mix. Unit profitability increased from just over $18 per barrel in 2013 to about $19.50 per barrel in 2014 despite lower prices last year. Corporation generated free-cash flow of $18 billion an increase of over $7 billion when compared to 2013 and we maintained strong shareholder distributions totaling $23.6 billion. In summary, we delivered on our commitments and we remain resilient through the cycle. Finally, I\u2019d like to mention two upcoming events. First in mid-February, we'll be releasing our 2014 reserve replacement data. And second as many of you may know, our upcoming Analyst Meeting will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday March 4th with a live webcast beginning at 9 :00 AM Eastern Time. We will provide an update to our business strategies and our investment plans during the meeting. Presentation will be led by ExxonMobil's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rex Tillerson. That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Jeff because the Company is so diverse and functioning geographically your commentary on global economic activity has always been pretty helpful and based on your remarks at the beginning, it seems like economic trends in the OECD and China, weakened materially during the second half and specifically in the fourth quarter so, my question is whether or not you have additional color or updates in those areas and also any commentary and/or color on economic activity trends that you are seeing in the non-OECD as well? Jeff Woodbury : I would say broadly speaking, I'll pull back on our overall assessment of what demand will be doing across the globe, particularly in Asia Pacific. We are forecasting that demand and of course as I've said previously, that demand assessment that we do on an annual basis, really underpins our business strategies and our investment plans. So, as we look forward, we see oil demand growing at about 0.8% per year, that's underpinned by transportation and chemical needs. In the gas sector, we see gas demand growing by about 1.5%-1.6% per year and that's primarily underpinned by power generation and industrial demands. Now overall demand growth is largely underpinned by the non-OECD growth so when you think about our business the scope of our business and how we lay out our business strategies and our investment plans they really are focused on the long-term expectation around energy demand. Doug Terreson : And then also specific to the Company how much of the $1 billion non-cash effect was related to the arbitration ruling with Venezuela and also was this entire amount accounted for in the upstream? Jeff Woodbury : So Doug on the nearly $1 billion about 70% of that was associated with the adjustments to our deferred tax accounting and then about 30% of that is associated with the Venezuela award and that was in the non-U.S. component of the upstream. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : So just to start off on the CapEx side last quarter Exxon indicated that it did not plan to cut its CapEx in 2015 versus its initial target. So I know you\u2019ve given a more broad update at the Analyst Day but just generally speaking has your view changed at all or are you still deciding at this stage and obviously you pulled a buyback lever there so just kind of wondering more broadly how you\u2019re thinking about that? Jeff Woodbury : Sure Phil and I can certainly appreciate a lot of interest given this climate that we are in right now. I\u2019d tell you that right now we have no CapEx guidance but as you may recall we had signaled a further reduction in CapEx to under $37 billion in 2015 as we normally do we\u2019ll provide an update on our -- both our business strategy and our investment plans next month as I indicated. As you are aware we have been reducing our capital spend since 2013 due to several reasons including the completion of several major projects, our ongoing intense focus on capital efficiency and of course our disciplined investment planning given the economic parameters. I guess Phil I\u2019d like to emphasize a couple of points recognizing that I am asking you to hold off until next month. First, regardless of where we are in our business cycle this organization has a very strong culture of driving down our cost structure, whether it be self help in our operating cost or capital efficiency in our project execution. We expect to lead the cost curve in capturing savings especially in downturns like we\u2019re experiencing today. Second, we challenge all of our investments to ensure that we are creating long-term shareholder value through the cycle and remember we are price takers, we don\u2019t assume price growth into the future, but we really focus on those things that we can control like cost, liability and of course our project execution. So Phil we\u2019ll keep a close eye on our cash flow, maintain our investment discipline and of course our commitment to the growing dividend and where necessary we\u2019ll leverage our balance sheet to meet our commitments as appropriate. Phil Gresh : And then a question on the buyback I mean obviously it could have been any number between 0 billion and 3 billion. But just wondering kind of why you specifically picked what you did? Are you trying to kind of target a certain leverage level assuming the strip or just how you\u2019re generally thinking about it and more specifically just kind of wondering what would make you change it up or down from here again? Jeff Woodbury : Sure Phil. Obviously, it\u2019s a number of factors our share of buybacks have always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. The buyback pace has been determined each quarter considering the Company\u2019s current financial position, our CapEx requirements, our dividend requirements, as well as our longer term business outlook and we\u2019ll continue to manage our business in a prudent manner throughout the cycle as we have said many times and that buyback decision will be really an outcome of our cash flow management. So, I\u2019d just again emphasize that we remain committed to our investment program and of course paying our growing dividend. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Jason Smith : Jeff it\u2019s actually Jason Smith on for Doug. Good morning. Just coming back to the one-time items in U.S. refining your earnings looked a little bit weaker than your peers that have reported so far you called out some year-over-year tax and maintenance impacts but it seems like that was not part of your 1 billion, could you maybe give some color around those and maybe quantify the absolute impact for the U.S. and I am just curious if there is anything else going on in U.S. refining beyond that? Jeff Woodbury : Sure. Let me just give you a broad summary on the U.S. refining. Fourth quarter our downstream earnings were impacted by lower realized refining margins and a negative crude lag impact, as well as hard maintenance activities at some of our largest refineries in the Gulf Coast. While earnings were marginally negative over the quarter our full year results were solid at just over $1.5 billion despite the pressure on refining margins and a heavier maintenance year than normal. Overall our U.S. refining footprint is just very well positioned to benefit from advantage feed stocks and from the investments that we have made that focus across a number of areas to further advance our profitability in those assets, such as feedstock flexibility, logistics capability, increasing the higher value product yields and reducing our fundamental cost structure and most important capturing the most value from our integrated business model. Jason Smith : And maybe just on PSC impacts, you\u2019ve gave some color on the sequential improvement I think it was 78,000 barrels a day positive and with oil down significantly from 4Q can you maybe just give any color around the incremental impact that that price is down? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, you can appreciate that each of our contracts are unique and associated with the commercial arrangement. It\u2019d be really tough to give you a rule of thumb because we do have in that category price impacts, you\u2019ve got spend impacts, we have temporary volume impacts that are associated with the fiscal agreements. Broadly speaking you\u2019re correct to assume that lower crude prices will provide an uplift as you saw in the sequential comparison but that impact is largely complicated by the multiple contracts, cost recovery and other effects that we have in our operations. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : My first question maybe CapEx from another angle, net debt is up $7 billion in the quarter I know you reduced the buyback guidance yet, I mean how willing are you to flex the balance sheet through a down cycle maybe discuss limitations on that side which would either take that lower to the buyback lower reduced CapEx? And maybe just lastly on CapEx, I presume you already have a 2015 CapEx number and it\u2019s more of a guidance question or just function how does that work? Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Evan, so I\u2019d get you to think about it from a, it\u2019s fundamental in how manage our cash in the consideration and balance of all the variables that we need to address the inflows, our commitment to fund investment plans as well as our dividend -- I don\u2019t have any specific guidance for you and debt capacity or plans as you know our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding as evidenced by the reductions that we have taken in CapEx and as you have heard the reduction planned in the first quarter on share buybacks. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in our investment approach throughout the cycle but we won\u2019t forego any attractive opportunities. We have a significant debt capacity but we will maintain our financial flexibility and we will assess the cash and our funding options under arrange at outcomes and take a balanced approach to meet those obligations as I indicated. So in short I\u2019ll come back to this message throughout our discussion that we remain committed to investment program that delivers on attractive return but also to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Evan Calio : And maybe second is part of the smaller issue just a question on the quarter, is there an asset sale loss and I missed that which would affect the lower tax rate for the quarter if you can talk me through that please? Jeff Woodbury : So the lower tax rate that you\u2019re focusing on really have three components, one would be the gains on deferred tax items that I mentioned already. The second would be changes to the portfolio mix given the income streams that we get from our U.S. and non-U.S. And then third would be ongoing asset management activities. But I will tell you that Evan that our guidance of our effective tax rate is still consistent or about the mid 40%. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Sankey will Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Just could you update us on what\u2019s going on in Russia from your point of view, if anything and further to that which I know is a JV that was very important to your longer term result and production plan, can you talk about how you would define the attractive opportunities that you\u2019ve mentioned, I assume you\u2019re referring to M&A and whether you\u2019d be more attractive to oil I would assume as opposed to gas reserves more attractive maybe in the new world order to U.S. reserves and maybe within the U.S., if you could set us in a toll about what you would consider and how you would define an attractive opportunity? That would be great, thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Let me starting at Russia, broadly speaking, I mean there is really nothing new to report on that as you all know that sanctions are still in place and we will continue to fully comply. As we said previously that it does not apply to Sakhalin-1 which I\u2019ll just take this opportunity to say that we\u2019ve had extraordinary success really thanks to a very talented organization and a highly effected joint venture. We are very pleased with the successful start-up of our Kutendagi, but in terms of the rest of the business we just need to wait to see how the sanctions play out. I will remind you that ExxonMobil does have a very long standing and successful business in Russia that I\u2019d say is built on an effectively mutually beneficial relationship with our partners. On the second item around attractive opportunities in M&A. Broadly speaking and we've talked previously about our asset management program and you would really think about it on for the full scope of how we have high-grade our portfolios through asset management and that maybe obviously have a ongoing component of divestments of non-strategic or lower value assets but also bringing in through acquisitions some new opportunities. And those maybe bolt on acquisitions, than may be new entries that are synergistic to our business. But Paul we stay very alert to value propositions, we're watchful where we can capture opportunities to high-grade our portfolio whether it be oil, whether it be gas, onshore, offshore. But I will be clear that the real focus here is creating value and we will pursue only those acquisitions that we think that have ultimate strategic value and are accretive to our longer-term returns. Paul Sankey : Yes I guess within that you are primarily interested in long-term reserves, right? I mean obviously you don't want to buy someone's decline curve, so it becomes a question of 2P and 3P I assume? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So Paul if we focus on -- again if we can get synergistic benefits like some of the bolts ons that we have brought into XTO over the last couple of years have been very beneficial. But they do have a very significant component of development potential where we can apply our resource capability expertise and how to develop that, our proprietary technology and our strong balance sheet. But yes we don't want something that's already on decline that doesn't have potential we're really looking for something that really can upgrade our overall portfolio and add future potential. Operator : We will go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake : Just on I am trying to get a sense of again this CapEx question again. How much of your say upstream spends is kind of locked in for 2015 and how much wiggle room do you have in 2016 I appreciate this maybe something for the Analyst Day but just trying to get a sense of the levers that you could pull if your revenues are much lower this year? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, sure. I would tell you that as we look at our overall investment program, we've been -- we focus on every asset that we have got regardless of whether it's as you have indicated a longer-term investment which is quite frankly a core component of our investment program as well as the shorter cycle investments and study work, nothing is really sacred in there. But as I indicated we have very strong culture of driving those cost structures down, we have been very actively engaged with our service providers and we fully expect to capture savings in across the spectrum of our business from rig rates to labor and services as well as commodities. But I would be clear Ed that we're probably in the very early innings of this effort. There is a lot of strong reaction to the current price business climate and we think that with that it presents a number of really good opportunities to capture incremental savings, lower the overall cost structure of the business as well as position us with some other opportunities as we go forward. The thing that I would really point out that distinguishes us is that as we've said many times is that we can invest through the business cycle and it presents some opportunities that we will able to lower that cost structure and prove our overall longer-term returns given the financial capability that we have. Ed Westlake : And then a quick quarter question. Asia natural gas production and Australasia as well down ticked in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter I appreciate there is lots of different demand drivers across a big business, but is there anything specific you would call out for that step down? Jeff Woodbury : I would say that a component of that had to do with demand in Australia but remember that there was a very healthy increase associated with Papua New Guinea over the year sequentially you don't see as much of an increase there was a slight increase in Papua New Guinea though. Ed Westlake : But in Asia there was well say a much larger business but that was also down generally? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, it was generally at some facility performance downtime. Operator : .: Blake Fernandez : The first question in terms of Venezuela I know you mentioned the arbitration ruling, can you just kind of confirm that that finalizes this process or is there any additional legs to kind of move forward on there? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Blake on Venezuela, there is actually two separate arbitration proceedings one was International Chamber of Commerce that I mentioned that we recognized the award on. The second was the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes. What we recognized was the first one I will note that both of those decisions did confirm that the Venezuela government failed to provide fair compensation for the assets that were expropriated. We will recognize the second ruling at the time that we receive payment and when all legal proceedings have concluded. Blake Fernandez : I hope this doesn't get too in the weeds but the second question is on the impact of the strong U.S. dollar. I am just curious if you could talk around how that's impacting your business with the rapid moves we've seen and may be what's then embedded in the quarter, as a result of FX? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, in terms of ForEx, as you are probably very aware that it has offset impacts across our business in the upstream, it primarily ends up being a margin benefit due to local denominated OpEx whereas in the chemical and downstream, it tends to have a negative impact due to our dollar denominated crude payables. So, in quarter-on-quarter it was a slight hurt to earnings of under $50 million although sequentially, it actually was a positive of over $200 million. Operator : We will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : I was wondering, if you could just go through Exxon's current thoughts on the global LNG market, you have several potential projects that haven\u2019t FID\u2019d yet, you think may be the global market needs to take a pause at this point? Jeff Woodbury : Well Brad, again as we talked a little earlier, our investment plans are really founded on our outlook for supply and demand. We still, as I said projected gas demand to grow about 1.6% per year to now in 2014 and that really provides the business case for our LNG projects. Broadly speaking our existing LNG facilities are a key component of our portfolio, very important part of our margin generation. As we see demand grow in the future we expect supply will grow in line with that demand. Obviously these are capital-intensive projects so we'll need to ensure there is a sufficient price structure in place to underpin those investments. We have gotten a number of projects across the globe that are in place. They are positioned to go ahead and compete for that demand profile. Brad Heffern : And just thinking about gas in a different way, certainly in the U.S. you've been somewhat minimizing gas drilling over the past couple of years and the market certainly has its own challenges right now but has the downturn in oil caused you to think any different way about, what's specifically your drilling for in the U.S.? Jeff Woodbury : Not really, I would tell you that, it's still based on our demand projections we've got significant drillable gas potential within the U.S. and as you know this, generally a short cycle type investment. We can get on capacity pretty quick. So, we are very well positioned to do that, should the demand grow and the prices support it. I would also say that from a chemical perspective, our chemical business is very well positioned to take advantage of the lower commodity prices. Particularly in U.S. our manufacturing sites are highly flexible and can run across a wide range of feedstocks, from ethane all the way to gas oil. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thank you. I actually got a follow-on to both the questions that were just asked, just in terms of how you are managing the lower 48 business in the pricing downturn Jeff, are you keeping a relatively steady rig count or have you being laying down rigs the way that the rest of the industry has as well. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, well that's a good question Jason. I\u2019d cast it from a -- if you will a historical perspective that, we've taken a very measured pace in how we've developed our lower 48 unconventional resources. You did see over 2014 a number of operators really ramp-up their rig counts significantly, we did grow our rig count and in fact, we are up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter but at a very measured pace to make sure that we didn't outrun our headlights. We wanted to makes sure that we had a good understanding of the resource performance and importantly, we wanted to make sure that we are fully integrating all the earnings back into our advanced program. So, we've been very measured, how we've moved forward going forward we'll consider all the factors, including the business condition, infrastructure capability as well as our demand projections. But going forward, we've got, I just want to reinforce that we do have a very robust inventory of opportunities even in this price environment. Jason Gammel : And my second question is on the LNG business. Can you remind us how much just as a percentage of your overall LNG output is committed under long term contracts and how much is actually put into the spot market. And then on the spot market, are you seeing significant demand weakness that potentially would even lead to reducing sold utilization? Jeff Woodbury : So on the LNG business, I'd say that a majority of our LNG or current LNG is under long term contracts, very few that have spot sales. Of course we did take some spot sales with Papua New Guinea, given the early startup. And also note that in our LNG contracts we have potential to divert cargos as well, which gives a lot of flexibility. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Asit Sen with Cowen and Company. Asit Sen : Two unrelated questions. First on the issue of supply chain cost and your prior success with that. I was wondering if you could quantify annual third partly cause globally for the organization. Some of your peers have highlighted multibillion dollar opportunities for this reduction. And also any high level thoughts on recently announced oil service industry consolidation? Has anything changed on the ground for Exxon? Jeff Woodbury : Broadly speaking -- I don\u2019t have specific numbers. As I said previously we are as a mainstay in how we manage our business. We\u2019re constantly working on that cost structure. We are very active with our service providers. As I indicated we\u2019re probably in the early innings of that. We\u2019ve seen -- we are seeing decreases in rig rates and labor and service costs as well as starting to see some commodity changes as well. But watch that space. More is to come in that area. On the second question, remind me? I said, was there\u2026 Asit Sen : And on the oil service industry consolidation, any thoughts on that or things have changed? Jeff Woodbury : No, there is really nothing I have to say on that. We access all the service providers and competition is good and we have a very strict standard on what we expect from in terms of quality, performance and service costs. Asit Sen : And just my follow up is on U.S. onshore. Last quarter you had highlighted that Bakken was Exxon\u2019s most active and conventional play with I think 13 rigs running. Could you update us on activity levels currently, and perhaps provide update on Woodford and Permian as well? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, so across the three main liquid plays that we\u2019ve got, we\u2019re producing in excess of 220,000 barrels a day gross and we\u2019re running currently about 44 rigs. I\u2019d say we\u2019re active in all three of them. That rig count has if you compare back to what I said last quarter has increased but very-very encouraging list of opportunities and we\u2019re making great success in integrating our learnings and driving down the cost curve. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng : Two quick questions. I don\u2019t know whether you have any number you can share. In your prior calls when we\u2019re looking at the contract, is there a number you can share in terms of the send, maybe for the contract is over two years, still remaining? In other words I'm trying to understand that what is the percent of your supply cost that if we do see a substantial deflation in the industry cost structure, it's going to see a rapidly quick pass flow into you? Jeff Woodbury : Paul, I don\u2019t think I have any guidance on that. Paul Cheng : Okay. And secondly that -- you\u2019re saying that in the downstream you have a crude lag purchase. In fact that is negative? Jeff Woodbury : That\u2019s correct. Paul Cheng : Can you quantify how big is that? Jeff Woodbury : Well, broadly speaking from a crude lag -- I want to be clear Paul. When we see a decrease in prices like we\u2019re seeing right now, we have a negative crude lag effect. In the fourth quarter absolute it was just over $600 million. And likewise in an environment where price is increasing you\u2019d have the opposite effect. Paul Cheng : Do you think the -- nice [ph] oil economy, so why we have such a big negative crude effect? And also that I thought the price finalization were made to your Saudi contract in a declining oil price environment. So it\u2019d actually be a favorable positive impact. So I get that. I'm just totally wrong on that then? Jeff Woodbury : So the crude lag effect is primarily associated with pipeline supply contracts standard terms to how the pricing is done. Paul Cheng : Okay. Can you speak also -- this 600 primarily in U.S. then, I presume? Jeff Woodbury : That\u2019s correct. Paul Cheng : And that -- is there any other tax impact in the quarter other than say the $700 million U.S. deferred tax in the upstream? Jeff Woodbury : Paul is your question relating to our overall performance or specific to a segment? Paul Cheng : Yes, you can say looking at all the other segment that we know that you have $700 million of the U.S. tax benefit in the upstream. Is there any other tax negative impact or positive impact in the other segment? Jeff Woodbury : That is an essence the most of it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Allen Good with Morningstar. Allen Good : Maybe if I could tackle the cost improvement question from a different angle. Is there any area that Exxon has identified based off trends of the past two years, where you think you may have more opportunity to cut cost relative to other areas. And I guess I'm thinking more along the lines of project type and in specific regions relative to the other ones? Jeff Woodbury : I think broadly speaking -- we always feel like we\u2019ve got opportunity to become cost efficient. From a capital prospective, it\u2019s around upfront planning for execution, to make sure that we\u2019re most effective in utilization of services as well as commodities. In terms of our day to day operations, our fuel costs are big a component. You have to manage that appropriately. In terms of energy efficiency of your facilities. As I commented on the capital program, I\u2019d say that nothing is really sacred. We continue to identify additional opportunities to make our cost structure more efficient. Allen Good : And then on asset sales, I would assume that you guys are more opportunistic on that level and I think you probably recall -- you said the approach of the -- if it's worth more to us or more to the buyer, we'll sell. And could you give me around your asset release interest that you may have you may have seen six months ago declined into today and should we expect maybe the asset sale slowdown over the next year to 18 months? Jeff Woodbury : We\u2019ve got such diverse portfolio of assets, I really couldn\u2019t characterize for you whether time -- the interest is increased or decreased. Assets are so unique in their own right, and recognize that we're -- these are years of planning to assess when the right time is to go ahead and monetize that asset in a different means. We\u2019ve been very successful in capturing incremental value from our assets that we don\u2019t believe longer has a strategic fit for business. So I\u2019d leave at that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank Ryan Todd : Maybe one follow-up question on U.S. liquids production. It was quite strong in the quarter -- strong sequentially and strong year-on-year. Can you talk a little bit about what assets are primarily driving that growth? Is this kind of your big three onshore plays that you are talking about or is it a little bit of everything? Jeff Woodbury : So this is a good opportunity to really talk more about it. In terms of our fourth quarter versus the third quarter performance, we\u2019re up quite significantly on our volumes primarily driven by our projects. Quarter-on-quarter projects are up about 130,000 oil equivalents barrels per day. Those volumes are coming from Angola, primarily the Coak [ph] project, in Canada associated with the Kearl project in Papua New Guinea, associated with our LNG project. We had an increase in project volume associated with Malaysia to Loakim [ph] and Damar, as well as we had a very nice build in our U.S. work program due to our active drilling program in the three main liquid plays. The other thing I'd point out is that we've also made great progress. The team has done an outstanding job in reducing our downtime in our facilities. 2014 was a very successful year, and that brings very high value volume to the bottom line. Ryan Todd : And then maybe one more LNG. I guess a couple of quotes on LNG which is -- is there any risk to the pricing in terms of your exiting LNG contracts in the current environment from periodic reopeners in the contracts? And would a longer duration of this moderate environment change the pace or effort at all around U.S. LNG exports? Jeff Woodbury : No, again these are very large capital intensive projects. The investment is underpinned by our long term gas demand projection and that's really the business case. As I've said earlier our existing LNG projects are a very significant part of our margin generation. Operator : We will take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Just maybe follow-up on a couple of things that have been hit here already. But as you look at the major projects that you outlined in the earlier presentation, just curious what the sort of incremental '15 impact is? A lot of these projects started at the end of '14 and roll into '15. If you could give us an idea of maybe the volumes impact there? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, so for our 2014 program, just to recap, we added about 250,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. As we look forward for 2015, we will need to provide you an update at the March Analyst Meeting. Roger Read : Well I guess I was just wondering for the ones that were highlighted in the presentation, or we just -- it's the March event, we'll wait for that I guess is? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, for 2015 -- I shared with you how those investments in the presentation will ramp up to their peak production. As I said Arkutun-Dagi ramping up to 90,000 barrels a day, Nabiye ramping up to 40,000 barrels a day, Hadrian South ramping up 3,00 million cubic feet per day. Beyond that we'll be more specific in next month's Analyst Presentation to have a discussion about it. Roger Read : Okay. And then earlier in some of the Q&A, you had mentioned specific to dealing with the cost structure and it sounded like to me both internally and your third parties. Any comparisons contracts you can do with previous downturns in terms of contracts that you have fixed here? An another way of asking the question, any change in the flexibility Exxon has to address the cost structure today versus several years ago, or in prior downturns we've had? Jeff Woodbury : No I wouldn't highlight anything that's changed. As I've said a couple of times, it's a very intense focus on capital efficiency and lowering our cost structure in our business across the areas that I talked about previously. Roger Read : So no particulars on rig contracts or anything like that that, that are more onerous than prior times? Jeff Woodbury : No. And I don't want to get into the specifics on our commercial arrangements, but we've got a very large sizable operation and that positions us well to go ahead and work with our providers to put in place a very effective cost structure. Operator : . : Ian Reid : Jeff, just got a question on your pre-sanctioned pre-FID projects. A couple of your partners have been talking about pushing these out due to carrying some cost pressures and waiting for lower service cost et cetera. Specifically thinking about projects such as Tangese and some of the Austrilasian and Canadian R&D projects, is that something which you're also kind of factoring into with your longer-term production and your CapEx outlook in terms of pushing these kind of more marginal projects down the road a little bit? Jeff Woodbury : Well, it'd be a consideration. Broadly speaking we've got a very large and diverse inventory of opportunities. We are very careful as we move these things forward, that one, not only have they reached technical maturity, but that we have tested the economic viability across a full range of economic parameters, including commodity price. So while we don't forecast a -- or expect a price growth in order to make these investments go forward, we want to make sure that we go into this eyes wide open and that we have a good handle on how robust these investments are. So when we do have these commodities -- volatilities like we're seeing right now, we're comfortable about the investment plans that we have in place. Quite frankly our investment program is really driven by a long-term projection and we just don't overreact to volatility in the market. But we're mindful. We're mindful about implications on the business climate, implications on our cash flow management and then the overall supply demand projection. So all of those variables are considered in how we set up our investment plans, but given that it's based on a long-term projection of demand, and they have been tested across a range of economic parameters, there won't be a whole lot of change. I'm not suggesting that there will be no change, but there won't be a whole lot of change to our investment plans. Ian Reid : Okay, all right, that's understood. Can I just ask a quick question on chemicals? Your numbers there seem to be holding up pretty well. I'm just wondering what you are thinking about chemical demand, in particular outside of the U.S going forward, because you're going to be seeing very much lower in [indiscernible] prices now. So what do you feel about the kind of pricing and demand side of that business? Jeff Woodbury : Very well positioned. It's a great business. We've got the chemical facilities positioned throughout in North America. We're benefiting from the lower feed costs. We've got advantaged assets there in the Europe and Asia Pacific, our steam crackers really benefit from the lower price environment we're in right now. Particularly our newest cracker in Singapore, which can process an unprecedented range of feedstocks, ranging from crude oil, including crude oil, which is the -- really an industry first. Ian Reid : Yes, I am just wondering about how the industry dynamic you're seeing out there in terms of demand and pricing -- I know you're well positioned but what are you seeing in terms of Asian demand, European demand. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Ian, our global demand is expected -- based on our assessment it's expected to grow above GDP, driven by Asia. Operator : We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Can you just come back to the deferred tax benefits and just explain what's going on? A comment please? Jeff Woodbury : Yes so, we periodically will review our deferred tax accounts to make sure that we've got the right reserves in place, and sometimes that results in an adjustments which you're seeing this quarter. Alastair Syme : It's not related to commodity prices in anyway? Jeff Woodbury : No, it's just a prudent review of our deferred tax accounts. Alastair Syme : Okay. And my second question -- some people have eluded to that -- this is the lag effect on pricing. If could just discuss on LNG, what the typical lag effect is and how -- when do you think we'll see bottom prices, given where oil prices are today? Jeff Woodbury : Well, there is a crude lag effect on our LNG contracts. We're going to discuss the specifics of those. So you will see some impacts going forward. It really does vary by contract. Alastair Syme : Okay, but it's sometime the first and second quarter, will be reasonable even? Jeff Woodbury : Well, it depends on what prices do. Operator : We'll take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : First on the balance sheet, is it still the case that you are targeting maintaining AAA credit rating? And if so, how much debt do you think you can take on and still keep the AAA? Jeff Woodbury : Yes so as I said earlier Paul, we don't have any specific guidance on debt capacity or our plans. We will asses our cash and funding options around a range of outcomes and we'll take a balanced approach to meet our obligations. But as I indicated, we have significant debt capacity, but importantly we'll maintain our financial flexibility. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. In relation to your top three U.S. liquids play, if you said that the rig count has actually increased from three months ago, can you name any geographic areas, either North America or otherwise, where the rig count has dropped in the last three months? Jeff Woodbury : Well, I'd just say broadly speaking at the level that we'll share with you all, our overall rig count globally is running just under 100 rigs. About 60% of that is in the U.S. and we continue to assess the value proposition of maintaining a rig activity. I'll leave it at that there. Operator : We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Guy Baber : You highlighted the improvement to your underlying upstream margins through 2014 despite a lower year-on-year commodity pricing environment, which you all have been very focused on for some time and I think was a very important accomplishment for you guys. Setting aside the commodity -- as we look to 2015, I was just hoping you could comment on just bigger picture expectations for the trend in underlying upstream margins and what do you think perhaps the biggest drivers and biggest opportunities may be. And I'm thinking evolution of maybe project mix and ramp ups, costs, or focused portfolio moves, just wondering if there is anything specific you could share there that we should be focusing on? And then I had a quick follow up. Jeff Woodbury : Good question Guy. I'd say I appreciate the recognition of the progress that we've made over 2014. And I'd say that, that's a result of several factors. One is this intense focus on capital efficiency and lowering our cost structure too has been the higher margin production that we've been adding to the portfolio due to our major project activity and our U.S. onshore drilling activity, predominantly in the three main liquid plays that we've talked. Both have been a significant uptick to our overall unit profitability. Guy Baber : That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow up was with 2014 now on the books, I was just wondering if there is any update you could share on base portfolio decline, how that performed versus expectations? And then big picture, did Exxon expect an increase in global decline rates just for the industry, given some base spending that\u2019s perhaps being cut? And then is that an important component of your oil price, kind of fundamental outlook? Jeff Woodbury : So our overall base decline in 2014 was about 3%. We have continued to offset that with our work program activity as well as the major project adds. Obviously in our unconventional you see a higher decline rate earlier on and then it flattens out and that will have an impact and we offset that with a very active work program. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Paul Cheung with Barclays. Paul Cheung : Just two very quick follow up. Do you have underlip or overlip in the quarter for your upstream production versus the sales versus the production? Jeff Woodbury : So the overlipped and underlipped we have a -- my recollection was that we did have an underlip in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. Paul Cheung : How about that versus the actual production? Jeff Woodbury : Well, that\u2019s what it is. Underlip versus the production. Paul Cheung : Do you have -- can you quantify what is that number? Jeff Woodbury : Sequentially it was about 90,000 barrels. Paul Cheung : Okay, and\u2026 Jeff Woodbury : Paul, I'd just highlight though, while we see that variability on a quarter to quarter basis, I\u2019ll just note that it was essentially flat year-on-year. Paul Cheung : And that do you have -- and I think that -- very little asset sales. Just wondering is there any asset sales gain in the quarter? Jeff Woodbury : For the quarter on the asset sales, it was very small, Paul. It had some small upstream assets in the fourth quarter and very small downstream as well. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions at this time. Jeff Woodbury : To conclude, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for your time and your questions this morning. As you know our business model is designed to be successful in a business climate known for commodity price volatility, and that\u2019s really why it always comes back to the fundamentals. Prudent cash management, operational reliability and efficiency, there's intense cost control. I talked about it a couple of times and obviously excellence in project execution. And we really do look forward to sharing more with you in March with an update on our business strategies and our investment plans. So until then everybody take care and we\u2019ll see you in March. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site. So before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. ExxonMobil delivered earnings of $4.9 billion. These solid financial results demonstrate the value of our integrated business in a lower commodity price environment. Regardless of our current market conditions we remain focused on business fundamentals and competitive advantages that create long-term shareholder value. Upstream production volumes were more than 2% higher compared to year ago quarter, benefiting from new developments in Papua New Guinea, Canada, Angola, Indonesia and U.S. onshore liquids plays. ExxonMobil's downstream and chemical businesses had strong performance across all regions driven by lower feedstock costs and improved demand, coupled with our competitive product and asset mix. Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results, global economic growth continue to moderate in the first quarter of 2015. U.S. growth slowed relative to the fourth quarter where as China's economy decelerated further and growth in Europe and Japan remain weak. However there are recent indications that growth maybe improving particularly in Europe. As you know energy prices continued to decline in the quarter, leading the lower cost to supply in the downstream and stronger global refinery margins on hard demand. Meanwhile chemical gas cracking margins softened on lower product realizations but remain advantage relative to liquids cracking. Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings were $4.9 billion, which represents $1.17 per share. The corporation distributed $3.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter to dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding and of that total $1 billion, was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.7 billion which is in line with our plan. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $5.2 billion and debt was $32.8 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased from $4.7 to $5.2 billion. Earnings adjust per depreciation expense changes in working capital and other items in our ongoing asset management program yielded $8.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Users included net investments in the business of $6.8 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.9 billion, debt and other financing increased cash by $2.7 billion. Yesterday, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share a 5.8% increase from the last quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to remain at $1 billion in the second quarter of 2015. Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings of $4.9 billion were $4.2 billion, lower than the year ago quarter. Lower upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger downstream results. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $1.6 billion, as lower upstream and chemical earnings were partly offset by stronger downstream results. Guidance on corporate and financing expenses remain at $500 million to $700 million per quarter. Turning now to upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9. Upstream earnings in the first quarter were $2.9 billion, down $4.9 billion from the first quarter of 2014. As you can see slightly lower realizations decreased earnings by $5.5 billion where crude declined by almost $54 per barrel and gas was down more than $2.60 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $340 million, driven by growth from new developments. All other items added another $250 million primarily due to favorable tax effects. Moving now to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 97,000 barrels per day or 2.3% compared to the first quarter of last year. Liquids production increased to 129,000 barrels per day or 6%, benefitting from new projects, work programs and favorable entitlement impacts partly offset by maintenance activities. Natural gas production decreased to 188 million cubic feet per day or 1.6%. Field decline and divestment impacts were partly offset by volume adds for Papua New Guinea and LNG in higher entitlements. Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, upstream earnings were $2.6 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $2.4 billion as crude declined almost $22 per barrel and gas decreased more than a $1.20 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $260 million driven by a higher LNG facility utilization, entitlement impacts and growth from new developments. All other items reduced earnings by $500 million reflecting lower benefits from tax items in absence of the Venezuela ICC award, partly offset by lower operating costs. Now moving to Slide 12, sequentially volumes were up 194,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 4.8%. Liquids production increased 95,000 barrels per day, on new project growth and entitlement effects partly offset by fuel decline. Natural gas production was up $594 million cubic feet per day driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe and higher LNG facility utilization partly offset by fuel decline. Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.7 billion an increase of $854 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. Higher refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $1 billion, positive volume and mix effects added another $70 million and all other items decreased earnings by $260 million including higher maintenance activities and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Now turning to Slide 14, sequentially first quarter downstream earnings were up $1.2 billion, stronger global refining margins increased earnings by $900 million while unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $70 million. All other items added $340 million primarily from lower expenses and maintenance activities. Moving now to the chemical financial operating results starting on Slide15. First quarter chemical earnings were $982 million down $65 million versus the prior year quarter. Higher margins on lower feed stock and energy costs increased earnings by $240 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added another $30 million and all other items reduced earnings by $340 million mainly due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Moving now to Slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings decreased by $245 million on lower commodity product margins. Positive volume and mix effects were more than offset by other impacts. Moving next to the first quarter business highlights beginning on Slide 17. In our upstream business we continue to pursue attractive investments to commercialize our unparalleled resource base. As discussed during our recent analyst meeting 2015 will be yet another active year for new developments including seven major project start ups which will add another 300,000 barrels of oil per day to working interest capacity. We reached several milestones over the last few months starting in Canada first pitchman production was achieved from the Cold Lake, Nabiye expansion which was completed on schedule and on budget. Nabiye produced 12,000 barrels per day in March with volumes expected to increase to a peak of more than 40,000 barrels per day by year end. Over it's expected 30 year life span Nabiye will develop 280 million barrels of recoverable reserves. In the Gulf of Mexico we initiated production from the Hadrian South subsea development in late March. And I highlight that one of the Hadrian wells recently tested at 200 million cubic feet of gas per day representing one of the highest production rates on record in the Gulf of Mexico. Daily gross production from Hadrian South is expected to reach approximately 300 million cubic feet of gas and 3,000 barrels of liquids from two wells. In Angola block 15 we successfully started up Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 project notably ahead of schedule and below budget. This capital efficient project is a subsea development tied back to the existing Kisomba B and Mondo FPSOs and leverages available always for processing storage and off loading. Project development were 190 million barrels from three fields and gross production is expected to reach 70,000 barrels of oil per day helping to boost total block 15 production to 350,000 barrels per day. In Asia the Banyu Europe development is more than 96% complete in commissioning activities are well underway. The project's crude transport system which includes on shore and off shore pipelines connected to a floating storage and off loading vessel has been installed and first lifting in April. To implementation of early production concepts Banyu Europe is now producing 75,000 barrels of oil per day growth. Early strong well performance enables continued use of existing early production facilities along with the ramp up of the central processing plant. We expect to reach peak field production of more than 200,000 barrels per day by year-end. The Kearl expansion projects in Canada continues to progress ahead of schedule. All major construction activities are now complete and are focus has shifted to commissioning and pre-start up activities. Facilities start up is now expected by mid year. So with respect to our exploration program we continue to pursue a diverse set of opportunities. In Romania additional drilling is ongoing in the deep water Neptune block and data collected from these wells are being integrated into development planning for the area. Drilling operations in the Kurdistan region of Iraq are continuing and we drilled and tested the Pirmam well and are evaluating these results additional drilling is planned in the next several months. And then offshore Guyana, we are drilling the Liza wildcat which is the country's first deepwater well. Lastly in the Gulf of Mexico we were the apparent high bidder on 11 new exploration blocks in lease sale 235 further strengthening our acreage position. The plan to utilize our advance seismic imaging capability to enhance opportunity evaluation on these blocks. Turning now to Slide 18 and an update on our downstream investments which further strengthen our advantage portfolio. Here again during the quarter we achieved several milestones. We completed the lube basestock facility expansions at our refineries in Singapore and in Baytown Texas building on ExxonMobil's leading technology and our worldwide manufacturing footprint. These investments will help supply high performance lube basestocks to meet global demand growth. In Canada commissioning is underway at the Edmonton Rail Terminal a 50-50 joint venture in Imperial Oil and Kinder Morgan. The terminal will have a capacity of 210,000 barrels per day and will provide logistics flexibility to support efficient cost effective market access for our grown Canadian oils sands production. This facility will also enable us to deliver additional advantage crude to our refinery system. Ramp up of loading activities is expected over the next few months. Finally we also continue to extend our operating cost advantage by improving energy efficiency of our facilities. We have recently funded and started construction of a new 84 megawatt cogeneration plant at our Singapore refinery which will enable to shutdown of less efficient power generation facilities and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Upon start up the unit will add to our total 5.5 gigawatts of gross cogeneration capacity around the world. And this is another example of ExxonMobil's commitment to optimize manufacturing operations, improve energy efficiency and to reduce both environmental impacts and operating costs. So in conclusion ExxonMobil's results underscore our continued focus on business fundamentals and our competitive advantages regardless of market conditions. In the first quarter the corporation earned $4.9 billion demonstrating the value of our integrated businesses in a lower commodity price environment. In the upstream we increased production from new developments while in the downstream in chemical segments delivered strong results across all regions. Resulting cash flow from operations and asset sales were $8.5 billion generating positive free cash flow which highlights our disciplined capital allocation approach. Corporation distributed $3.9 billion to shareholders and we remain dedicated to creating shareholder value through the cycle. Now that concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions]. We will go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : I will try two if I may. The first one is on the, I wonder about expression the upstream capture rate specifically I'm looking at the very strong international gas prices this quarter, which seem to hold up a lot better relative to the oil benchmarks and I guess the mix significant of there are lot of moving parts obviously but the mix also saw you as gas production decline. So I'm wondering if you can just help those two specific issues on what\u2019s going on with the margin and whether you expect that strength to continue. And I've got a follow-up, please. Jeff Woodbury : Doug we generally don't provide forward guidance on the commodity prices. In the first quarter our total gas realizations were about $6.11 and as you know that\u2019s a combination of our flowing gas as well as our LNG sales, and those LNG contracts have mixed fiscal terms that will in many cases are benchmark to liquid prices, obviously some type of lag affect associated with the market conditions. Doug Leggate : So the strong European gases or international gas driver is really more of a lag effect, how should we think about it? Jeff Woodbury : Well I think it from a LNG perspective, if you remember from our prior discussions it is a very significant part of our portfolio, and we've been adding significant liquids linked volumes over the years, and certainly is a factor for how our realization will change overtime. Doug Leggate : I will maybe try and follow-up one offline to get into details. But my follow-up is maybe a little aspirational in terms of whether you will answer or not, but at our conference in November you -- and I guess multiple times since you guys have described Exxon as positioned for this type of environment, as it relates to M&A. Obviously we've seen one very large transaction already. I am just curious if you could kind of qualify how you see the market in light of that comment and specifically for the Mozambique LNG is on your radar given that you've held an advisory there with the government over in recent years, and I'll leave it at that. Jeff Woodbury : As we've discussed previously think about it more broadly as asset management which is a key component of our ongoing business, and we regularly assess our portfolio for higher value opportunities throughout the cycle. And as you have seen in our financial results that includes an ongoing program of marketing assets where we believe they have greater value to others, but likewise we keep very alert to opportunities on the horizon per acquisitions, and that maybe bolt-on acquisitions as I said in the past that provide natural synergies to existing operations that we can capture incremental value from or larger acquisitions that fundamentally will provide strategic value for us in the long-term as you know, we're not going to signal specifics as to what our intentions are but we keep very much alert to maybe opportunities for additional shareholder value. I'll remind you that, given that financial strength that we have -- we can invest through our cycle, including in resource development opportunities, investments in our manufacturing business as well as potential acquisition targets. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : On the quarter itself it looks like production was little higher than what we were expecting some of that was the PSEs but I think some of that was the underlying projects here. And as I think about Angola, Gulf of Mexico starting up, you've got some ramp towards the backend of the year as well. So I'm just curious as we think about the balance for the year, could there be some upside to the base case production guidance or are we not thinking about of the turnarounds. Anything you can do to provide some color on shape of production over the course of the year would be very helpful. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, so just from a production standpoint, I'd tell you that our guidance that we provided in the analyst meeting last month remains the same about 4.1 million barrels per day. We started the year very strongly as you highlighted we added significant volumes with a quarter-over-quarter or sequentially associate with the new projects that we've brought on which as you appropriately pointed out or continue to ramp up. As I said in my prepared comments, we've got seven new major projects starting up throughout the year and this is part of our significant investment program that we had implemented several years ago that's where our CapEx peak up several years ago, as we wanted to progress these mature assets to capture long-term value and we're seeing the benefits of it today. Important in all that Neil is not only new projects but our continued focus on the base making sure that we've stronger liability and we're continue to integrate our learnings into productivity improvements. Neil Mehta : And then if you could comment on two kind a top of minder news topical subjects here. The first would be any comments around Exxon Torrance and how we should be thinking about the ESP and timing there? And the second as relates to Russia, which I know you've spend lot of time and how we should be thinking about the impact assumptions on longer term growth from those operations? Jeff Woodbury : Sure, Neil. On Torrance just to benefit of the group, the Torrance refinery in February experienced an incident which resulted in the damage to the electrostatic precipitator, and I'll say up front that we certainly do regret the incident and -- obviously going to be very diligent and understanding what the issues were what earnings we can take from it and how do we incorporate that into our global business? But this precipitator is a mission control device that removes fine particles from exhaust gas. There are several investigations underway both the state and federal level. Neil at this time, we really can't estimate when the investigations will be completed and when the site may return to full operations. As I indicated, we have our own investigation that's in progress. I'll say that we are diligently working to ensure a continued supply to our customers, some of the units at the refinery are operational and we're producing both gasoline and distillates, but we continue to evaluate in parallel with the investigations continue to evaluate options to reinstate our capacity there. With respect to Russia, broadly speaking there is really nothing new to report at this point as you know the sanctions remain in place and we will continue to fully comply -- I don't want to speculate when those sanctions will conclude but I'll remind you that they do not include or soften one operation which recently we're very pleased with the successful start of the third field our Arkutun-Dagi. And also say that we have had a longstanding and successful business in Russia that's really built on our effective and I think mutually beneficial rate relationship with our Russian partner. I guess the other point I'd leave you with is that we have a very diversified portfolio with Russia just being part of that and it provides great opportunities for us to continue to grow shareholder value over the years. Operator : We will go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Guy Baber : I was hoping you could discuss Kearl performance, a bit his quarter. It looks like some significant improvement relative to where it ran last year and if you get of actually approach max rate there for the quarter. So could you talk about what you're seeing there and then could you also address confidence levels in a quick sustainable ramp up for the Kearl expansion. I mean what that timeline looks like and some of the benefits of applying learning from some of the struggles with ramping up Kearl 1. Jeff Woodbury : I appreciate the question. As we've said in the past Kearl is an advantage long life asset, one that has significant future potential as you look at, how we further optimize the base. As you highlight we have continued to improve on our reliability towards our operating targets and we\u2019re fairly consistently producing at the 110,000 barrels a day growth. We are a bit short of that in the first quarter given some plant maintenance that we took but nonetheless it's important to say that we\u2019re achieving higher rates, we've implemented some facility enhancement opportunities, and we expect to see better reliability going forward. As I said in my prepared comments, the expansion is progressing ahead of schedule, when that expansion comes on we will get further economies of scale with the full operation. And as I have said previously we\u2019re fully integrating the learnings from the initial development into the expansion real-time such that we will expect to see better ramp up on the expansion versus the initial development. I would also highlight a couple of other things, first that we\u2019re making additional investments to maximize logistics flexibility and as I mentioned in my prepared comments the Edmonton Rail Terminal is going to provide additional flexibility. And that takes to my second point, that it really is fully integrated with our manufacturing business and we\u2019re capturing integration value throughout if you will the full value chain from upstream, downstream in our chemicals business. Guy Baber : Also I was hoping to get a general comment on what you all are seeing on the capital spending front, when it comes to securing cost reductions and managing the CapEx according to the internal plan. It looks like it's tracking well to start the year from advantage point and more specifically the upstream non-U.S. spending was the lowest this quarter, it's been since 2009 I believe. So could you just talk about that a little bit, and is that just reflective of major project phasing or is there been perhaps some significant cuts to the international CapEx and areas that are little bit less visible perhaps to the base or elsewhere that you can talk about? Jeff Woodbury : So let me take your first question in the broadest concept and as we talked previously regardless of where we\u2019re in the business cycle the organization stays very focused on driving down that cost structure whether it be in operating cost or a focus on capital efficiency in our major projects. Across our spend we\u2019re actively engaged with the various service providers and we\u2019re making some really good progress in capturing those savings from raw materials to services to our rig rates to our just fundamentally our construction costs. I will highlight just make a point that we have a very effective global procurement organization that is focused on capturing the lowest lifecycle cost, and I think it really does advantage us from managing that from a global perspective. I think it's also worth noting that our efforts go well beyond just trying to reduce cost from our service providers as we do think such as continuing to integrate our learning curve benefits into our designs and execution plans, I've shared with you in my response to prior question that real-time we've been able to integrate our learnings in the Kearl initial development into the expansion project. We continue to enhance our set of opportunities including through commercial terms as well optimizing our development plans and we continue to leverage what I'd say as the collective ingenuity between our service providers and our own people in identifying and pursuing more cost effective solutions. And I'll note that given our financial capability we\u2019re able to accelerate equipment and commodity purchases in the softer market, which I think provides a real cost advantage to our project portfolio. Today since the price decline I would say that the drilling and related services have been most responsive to the current market and we've captured about an incremental 20% reduction in our well cost from the lower 48 to unconventional place in terms of our spend level. I would tell you that there is no new guidance. We've signaled $34 billion target for 2015, we are making good progress and capturing the savings as I said that was incorporated into that spend level. But this organization tends to over perform and I expect that we'll see further savings beyond what we had envisioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : So over the macro maybe another aspirational question. Excellent touches more barrels than any U.S. producer any refiner for that matter. Any color on demand trends you are seeing or is there broadly any change or shift in the longer commodity down cycle view that was spoused at the spring Analyst Day? Jeff Woodbury : Evan let me see if -- I just give you some thoughts on a broader picture. Currently we'll range in anywhere from the 1.5 to 2 million barrels a day over supply. General feeling is that as you get into the second half we'll see more conversions towards a balance supply demand. But as we all know there was a significant inventory build in 2014 due to the oversupply and that is continued year-to-date. And that storage will need -- that storage overhang will need to be or top overtime. While we may converge in the second half of the year, I'd tell you that there is still a lot unknowns and one of them being is how the unconventional production levels in the U.S will trend over time despite the fact that we\u2019ve seen significant reductions in rig counts. Evan Calio : My second question if I could on PNG, as Total finalizes development plan for its proposed second facility, I think it's this quarter. Is there a potential for Exxon to recover more costs or improve your overall PNG LNG economics with a bigger integration of the two projects or infrastructure? Jeff Woodbury : Just broadly speaking and it's for a reason PNG Evan, because it really does spotlight the successful organization we have for our project execution in commercializing our resources. What a great success story with location that had limited infrastructure. The project was a significant feet for the organization in terms of being delivered on time and on budget, ramped up very quickly it's been held at design rates and we're just very pleased with the outcome. As you think beyond that ExxonMobil and its partners continue to assess additional resource opportunities. As you reflect on whether you can pull together enough resource in which to underpin a subsequent train that\u2019s part of what's being considered amongst the joint venture. I would tell you that will be the most cost effective option compared to another Greenfield development. Of course we are very well positioned there and we are open to options to try to reduce the overall cost structure for in general resource development was in Papua New Guinea. Evan Calio : Given the economics, superior economics you had on the Greenfield facility I presume a Brownfield expansion would be relatively high kind of within the rankings at your relative potentially upstream projects. Jeff Woodbury : Yes most definitely. Operator : We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez : I think you pretty adequately address Guy's question on the capital cost trend. But I was hoping you may elaborate a little bit more towards the operating cost side. Many of your peers have enacted hiring freezes and headcount reduction et cetera. And while I know we're not get a specific absolute dollar fig from you. I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about some trends we could expect to see on the operating cost side from just capital trends. Jeff Woodbury : Sure, Blake I would tell you that comments what I made earlier were really reflective of both our operating costs and our capital costs. The point I would emphasize for you is that really regardless of whether we're in the high price cycle or in a lower price cycle that we're in right now. The organization has remained focused on the fundamentals. And you've heard us say before that we're price takers. And we really focus on those things that we control. And those things that we control are things such as cost, our reliability our productivity and it's how we structure the organization in the most efficient way. I'd tell you that we are very well positioned we never lose sight of those fundamentals, but we're also very well poised that when we get into a down cycle like this that we can capture additional savings and as I alluded to previously that given our financial capability, we're also able to invest during the cycle and capture a lower cost structure on resources that we had plan to commercialize in the future. So, I think very well positioned, we've got a very capable organization that keeps their eye on the fundamentals through the cycle and I think we're as I've said in the past we got to lead that cost curve. Blake Fernandez : The second question is for you Jeff. The recent decision to increase the dividend, obviously an interesting time to enact that obviously demonstrates confidence. But noticing in the debt balance has increased about $11 billion from year ago levels. I'm just curious, if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about shareholder returns and using the balance sheet to continue levering up dependent on how long as down cycle would remain? Jeff Woodbury : I think it's good question Blake. When you think about from a perspective of our capital occasion, nothing has changed and we have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach throughout history in the highs and the lows with the focus on a long-term horizon. We remain committed to our shareholders to invest in attractive business opportunities that are accretive to financial performance and to continue paying a reliable and grown dividend. Across that business cycle I'd say that we manage the cash by as we've said before returning the access to our shareholders to share repurchases or borrowing the fund our investments. But I think what you've seen with the increase in the dividend -- we're continuing the stock purchases underscore our commitment to shareholder distributions. And I think it also demonstrates the confidence that we have in our integrated business model. Operator : Our next question comes from Asit Sen with Cowen and Company. Asit Sen : So two quick questions. First on LNG utilization, I think in your prepared remarks mentioned, utilization improving a little bit, could you elaborate, is it primarily related to PNG ramp up or is there anything else going on? Jeff Woodbury : So, LNG utilization is broadly defined by several operational commercial factors. I mean including maintenance, reliability of our facilities and then market and commercial considerations. Asit Sen : And then shifting gears to the Permian, Jeff last year Exxon added about 65,000 net acres in the core Wolfcamp. How do you see opportunities evolving in this current macro-environment and on that could you update us on activity and volume relative to last quarter please on the Shell plays? Jeff Woodbury : So broadly speaking, as I said, earlier when we're talking about M&A that we keep alert to where we got opportunities to build the portfolio with a creative assets, so those opportunities come along -- we'll go ahead and consider them. We're making great progress as you heard in our analyst meeting in terms of cost efficiency improvements, productivity improvements not only from our drilling completions but also initial well rates. So we really good progress, we get great opportunities in the Permian and in the Bakken. Just broadly speaking in the three key plays that liquid plays that we've in unconventional we're running just south of 40 rigs right now, that's been trending downward in part commensurate with the efficiency and productivity improvements that we've been able to capture. Asit Sen : And do you see -- how do you see this evolving in the balance of the year trending down through the year end? Jeff Woodbury : We have been trending downward like I said because we've been able to maintain real-time capture of additional benefits. So, I wouldn't translate that into a linear relationship with activity levels. Operator : We'll go next to Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward Westlake : Obviously just moving to Holland, Groningen's been in the news again. I'm just trying to understand what sort of decline did you assume that the Groningen field was going to have say over the next to 2017 in your planning numbers. And how do you assess the risk that it might actually be lower and then I have a follow up. Jeff Woodbury : Ed when you referred to decline, I think you're referring to the production constraints that have been post. Edward Westlake : And obviously you laid out a sort of corporate production objective for the firm, Groningen's a part of that. So was just trying to get a sense of what was already in the numbers -- so if it does get worse we can sort of quickly estimate the impact. Jeff Woodbury : So first let me start with the impacts in our operating performance here both quarter-over-quarter as well sequential, actually Netherlands was up due to higher demand but that was offset by some constraints. I'll be clear upfront Ed that we did incorporate the advertise restrictions into the volumes projections that we shared with you last month. Edward Westlake : So if they get worse then that would be a negative delta? Jeff Woodbury : It really is a function of what happens due to changes in demand throughout the year but certainly there is more extreme restrictions that will have an impact. Edward Westlake : And then a broader question which is more demand related obviously Exxon has refining chemicals upstream businesses around the world. You've started to see some demand estimates from the main agencies to be revised upwards, but apart from the sort of chink of light that you saw in Europe, your opening comments were little bit down based on the global economy. So just trying to gauge I guess whether you think that the recent increases in some of the demand estimates are real or not and if not what might be the reasons things like tertiary rebuilding? Jeff Woodbury : So from a downstream perspective, we did see margin improvements but due to several different reasons if you think about in Europe there was some capacity that was brought off line within both Europe and Asia as well as due to lower crude prices as well as some planned and unplanned maintenance that was taking capacity off the system. And then lastly there was some fundamental demand improvement in a number of products like gas, distillate, fuel oil. We saw similar benefits in the U.S. as well. Going into the future I would be bit reluctant to extrapolate that beyond this quarter. Edward Westlake : The earnings performance what about demands or both? Jeff Woodbury : You are talking about? Edward Westlake : Global demand for products. Jeff Woodbury : Global demand. Let me start with the chemicals business. Our projection on global demand for the chemicals business is that\u2019s going to continue to grow greater than the GDP about 1.5%. Refining demand will I think is function of what happens in the economies. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : I just wanted to ask specifically about the international upstream earnings, most of your peers have quantified the effect of the change in the UK tax laws within their releases, and I appreciate that you have addressed the variance that has occurred in the other section but I was hoping to get the absolute amount from you. Jeff Woodbury : So let me give you a little bit more color on just the tax rate. As you seen in our supplemental information we had effective tax rate of little over 33% and that\u2019s about a 12% drop quarter-on-quarter. And as you would appreciate the effective tax rate is an outcome of our business results across the geographies in which we operate within, now most of that drop was really due to the portfolio mix of income across our business segments and our geographies, about 3% of that was associated with one-time tax items primarily the UK tax rate change which amounted to about $200 million positive impact on earnings. Jason Gammel : Another question, that\u2019s completely separate topic, just in the current oil price environment, haven't seen a lot of deflation yet. Are you expecting to make any FIDs this year? And if you could address Hadria North specifically? Jeff Woodbury : So Jason I would encourage you go look at our recent financial operating review, if you look at that you will see that we have a list of projects that we anticipate that will start up post 2017, and that will give you a sense for the next tranche of development opportunities that are currently in play. And many of these are in development planning stages or even some in pre-FID. And that will give you a sense for what\u2019s on the horizon. We don't broadcast planned FIDs in the future but we do give you a pretty detailed list of what\u2019s out there that we are working on. Jason Gammel : Maybe if I could just put it another way, have you seen enough cost deflation in the deepwater yet to maybe accelerate your investment potential in that area or have you seen very little in terms of cost deflation? Jeff Woodbury : Frankly I will tell you Jason that we are never really satisfied with the cost structure and we will always continue to work on it, but as you can appreciate there are lot of factors and as I indicated earlier we have seen a where I consider early innings of reductions in services like rig rates, we expect that we would be able to do a lot more. And as I alluded to previously that also includes an expectation within our organization that will be able to further optimize these development plans to maximize shareholder returns. But I'd tell you that we got a very, very large diverse resource base to work on, it allows us to be very selective in what we decided to pursue. And when we decide when we get to an FID stage it's been tested across a range of economic considerations since that was confident it's going to be accretive to overall financial performance. Operator : Phil Gresh from JP Morgan has our next question. Phil Gresh : One question on the quarter you talked about the benefit from lower tax rates, I know you'd proceeds from assets sales as well. So just wondering if there any one-time benefits from assets sale gains? Jeff Woodbury : As you say in our materials that we sent out there was about just under $500 million cash flow benefited associated with assets sales. That translates to about a 50% reduction in the number if you unwind the remaining un-depreciated investment that we have on our books. And those proceeds are really result of sales really across tour upstream and downstream businesses. Phil Gresh : And then you've talked about a fair number of investment you're making Europe to high grade your refining capacity to this lift. I guess maybe just give us an update or remind me when that\u2019s supposed to be coming online. And then on the U.S. side what opportunities might there be to debottleneck or add new capacity here over the next few years, if you think that that\u2019s a decent return project. Jeff Woodbury : Phil I guess you're referring to our Antwerp coker? Phil Gresh : Yes exactly. Jeff Woodbury : So really good progress on that investment opportunity, I'd tell you that it's progressing towards 2017 start up. Phil Gresh : And then on the U.S. do you see any opportunities there to debottleneck capacity or add new capacity in any of your refineries in the next few years? Jeff Woodbury : No we regularly evaluate our portfolio book in the U.S. internationally for where we can capture additional value for earnings growth. I'd tell you that while I'm not in a position go ahead and give you any indications specifically that we keep very mindful of where we can capture additional value and primarily falls in fork here is one is trying to further improve our flexibility of our feedstock. Two, is opportunities that we can further reduce our cost structure. The third one would be in areas where we can increase our higher value product yields. And then lastly as you saw with Edmonton Rail Terminal improving our overall logistics flexibility. Operator : We'll go next to Douglas Terreson with Evercore ISI. Douglas Terreson : So my question is also on Groningen, there is been a lot of commentary about the issue surrounding seismic conditions and property in the area. My question is whether or not we could kind of get a little bit more color on the situation. Meaning it sounds like when you answered Ed questions a few minutes ago that the implication for production maybe negligible. But I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. And then also, there is also been talks of some financial penalties too. So in commentary that you could provide that would help us sort this out would be appreciated. Jeff Woodbury : Yes so most of the information as you know is been digested in the media. Just broadly speaking the original target was about 42 billion cubic meters in 2014, that\u2019s been originally reduced down about 36 billion cubic meters and then in the first half 2015 down to 16.5. It's still very dynamic issue. Our understanding is there will be some further guidance from the government coming out in July. But broadly speaking as I refer to it previously our production guidance has been incorporating the reduction production constraints that had been advertised externally. But it is having an impact and I don\u2019t want to mislead to anybody. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow up on an earlier comments that you made on Canadian crude. How big is the rail terminal that you are working on up there and how much crude can you actually move out of there by rail once it up and running. And can you give us any difference is obviously been very tough out there in terms of heavy barrels, any thoughts does in the crude terminal in terms of ways in which might be other optimize pricing going forward? Jeff Woodbury : So the capacity of that terminal was just over 200,000 barrels a day 210,000 barrels to be exact. You emphasize a point I made earlier that it's part of our integrated businesses. It's a key element for us to connect our upstream business to our refining and chemicals business throughout the Gulf coast and the Mid-Continent. Ryan Todd : And then maybe a quick follow-up on gas decline as well. We saw a relatively steep decline in U.S. gas lines quarter-on-quarter and really there is a lot of quarter-to-quarter volatility. But can you give us an idea of generally a good assumption for what you would assume for annual decline rate in U.S. gas? Jeff Woodbury : I would say just to your point, our gas activity is been fairly limited in the U.S. We have really transitioned a lot of our drilling activity in lower 48 to liquids place obviously because we see the value proposition stronger, but I really backup and highlight the point that there is a real opportunity in the U.S. to commercialize this gas if we were to remove some of the barriers that we've got before us, and we've got as you all are aware we've got an investment pending in Golden Pass to convert that terminal to LNG export facility. We think we\u2019re well positioned with infrastructure, we think it is a great opportunity for United States if we could increase the export options for the U.S. producers is going to create additional investment, it's going to create additional jobs, and bottom-line it's going to improve the economy. So I think the call to the government would be one of really taking advantage of the opportunity that the U.S. has to really build energy security not only in the U.S. but more globally by providing if you will free-trading. Operator : Roger Read with Wells Fargo has our next question. Roger Read : I would like to follow-up a little bit on some of the volume guidance and the entitlements in a fairly significant amount of barrels that came back in. And as you think about the 4.1 million barrels for the full year the outperformance in Q2. Is there upside based on entitlements or would you say your projection based on expectation in the future curve as oil pricing et cetera that we should think as 4.1 is really the right number. Jeff Woodbury : I would tell you, if you go back to the analyst presentation, we had assumed just for the sake of the presentation itself we assumed Brent price of $55 per barrel, and of course flow that into our production sharing contracts to give you a sense for what we would expect in terms of volume and that is target of 4.1 million barrels per day, obviously if prices up or down is going to have an impact. It's really -- I really don't have a rule of thumb for you when it comes down an entitlement impacts which as you know include many different factors including the commercial structure as well as expenditure levels and obviously price. But we had assumed a price forecast is comparable to where we\u2019re right now. Roger Read : And then back to the OpEx cost reductions is there any guidance you can provide us on or any help you can provide us in terms of how that work its way into this system or whether or not most of that has been captured during the first half of this year or so Q1 and in the Q2? Jeff Woodbury : In fact the guidance I gave you Roger is that we\u2019re going to see further capture opportunities as we progress through the year. Roger Read : So should we think majority is come through or minority, morality? Jeff Woodbury : We have been able to capture savings in the first quarter, but as I alluded to not all parts of our cost structure have responded in the same level and we will continue to progress those and we expect increased savings over time. Operator : We will go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Most of my questions have been answered but I will try more on macro one. Obviously Exxon is always prior to itself on investing with more long-term demand view point. Do you think that with the current down cycle we've taken enough CapEx out of the industry that we\u2019re going to face more of supply demand squeeze going forward maybe later in the decade or early in the 2020? Jeff Woodbury : That\u2019s a hard one to really answer. I would step back and just think about the overall energy outlook that we publish annually. We are fairly confident given the range of variables that we test that we\u2019re looking at about a 35% growth in energy demand between 2010 and 2040. Fundamentally that is how ExxonMobil sets its investment plans. And obviously we continue to test that not only annually but periodically in terms of how the business more broadly speaking is investing whether that\u2019s going to be sufficient to meet that energy growth over time there are a lot of variables in it including you may recall that inner energy outlook it really does require a very healthy progress on energy conservation. But broadly speaking it's hard for me to say whether the current level investment will cause any shortages in the future. Operator : We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with TPH. Anish Kapadia : I have couple of questions, first one was to get your thoughts on Tanzania LNG. I saw that you went non-concern on the last exploration well with Statoil and it didn\u2019t think that featured in any of the four projects you highlighted on the slide in the Analyst Day. Just wondering if this is something that\u2019s going to drop to the back of the queue that you've prioritized in this kind of environment and your CapEx cut back. Jeff Woodbury : Not at all, Tanzania for the benefits of the people are on the phone Block 2 today we have participated in seven gas discoveries we think total resource and places in excess of 20 TCF now. There is a lot of work to do in a Greenfield development like this we Statoil and ExxonMobil have been progressing development plans for the initial discoveries. And then there is a broader consortium that has been looking at the potential for onshore LNG facility. We would tell you that upfront planning is progressing. I will confirm that there was one well we do not participate in. But I wouldn\u2019t use that as an indication of our lack of commitment. I think what's important here as we go forward is we get better definition of the project. But equally important you all know that LNG projects are capital intensive and what we need to ensure is that we have a stable fiscal regime with appropriate terms and conditions to underpin that type of investment. Anish Kapadia : And one follow up question on the -- going back to the acquisition market what we're seeing is. It seems like lot of the U.S and E&P companies we integrated pulling out of international investing more in U.S see a similar trends with some of the NOCs. So just wondering are you seeing more value internationally and less competition and for actually for assets now relative to the U.S market. Jeff Woodbury : Well I think broadly speaking it's a good observation, broadly speaking I think when capital becomes constraint that by definition that provides additional opportunities. I would say that from our perspective it's the value proposition that we bring that we hope that resource owners will look to and that is our strong balance sheet our leading return on capital employed, our operational expertise, the technology that we bring to resource development. I'll say that we have one of the best if not the best project execution organizations. And then we've got a leading downstream and chemical business that\u2019s fully integrated with our upstream and I'd say that as a package those characteristics provide if you will the winning proposition for resource owners. Operator : Our last question today comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Can I go back to the balance sheet? You've always said maintaining triple A is critical given that you are not currently funding the dividend and the buyback from cash flow. What do you think is the cushion that you have in billions to lever up and still maintain the triple A? Jeff Woodbury : I'd say that triple A is really an outcome of our financial strategies. As you heard us say previously that operating cash flows our primary sources of funding for both of our cap departments and shareholder distributions. We maintain a very strong focus and prudent approach to cash management throughout that cycle. We have as you know significant debt capacity. But we'll maintain our financial flexibility and we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we invest and what we choose to invest in but we're not going to forgo attractive opportunities and I think that\u2019s a key differentiating factor for ExxonMobil that we got the capability to respond when we need to respond. And we're very mindful of our cash balances and how far we want to take our investment program. Pavel Molchanov : Can I ask you just a little bit on that, have you looked at what the credit agencies might say if you take on an additional 5 billion to 10 billion over the next year, 1.5 years? Jeff Woodbury : We're very -- obviously we look at all the variables when we talk about our cash management and our financing capability, we keep the very mindful look at what our comment mature in the future, but I'll tell you that we're very comfortable and we're very mindful about where we're in terms of our debt. But I've just not going to quote any specific numbers. Operator : With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the callback over to Mr. Woodbury for any additional and closing remark. Jeff Woodbury : First and foremost I want to say thank you for your questions, very good, very insightful and I think it really brings with more color to our business. So to conclude, I just want to thank you for your time and we're very much due appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen again that's does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining.",

Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research Alastair Syme - Citigroup Guy Baber - Simmons & Company John Herrlin - Societe Generale Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call and Webcast. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web-site. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Now turning to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the second quarter. We are delivering on our investment and operating commitments across our integrated portfolio. Corporation's results demonstrate sound operations, superior project execution capabilities and continued discipline in both capital and expense management. Downstream and Chemical earnings increased significantly from the second quarter of 2014 driven by higher margins, continued strong demand and the quality of our product and asset mix. Upstream production volumes of 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day were 3.6% higher compared to a year ago quarter and liquids volumes were up nearly 12%. Growth was underpinned by an increased level of new development start-ups over the last 18 months, largely in Africa, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the United States. These results underscore the resilience of our integrated portfolio and the benefits of our disciplined capital allocation. In the first half of 2015, the Corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion with free cash flow remaining positive despite challenging market conditions. Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth improved in the second quarter of 2015. The U.S. rebounded after contracting slightly in the first quarter. Europe improved marginally amid concerns on Greece, China's economy stabilized, while Japan's growth tapered. Crude oil prices partly recovered during the quarter while natural gas prices declined further. Refining margins continued to strengthen in both the U.S. and Europe. Chemical commodity margins also improved while specialty margins weakened. Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated, second quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, which represents $1 per share. Corporation distributed $4.1 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $1 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $8.3 billion, which is in line with plans. We have remained focused on structural improvements through capital efficiency as well as the capture of additional cost savings in a softer market. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.4 billion, and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $33.8 billion. Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of funds. For the quarter, cash decreased from $5.2 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $9.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $7.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to be $500 million in the third quarter of 2015. Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil second quarter earnings of $4.2 billion were down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter. Lower Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream and Chemical results. Gains on asset sales were $1.2 billion lower than the second quarter of 2014, reflecting the absence of the Hong Kong power and Canadian asset divestments in the Upstream segment. I'll also note that our corporate effective tax rate was 45%, up 4 percentage points compared to the year ago quarter and up 12 percentage points sequentially. This higher tax rate reflects the relative mix of income across geographies and tax regimes as well as a one-time increase in the corporate income tax rate in Alberta, Canada. In the sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $750 million as lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partly offset by higher Chemical results. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter. Now turning to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9, Upstream earnings in the second quarter were $2 billion, down $5.9 billion from the second quarter of 2014. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $1.5 billion where crude declined by almost $46 per barrel and gas was down almost $2.40 per thousand cubic feet. Note that favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $330 million driven by production growth on our new developments. All other items were negative $1.7 billion and this was driven by the absence of divestment gains from Hong Kong power and Western Canadian assets which represented $1.6 billion. Also, the higher income tax rate in Alberta, Canada resulted in a negative $260 million non-cash deferred tax adjustment. Lower operating costs provided a partial offset. Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 139,000 barrels per day or 3.6% compared to the second quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 243,000 barrels per day or nearly 12%, benefiting from new projects or programs and favorable entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 622 million cubic feet per day or 5.8% driven by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. Volume adds from the Papua New Guinea LNG and Hadrian South projects along with entitlement effects offset build decline. Now turning to sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, Upstream earnings were $824 million lower than the first quarter. Realizations increased earnings by $600 million as crude was up almost $11 per barrel while gas declined about $1 per 1,000 cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $420 million driven by lower seasonal gas demand in Europe, regulatory constraints in the Netherlands and maintenance in the U.S. All other items reduced earnings by $1 billion, mainly driven by unfavorable tax and foreign exchange effects and lower gains from asset sales. Upstream unit profitability for the second quarter was $5.77 per barrel, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Earnings per barrel for the first half of 2015 was $6.74. Moving to Slide 12, sequentially, volumes were down 269,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 6.3%. Liquids production increased 14,000 barrels per day on new project growth and work programs, partly offset by maintenance, entitlement effects and field decline. Natural gas production was down 1.7 billion cubic feet per day driven by lower seasonal demand in Europe and regulatory constraints in the Netherlands. Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up $795 million compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our margins increased earnings by $1.1 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $80 million. All other items reduced earnings by $230 million, driven by higher maintenance activities. Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $161 million. Stronger refining margins mainly in the U.S. increased earnings by $140 million whereas higher maintenance activities reduced volumes and increased expenses by $160 million and $140 million respectively. Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on Slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings were more than $1.2 billion, up $405 million versus the prior year quarter. Our margins increased earnings by $340 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $20 million. All other items increased earnings by $50 million, mainly due to asset management gains, partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Moving to Slide 16, sequentially, Chemical earnings increased by $264 million. Lower margins decreased earnings by $10 million. Positive volume and mix effects increased earnings by $40 million. All other items added $230 million as asset management gains were partly offset by higher maintenance. Moving next to an update on our exploration and project activities on Slide 17, we continue to focus on pursuing a diverse set of high-quality resource opportunities. In Guyana, ExxonMobil made a significant oil discovery on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block well which was drilled approximately 120 miles offshore, encountered more than 295 feet of high-quality oil\u2011bearing sandstone reservoirs. We are encouraged by these results and we're assessing commercial viability of the resource as well as evaluating additional potential on the block. In Romania, drilling continues in the deepwater Neptun Block with five wells drilled to date. The potential for commercial development will be assessed after completion of the drilling program. In the Kurdistan region of Iraq, drilling activities on the [Al-Kush] [ph] Block are underway and anticipated to finish later this year. Turning now to the status update on our new development projects, in Canada, the Kearl expansion project started up ahead of schedule in June and is currently producing more than 100,000 barrels of bitumen per day. This development of the Kearl resource enabled us to draw significant learnings from the initial development project and capture lower capital costs and operating efficiencies. From Kearl, production averaged 130,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and is ultimately expected to reach 220,000 barrels per day. Erha North Phase 2 in Nigeria is another example of a capital efficient development. This subsea project utilizes existing processing facilities and avoids the need for an additional FPSO vessel. Deepwater drilling and subsea equipment installation are progressing with start-up expected later this year. And at the Banyu Urip development in Indonesia, we continue to experience favorable well performance and production is now more than 80,000 barrels per day. The central processing facility is expected to start up in the next few months which will enable the project to reach peak production of more than 200,000 barrels per day by year-end. In the U.S., Lower 48 onshore, we have maintained a measured investment program to unlock the value of more than 15 billion oil equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil is a leading producer onshore and the largest producer in the United States. Through our XTO affiliate, we operate in all major U.S. unconventional oil and gas plays. Longer-term, gas investment is paced with anticipated demand growth whereas near-term emphasis is on the development of 2.4 million net acres in the liquids rich Bakken, Permian and Woodford, Ardmore and Marietta where investment opportunities remain attractive in phased price environment. Net production in these three areas was about 240,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the second quarter, up more than 20% from the second quarter of last year. Throughout the commodity price cycle, ExxonMobil has a relentless focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency in our operations while maintaining high operational integrity. We regularly assess our performance relative to the competitors and strive to be best in class. So as this chart illustrates, our efforts deliver results. XTO is a leader in exploration and development costs per barrel of crude reserves added, just one metric of many that are considered. This position is enabled by our disciplined and measured approach to resource development, deployment of proprietary technologies and our intense focus on efficiency and productivity. We also demonstrated the capability to respond quickly and a rapidly changing environment and to date have captured incremental savings of about 30% drilling and completion cost from the peak in 2014. These savings include market benefits as well as ongoing structural cost efficiencies and productivity improvements across our operations. So I'd like to conclude this morning's comments with a summary of our year-to-date performance. In short, the Corporation is delivering on its investment and operating commitments. Through midyear, ExxonMobil earned $9.1 billion benefiting from our integrated business which captures value throughout the commodity price cycle as demonstrated by our Downstream and Chemical results. In the Upstream, production increased to 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up almost 3% year on year and remains in line with our plans. Volume contributions from successful new developments underscore our superb project execution capabilities and reputation as a reliable operator. Our operational results combined with continued capital discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $17.9 billion and free cash flow of $3.9 billion. Our commitment to our shareholders remains strong as the Corporation distributed $8 billion to shareholders through midyear. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. That concludes my prepared remarks and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. Phil Gresh : First question is one asking the CapEx, what your latest thoughts are for the budget for this year, and then as we look ahead post 2015, at the Analyst Day you said sub-$34 billion, it was a bit vague, a lot of your peers have been talking about reducing their sustaining capital cost as you look ahead. So just wanted to get any thoughts from you about perhaps where CapEx could go over the next few years, if you have any updates. Jeff Woodbury : I'll tell you that we have no new guidance on our \u2013 so our CapEx guidance for 2015 remains at $34 billion, but having said, given our ongoing focus on capital efficiency and the very successful capture of market savings in the current business climate, I think it is fair to say that there is a downward vector on that number. And that type of focus and efficiency will be carried on into the subsequent years. I haven't said that, also note that we continue to invest in the business and we have a very attractive inventory of high-quality opportunities, and given the financial flexibility we've got, we can garner some real benefits during the down cycle in a softer market environment. Phil Gresh : Sure, okay. Second question is on the acquisition environment, seems like others have been talking about the bid ask spread, maybe starting to improve a bit here, maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing, are any attractive opportunities starting to pop up on your radar screen, and just more broadly, as you think about the portfolio, are there places where you think inorganically you'd like to shift the mix every time, and I'm specifically thinking about short cycle? Jeff Woodbury : Let me just broadly speak on acquisition or what we like to say as asset management, I characterize it for us as businesses as normal. We always keep alert to value opportunities not only to pick up what we believe is strategic and high-value opportunities but looking for means to create greater value from our existing portfolio. So we keep alert in terms of what we would target. If you step back and think about the diversity of our resource base, we're very well covered across all of the resource types. We're always interested in expanding those positions or further high-grading them. So I wouldn't suggest that as we consider opportunities for picking up additional assets that we're more focused in one area or the other, we're always looking for high-grade in the portfolio. And Phil, that also includes our exploration program. It is designed to identify higher value opportunities to be added to the resource base or maybe to displace what we see is not as relatively significant as the exploration program can add to. Operator : Next we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Sorry my line cut out there for a minute, so I hope this question hasn't been asked already, but there's two things I wanted to hit this morning, Jeff, if I may. First one is on tax. I'm trying to understand the extent of I guess the mess on the internationally Imperial we're all looking at anyway, and we're noting what Imperial did with their tax charge related to the change in the Canadian tax regime. So I wonder if you could address that issue first, and then I have a follow-up please. Jeff Woodbury : So if you look at our tax in the second quarter of 2015 relative to 2014, we're up just over 3%. I'd say that about 5% of that were associated with one-time tax items, the largest piece being in the Alberta tax that I mentioned in my prepared comments. The rest of the closure on that, down about 1% is really due to the portfolio mix of income across our various business segments and geographies. If you look sequentially, Doug, we're up almost 12%. And again, the mix effect adds about a 6% increase and the one-time items add about 6%, 4% due to the Alberta tax increase and then just under 2% associated with the absence of the first quarter U.K.'s tax rate change. Doug Leggate : In absolute terms, Jeff, order of magnitude it looks to us like that was somewhere around $0.10 or $0.12 in the quarter of non-recurring non-cash. Is that sum about right? Jeff Woodbury : Say a little bit more, Doug, on how you're coming up with that. Doug Leggate : So I think the $320 million was what Imperial took, that alone is $0.08, right? Jeff Woodbury : The Alberta, as I said in my prepared comments, Doug, was about $260 million ExxonMobil share. Doug Leggate : Okay, alright. I'll go back and look at that. My follow-up is really on the Downstream. I mean obviously, I realize for commercial reasons you don't want to talk about Torrance explicitly but when we look at the can of results that other West Coast operators have had and the relatively weak year at Downstream that you had, it kind of strikes me that you probably have some \u2013 there's probably some merit in giving us some idea of what the likelihood of Torrance coming back on line is without all the additional cost of importing gasoline and so on. So to the best that you can at this point, Jeff, can you give us an order of magnitude in terms of timing as to when you expect Torrance to get back to where it ought to be? Jeff Woodbury : I think first if I could, Doug, just to comment on your statement about a relatively weak Downstream in the second quarter, now I'd first say that we've seen significant margin improvement relative to last year. Second, as I commented on, we did have a very heavy maintenance period in the second quarter of 2015 and that had the downward impacts I referenced in my prepared comments. In terms of Torrance, I think you probably know, Doug, that some of the units in the refinery are operational that reduced rates. We are producing gasoline by importing components and blending with refinery production, and I'd also say we're also producing distillates. We are progressing repair of the electrostatic precipitator as well as pursuing interim options. It is difficult to provide you a time at this point, given the definition work that's underway as well as the regulatory review that's underway. As we get closer to defining that timeline, we'll look for an opportunity to share that broadly. Doug Leggate : I appreciate you there. You've at least taken a stab at the answer. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard and Weil. Blake Fernandez : Question for you on the gas volumes which were fairly weak, I think you pointed out in the press release 622 million cubic feet down year-over-year. Could you highlight the Netherlands component of that, maybe give us an update of, for one, what contribution the Netherlands had in that decline, and then maybe some timing or outlook on when that may come back? Jeff Woodbury : The Netherlands was, as you could appreciate, a large component. It was about 600 million in the second quarter relative to the prior year, prior quarter. Blake Fernandez : Okay, and any thoughts on when that may return to market? Jeff Woodbury : The Netherlands on a quarter to quarter basis was also say with the regulatory restrictions that the government has placed on the asset, and that will return over time but it's going to be a constrained cap on what we can produce from the resource. Blake Fernandez : Okay, fair enough. The second question for you, on Slide 11 you highlighted some of the sequential decline. I guess I know the benchmarks were up, I know you've got some issues with tax and whatnot, but that $1 billion waterfall on other category, can you kind of highlight what is in there besides tax and then also if you could maybe highlight some of the LNG impacts? I know pricing got clearly weak this quarter. Jeff Woodbury : So on the $1 billion other component, this is the [indiscernible] and about 60% of that had to do with tax, 15% or so was Forex and the rest is a number of other puts and takes. On your comment about LNG, let me just broadly say that our natural gas realizations had a negative effect of about $300 million. So to square that with the $600 million increase in realizations, we had about $900 million positive due to liquids and $300 million due to negative gas realizations. Operator : We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Let me follow up on CapEx and the down-cycle approach, your peers appear or at least are more vocal in cost-cutting and laying off employees, increasing asset sales and reducing the forward CapEx guidance to close their funding gaps by almost extensional upstream struggle. So I mean your releasing call has been different. Is that just stylistic or does it mean a different approach by Exxon through the down-cycle, any comments there? Jeff Woodbury : I would back up and just talk fundamentally. Culturally, the organization is designed to constantly focus on capital efficiency and cost management, okay. What we are looking for always, Evan, is to drive the cost structure down in the business, okay, and when we have a down-cycle like we're seeing right now, we further are well-positioned to quickly lead that cost curve in capturing market savings. Now on top of that, we've got that financial flexibility to invest through the cycle and that does very much very well position us to capture those market savings in the down-cycle. So in short, I'd say it is a focus regardless of where we are in the cycle. Likewise on staffing, I mean you mentioned common staffing. I mean first and foremost, I want to highlight that our people are our greatest asset and they really drive the success of this Company. Therefore we take a very measured approach managing our headcount given the cyclical nature of the business and the need for us to be ever more productive and in doing so we keep an unrelenting focus on capturing organizational efficiencies to keep the organization right sized, again, given the likelihood of business volatility. So if you look at our employee headcount, it has been coming down consistently since the merger of Exxon and Mobil where we were at about 125,000 employees, today we're at just over 80,000 employees. And you may recall during Analyst Meeting that the Chairman talked about some this and he gave some examples by way of steps that we've taken well in advance of the down-cycle in order to do exactly what the numbers are depicting. Evan Calio : Right, and your CapEx appears to be trending at least below guidance so far this year. My follow-up on the Downstream and maybe as it relates to the U.S. Upstream, I mean can you discuss like crude transfer pricing assumptions between North American Upstream and refining? I mean it would appear that refining with offset may not be entirely market-based kind of understating refining and transferring some of that to your Upstream, any color there would be helpful. Jeff Woodbury : I mean it is very much market-based. I mean as you know that our integrated sites have the capability to run at very, very wide range of feedstocks. I can't get into the specific pricing at all but we have very competitive capacity within the U.S., we're the largest in the Gulf Coast and mid-continent. As you know, our capacity increase is greater than our overall U.S. production. So we're also out there picking up supplies that meet our systems needs. Our mid-continent and Gulf Coast refineries have increased processing of advantaged North American crudes. Currently about 45% of the slate was North America in 2011 and currently we're at about 70% in 2014. The key point I want to emphasize here is that we get intrinsic value given the integration of our operations between Upstream, Downstream and the Chemical business, allowing us to really focus on optimizing the value of the molecule. Operator : Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse has our next question. Edward Westlake : This is just a philosophical question. I mean, Jeff, you've got a great balance sheet and you've just reduced the buyback. Are you worried about future deterioration in cash flows due to the macro, is this just a decision that's just made quarter to quarter without thinking about the implications? I know people are chattering in the market this morning that you're trying to conserve cash for M&A, so maybe just a comment there, and then I've got a detailed comment on the results. Jeff Woodbury : Ed, just go back, fundamentally our business plans and our investment strategy comes from our perspective on the long-term that we share with you all in our energy outlook. That's what really sets our business strategy and our investment outlook. Now stepping back from that, we maintain a very robust balance sheet as you say and we have the significant inventory investment opportunities, over 90 billion barrels of high-quality resource, a very strong inventory of Downstream and Chemical opportunities, but we manage the cash flow looking at the current business climate as well as the future outlook and we have a high degree of confidence in what we expect supply/demand to do in the future. Fundamentally, we're committed to our shareholders to continue to provide a reliable and grown dividend and I think the continued buyback is evidence of the confidence that we have in the integrated business model. Edward Westlake : You mentioned the LNG impact which was helpful. Obviously Asia LNG prices might come in the spot market particularly, not contract, come under where the pressure is. All of these Australian projects try and fight their way into market and they all have commission cargoes and some spot with them. Can you sort of give us a sense of how much flexibility in the overall contract structure your customers have to sort of say, we're going to take minimum amounts of volumes to maximize our advantage to take some perhaps the cheapest bulk cargoes that are available? I'm just trying to get a sense of is there a little bit of the margin or price risk and volume risk even to your sort of existing LNG business, and it's fine for you to say, no, there's not a big risk, I mean that could just be the answer. Jeff Woodbury : Sure. I'd just remind you that a majority of our LNG is under long-term contract. So we have very little spot risk and we've got diversion capability in the existing contracts to allow us to capture a greater value there. Edward Westlake : So if Asia says, no, you can put it into Europe or do something else from the Middle East. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : So it's pretty clear that there is a path to grow production through 2017 with some of these large capital projects that you talked about and seeing indications of production growth here in 2015, one of the questions investors frequently ask is, how does Exxon grow production post 2017 which we'll probably get some line of sight on at the next Analyst Day when you roll forward past 2017, but any initial color about how you think about growth especially if the forward curve proves correct post 2017 would be valuable? Jeff Woodbury : I'd say first and foremost, just step back a moment and remind everybody that based on that very sizable high-quality resource base we've been talking about, we've had a very significant Upstream investment program in place now for some period of time whereby from 2012 to 2017 we had committed to our shareholders to bring on 32 high-quality long-life assets. We're about halfway through that in terms of starting them up. We had a very substantial tranche of them starting up in 2014 with eight. This year we have another seven starting up. As you go into 2016-2017, we've got the rest of them coming on. The information that we had shared back at Analyst Meeting, we would grow capacity by about 1.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, and recognizing that those projects are starting up in 2017, we're just at the early stages, they would ramp up into 2018 and thereafter. We also shared, Neil, in our F&O review the list of projects that we've got on the table right now for 2018 forward. These are all in different stages of progress, some are in development planning, some are in [beat] [ph], but that is the list that we are working on to bring to an FID decision. Some of these that we're working to further optimize in the current price environment, some may have some opportunities to enhance the commercial terms, but as we get closer to FID's decisions, we'll signal where we are. As you indicated, we'll provide another update in March of next year which will take us beyond the 2017 horizon. But all that said, I want to reinforce that we've got this very robust inventory of investment opportunities and I don't want to focus just on the Upstream, the Downstream and Chemical business as well, and that positions us well to be very selective on what we want to progress and when we want to progress, and it gives us the capability on those other assets or investment opportunities to keep working on them to make sure that we're capturing the greatest value from it. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Jeff. And then the follow-up is on that point about Chemicals, it was one of the few places in the quarter where we saw a real upside to our numbers. Just wanted to talk about what you're seeing from the macro in the Chemical space, clearly margins having compressed as much as some would've thought given the move down in Brent and then just how you're thinking about growing that business on a go forward. Jeff Woodbury : So just broadly speaking, as you can appreciate, there are structural differences in the Chemical business. U.S. natural gas, natural gas liquids provide for very strong margins and advantage polyethylene. In Europe, Asia-Pacific, the liquids fees, energy prices have been hard and we were at the bottom cycle in Asia-Pacific but we saw in the first half material improvement due to lower fees and energy costs. Specialty margins have declined over the past few years with capacity additions exceeding demand growth, but demand growth remains robust. So as we've said before, our long-term business we have a positive outlook for global demand expecting to exceed GDP by about 1.5%, or said in another way, growing by more than 50% over the next 10 years, of which about two thirds of that will be in Asia. So very well positioned to participate, as you see that we're making some important investments like the expansion of Baytown that allows us to continue to participate in the high value polyethylene market given the very low feed cost we have here in North America. Operator : We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar. Allen Good : I appreciate the comments on the whole savings in the U.S. Lower 48. I wonder if you could offer what Exxon is seeing as far as cost savings internationally, free the projects under construction, maybe some currently in the development phase and maybe even offshore as well, do you expect to capture some of the cost savings there and what would be some of the timing on that relative to what you've seen so far in the U.S.? Jeff Woodbury : I would tell you Allen that let me break it up between capital and expense, and to answer your question right now, yes, we are capturing cost savings across our global portfolio. On the cost side, I just want to keep on emphasizing, cost management is a fundamental driver in the success of our business, no doubt about it, and throughout that business cycle our organization has a strong culture of driving down the cost structure and then when we're in these down cycles we expect to lead the cost curve and capture additional market savings, so ongoing structure improvements and additional market savings in the down-cycle. So we're very well positioned and one of the things that allows us to react very quick, as I mentioned last quarter, is that we've got a global procurement organization that is always focused on capturing the lowest lifecycle cost and they are absolutely critical in managing our overall cost structure. As you can appreciate, Allen, savings vary significantly by region and type of service. By way of example, our base metals are down as much as 40%. Engineering services and construction labor is down 10% plus. Rig rates are down across the board both land and floater. On floater, the day rates of mobilization costs are down anywhere from 25% to 40%. So we're well positioned to capture that both on the cost as well as the capital side. Allen Good : Great, thanks. One more question, maybe a bit premature but certainly made headlines of late, along with the Iran deal, it seems that some of your peers have become interested, I know there's been some headlines suggesting Exxon as well, what would you need to see in Iran as far as milestones for you potentially become interesting and doing business there? Jeff Woodbury : Allen, I'd just say that we'll continue to monitor the circumstance and I want to be really clear that we'll remain in full compliance with existing sanctions. As you know there are multiple sanctions that apply to U.S. companies. That's all I can really say about that right now, Allen. Operator : We'll go next to Asit Sen with Cowen and Company. Asit Sen : Two questions. Thanks for the additional color on Lower 48. I'm wondering if you could give us the breakdown in the production and rig activity by the three main unconventional plays and talk about how you expect things tracking in the back half of the year. Jeff Woodbury : So really good growth there, I mean from a net production basis, as I said we're producing about 240,000 barrels a day, over 20% increase quarter on quarter versus the prior year. Permian is about 120,000 barrels of that, Bakken just over 80,000 barrels, and Woodford is about 40,000 barrels. Asit Sen : And rig activity please? Jeff Woodbury : So our rig counts have come down just a little bit. From the first quarter we're down about 10 rigs, so we're currently running 34 rigs in those three plays. We've been able to continue to high-grade the activity. I think as we showed in the Analyst Meeting, we continue to capture both cost efficiencies and productivity improvements. A lot of what we learned in these plays are being quickly shared to make sure that we're integrating all those learnings into our forward execution plans, but very pleased with the positions that we've got in those assets and we've got a very sizable inventory of drillable prospects. Asit Sen : So would you think that there would be upside to the incremental 2017 target? I think it was 150,000 barrels a day. Would you, given efficiencies? Jeff Woodbury : I mean we are keeping a measured pace as we said previously. If you think back over the ups and downs, when everybody was really picking up a lot of rigs, we took a measured pace and made sure that we were going at a pace that we can fully capture the benefits of the learnings that we were realizing. Likewise in the down-cycle, our rig counts haven't come down as significant as you've seen in the industry because we've been able to capture those learnings, the economics of these investments are still robust. So I would give you a response of a measured pace that with a very attractive inventory of opportunities, we'll keep moving forward and anticipate as we showed in the Analyst Meeting a growth in our unconventional liquids volumes. Asit Sen : Great. And my second question is on LNG. Spot LNG market has been surprisingly strong, over $8 near-term, would be 15% oil equivalent. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that, is it seasonality or something else, and could you update on the demand pattern that you're seeing in Asia? Jeff Woodbury : Broadly speaking, I mean as you can appreciate, there's a lot that goes into this. As we've said, gas demand has grown at about 1.6% per year. LNG capacity will probably triple from 2010 to 2040. So you're seeing a general demand growth that's underpinning, obviously underpinning realizations. There are a lot of other country-level dynamics like alternatives, nuclear power, fuel switching from coal to gas, all those variables really play into this 1.6% per year that I mentioned. Operator : Paul Cheng with Barclays has our next question. Paul Cheng : Two questions if I could, if we're looking at your very sizable total resource which is over [indiscernible], do you have a rough estimate that what's the percentage of that resource base already passed all the regulatory hurdle and with today's technology will be able to produce and earn a 10% after-tax [indiscernible] way of return a $60 to $70 barrel price, any kind of color you can provide? Jeff Woodbury : I would tell you, I'd actually think about it differently, Paul, and that the resource base is in various stages of development planning. Some assets clearly, as I indicated previously to Neil, some of those assets are currently on the table right now in development planning and pre-feed, some of the assets are probable reserves in our possible or static resources or under various stages of development planning in order to ensure that we are defining the most attractive returns for those resources. And some, we make it to the point, Paul, that we have a better alternative to monetize, that may include divestment. But it's a dynamic resource base that is constantly being upgraded with new additions, pulling things out that we don't see as creating a value for the Corporation. And I'll give you one example by way of illustration. You think about the sizable Julia resource and how we've optimized that to a much smaller initial development in order to de-risk the overall resource size, that's the type of optimization that I'm talking about and based on that derisking it will there position us on future investment opportunities. Paul Cheng : Great. Second question, just some quick number, I think in a number of segments that you have some asset sales gain. Can you just give us what is the asset sales gain in the second quarter by segment and breakdown between U.S. and international and also tell us what is the Kearl current production in Phase 1 and Phase 2 separately? Jeff Woodbury : So in terms of the earnings impact from our asset sales in the second quarter, it was about $490 million. A majority of that, Paul, was in the Chemical business. In terms of Kearl, it's in total as I said is producing about 130 \u2013 or in the second quarter it was producing about 230,000 barrels per day. The Phase 1 or the initial development was around 100,000 barrels and Phase 2 was around 30,000 barrels. Paul Cheng : Jeff, do you have the latest number in July in the last couple, maybe a week or so, on Kearl? Jeff Woodbury : On Kearl, no, I don't have anything to share at this point. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Guess one question hasn't really been asked I'd like to get out there, oil prices this low, last time we had sustained lower for longer situation, lot of mergers in the space. I know you don't want to talk about anything specific but as a general sort of commentary on maybe the bid ask spread that's out there, the type of assets that might be interesting to axe on, if you could give us any clarity on that? Jeff Woodbury : Roger, that was similar to an earlier question. As I said earlier, I would just say that we keep alert to where we've got value propositions, and the way I clarify that is, you know bolt-on acquisitions that have natural synergies with our business, long-life assets that we think that our expertise in operating experience will bring intrinsic value associated with it, it's not focused on a specific resource type but it's really focused on where we think that our unique experiences can add value that others can't see. Roger Read : And on the bid ask spread, maybe how that's \u2013 if it's changed at all, if there's anything you can add there? Jeff Woodbury : Roger, I really don't have much to add on there. I mean that's really a function of the transactions. I mean that certainly staying in a lower price environment is going to encourage both buyers and sellers to find closure. Roger Read : Okay. And then as kind of the unrelated follow-up, in Guyana the big discovery, is there any sort of timeline at all we can be thinking about at this point for the next appraisal well and then if that goes, how you think about some of the other things including the I guess border dispute with Venezuela, et cetera? Jeff Woodbury : As I said, we're certainly very encouraged by the first well. It is one well in a very, very large block. We are currently evaluating that well and we're laying out, if you will, the plans moving forward. You can expect the intent for us to not only further appraise the discovery but pursue other opportunities on the block. I want to be clear though that we follow all the laws within the host countries and international law, that we're operating on this block on a license from the government at Guyana, and the border matters are really a function or should stay with the governments to address through appropriate channels. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Maybe if I could one follow-up on costs, I know you've talked about cost control efforts a couple of times already, but maybe not on the CapEx side but if we look on the OpEx side or the expense side of the Company, a lot of your competitors have talked about percentages in terms of year-over-year decreases and OpEx or targets in terms of absolute numbers that they think they can pull out of the business, I mean any guidance you can give us in terms of maybe where your cost structure might be year on year or how much you think you might be able to pull out on relative to the 2014 basis? Jeff Woodbury : Obviously our objective is to make sure that we're capturing all those opportunities, both structural and market out there, and at the same time ensuring that we maintain the high integrity of our operations. I think, Ryan, the ultimate measure here is our industry-leading unit cost performance that we've seen over the last several years, and while it's still early I don't want to go too far with this. We are seeing the unit cost on a downward trend year-to-date, almost 9% down from where we were last year, but that's about as far as I'll quantify at this point. Obviously this is a key element to ensuring that we remain a leader in unit profitability as well. Ryan Todd : Good, thank you. And maybe one question on LNG and thoughts over on the business, we've had a number of questions on spot pricing and trends, but if you look at \u2013 you've got a decent queue of potential development projects that could happen at some point over time, can you talk about maybe what would be the threshold that you would need to move forward on some of these projects? Is it local permitting, is it an effort on reducing costs in the industry and getting costs down to a place that's competitive, is it a wide bid ask spread between buyers and sellers right now, any thoughts in general I guess on your asset portfolio on LNG on the development side and what you're seeing in the market? Jeff Woodbury : Sure. Broadly speaking, as you know, LNG is a key component of our portfolio and it's an important part of our margin generation. As I said earlier, we've got a very good inventory and including in that inventory is a number of LNG projects and it's all based on our assessment. As I indicated that gas will grow by about 1.6% per year between now and 2040 and more specifically LNG demand will triple from 2010 to 2040. So that is the value proposition we're pursuing. We've got a number of projects moving forward concurrently. We're going to be very selective in what we invest in. To your question about what does it take to make it go forward, it's all the things you mentioned, it's making sure that we get a competitive cost structure, that we've got stable transparent fiscal terms to underpin a very capital intensive investment, and that's why we're progressing settlement at the same time. I would tell you that kind of the brownfield type expansions are probably going to be the lowest cost LNG add. By way of example, our Papua New Guinea project, just a phenomenal outcome, started up ahead of schedule, very, very good reliability, very well-positioned to compete in expansion should we identify sufficient resource, having the assets that we have in the U.S. positions us very well, Alaska, West Coast of Canada continue to progress. Those opportunities will require more of what we were talking about in terms of cost, in terms of fiscal terms, regulatory environment. So in short, what I'd say, Ryan, is that the demand projection is there, obviously we've got the capability to participate in that and we're very well-positioned with a very good inventory of high quality opportunities to meet that demand growth. Operator : We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Just looking at the Downstream business, there have been a lot of press reports and/or regulatory filings about a potential substantial expansion of Beaumont. I was wondering if you could comment on that, provide any color around the thinking there? Jeff Woodbury : So just again, taking a portfolio look, Brad, we regularly evaluate our assets, our various business lines for where we can grow earnings or optimize the long-term value of it, and in the Downstream business it's focused in the following areas; expanding our logistics, expanding our feedstock, reducing our overall cost structure, and importantly increasing high-value product yields. You'll see that one of those areas or one or more of those areas will underpin the investment projects that we have communicated have been through FID, such as the [indiscernible] investment. As it pertains to Beaumont, we typically assess those activities. I understand that that may include some discussions with the regulators. It doesn't indicate that we have made a decision and when we get close to an FID and we've made that decision, we'll communicate that accordingly. Brad Heffern : Okay, I understood. And then looking in California on the Upstream side, I was curious what the impact during the quarter was given the planned pipeline downtime and what the outlook is there? Jeff Woodbury : Good question, Ryan. I mean as you all know, the planned All American Pipeline was down due to a failure of the line in the second quarter. We've looked for options to go ahead and keep our facility on without that pipeline running or until we are able to find an alternative export route as while it will be shut down. Before it was shut down, it was producing somewhere around 30,000 barrels a day. In fact that was a 2014 number. So we'll keep focused on it, we'll keep working with the regulator as well as the All American Pipeline to identify the earliest restart. Operator : We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with Tudor, Pickering & Holt Co. Anish Kapadia : First question is, just looking at some of the great projects again that surpass 2018, it seems to me like you focused on three key areas or things if you like which is getting more challenged over the next few years, so when you look at international LNG, seems to be a little more competition coming in from domestic U.S. LNG. When you look at your oilsands projects, they are relatively high cost and impacted by potential carbon pricing and higher taxes coming through. In Nigeria, clearly a difficult political environment there and tax uncertainty. Just wondering, given those as kind of your key areas, how comfortable are you with those areas and the potential growth there? Jeff Woodbury : Anish, we're in the risk management business. Everything that we do has a level of risk that we've got to judge, whether it would be geopolitical risk, economic risk, technical uncertainty, and that is the world we live in, and I think the organization has demonstrated over the years that it's got the expertise and the capabilities to take on these more challenging resources and convert them into value propositions for our shareholders. So the areas you talked about, I mean take a look at Papua New Guinea LNG, I mean no infrastructure, we were able to build that into a very successful project that's going to supply an important part of LNG demand in the future. We have a good track record in all these areas, we're very good at capturing the learnings and transporting those learnings into our future resource development activities to make sure that we maximize return, and as I said to Paul earlier, if we don't see the value proposition there, we will find other ways to monetise that asset, Anish Kapadia : Okay, great. And just a follow-on, in terms of your future projects, I'm just thinking, how you think about delaying projects in an attempt to in this kind of falling kind of service price environment to capture lower prices, is that something that you're actively kind of looking to do or would you just go ahead with the projects as it kind of make sense in terms of the economics at the moment? Jeff Woodbury : I mean remember these projects that you referenced earlier are multi-year projects, they happen over a period of time and we are looking for not only the market savings but I'll stress again the structural savings. Let me use an example of what I'm talking about. We went forward with both the Arkutun-Dagi and the Hebron developments concurrently because we saw a very consistent development option and the tremendous benefit that we'd get by learning curve advantages. So both GBS, we used a comparable design shop for both of them, we used the same GBS contractor, we used the same topside contractor, and we captured that immediate learning curve benefit. On top of that, in a lower price cycle as I said earlier, we're very well positioned with the global procurement organization to be first in line in capturing those market savings, and given our long-term investment and our expectation of what demand is going to do, we're very confident that over the timeframe \u2013 the things we're investing in today, some of them we won't see production on for five or 10 years. We're very confident in our demand projections, in our ability to turn that into accretive financial performance. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : When I hear what you're saying about costs and potential M&A, and knowing what you said in the past about the Permian, it feels like that's the best opportunity for you to combine the overlap that you have with the potential to drive out costs. I think you've highlighted that it's a very fragmented zone. And I would also think that the Bakken is similar. But you really don't have a lot in the Eagle Ford. So my assumption is that essentially the Permian would be the most attractive place for you and then the Bakken to take advantage of this low price environment. Jeff Woodbury : Paul, just broadly speaking, we keep focused globally and we've got those type of opportunities in other countries that will naturally maintain a line of sight on should the right value proposition come forward. If you want to focus in them, conventional, certainly the ownership structure in the Permian by way of example is very, very diverse and where we can find natural synergies. I mean over the last several years we've made a number of bolt-on acquisitions that have increased our position there and you get a value uplift when we're able to do that where it's within our operational structure. Paul Sankey : Yes, and I guess the operational structure is well suited because of the XTO separate division you have gives you the flexibility? Jeff Woodbury : That's correct. Paul Sankey : One thing I'm worried about, Jeff, is with the replacement, just in as far as I don't think you've had any FIDs this year, [indiscernible] just that your business bookings last year were heavily dominated by the U.S., could you update us on where we stand as regards with those replacements? Jeff Woodbury : Obviously that's an annual process and we've fully replaced our production for 21 straight years. We've got a very good inventory that we're working on to convert to an FID decision and proved reserves as well as very active exploration program. So we've been very successful as the history shows and I'd say that the prognosis in the future will remain the same. Paul Sankey : Jeff, do you know how many FIDs you had last year? Jeff Woodbury : Not off the top of my head, Paul, no. Operator : We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Thanks for your comment on operating costs earlier. Can you give us some sort of magnitude about how much of that 9% you might feel is natural deflation in the environment, like energy prices, and how much is your in cost management? Jeff Woodbury : Alastair, I'd just tell you that the organization wants to keep focused on the structural improvements as well as net market capture. Everything is under focus constantly, even when we're at $100 per barrel, but I don't have any specific numbers to breakout on the benefit today. Alastair Syme : And secondly, in the Chemicals business in this environment, you've seen that difference in the profitability between the base and derivative businesses? Jeff Woodbury : Remember it's all premised under very strong demand growth and our investments are strategically placed in order to make sure that we can compete competitively over that timeframe. I think we're very well-positioned in both the commodity and specialties markets. Operator : We'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Guy Baber : Jeff, you highlighted on Slide 18, Lower 48 onshore F&D cost, best in class by a substantial margin. I believe those costs have been declining in recent years as well and likely continue to decline. So I was just wondering if you could discuss how that positive trend for U.S. Lower 48 F&D compares to the trends that you're seeing internationally and that you've seen in recent years, where it appears F&D for the industry has risen considerably in some cases. So can you just discuss your thoughts on that emergence, what you're seeing, and also how that might influence capital allocation and strategy long-term, so specifically does it leads you to believe you need to find a way to allocate more capital to the regions where you can most efficiently add reserves, which appears to be the U.S.? Jeff Woodbury : I think it's an excellent question, Guy, because I think this is just one example of what we do across our whole global portfolio. I talked about by way of another example, we've shown you the XTO example. In my prepared comments, I talked about Erha North Phase 2. Last quarter I talked about the start-up of Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, but that's another really good example that instead of \u2013 that we sequenced the resource development in a manner that we can fully leverage the fixed investment over a period of time, and what that does is that lowers our overall cost structure or E&D costs globally, and in a deepwater environment where we've got to be very careful that we've got very good execution plans and that we execute flawlessly. So it's a very strong focus across the world whether it's in the deepwater with Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 and Erha North Phase 2 or we're talking about the Arctic or sub-Arctic like in Arkutun-Dagi and Hebron, there is an ongoing emphasis to try to get that cost structure down. And that's why I made the point earlier that this is something that we have to work 365 days a year, it's not something that's driven by the price environment, it's driven by the need to be ever more productive and to compete in a market that you know there's a lot investment dollars going in. So we keep line of sight on where we've got cost opportunities. Guy Baber : Thanks Jeff. And last one for me, liquids production up 12% on the year, so obviously very impressive growth, major projects ramping up, you get some PSC benefit obviously, but it also appears like you're showing growth in some areas where you don't have high-profile major projects, North Sea oil for example, but it appears that reliability uptime maybe improving just across the portfolio. Is that an accurate observation and is there any detail you can provide of how the base level of production is performing perhaps relative to expectations coming into the year because it seems to be doing better? Jeff Woodbury : It's another good question and you may recall back in the Analyst presentation, we spent a little bit of time, the Chairman showed a chart that tries to \u2013 goes to quantify the volume add that we make with our focus on reliability. We are making very significant gains on improving overall operating reliability, and I'll emphasize, not only in the Upstream but also across our manufacturing business as well. As we focus intensely on cost structure, we do the same on uptime and reliability, and really try to transfer those learnings quickly across the Corporation to make sure that once again we're best in class. Operator : Our final question for today comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John Herrlin : Most things have been asked here but you've seen a lot of your [IFC] [ph] peers as well as some large cap E&Ps take significant impairments. You have a very robust resource base, as you've stated. Are there any issues for say intermediate-term projects coming off the books on a long-term basis for Exxon? Jeff Woodbury : There's two parts to your question. One is, if we've got resources that are in a resource base that ultimately we don't see the long-term value, as I indicated earlier, John, we will look for ways to monetize them which may include some level of divestment. In terms specifically of impairments, as you know we live in a commodity price environment that has great volatility but as I've said several times in our energy outlook, the long-term market fundamentals remain unchanged, and the lifespan of our assets are measured really in decades, therefore our long-term price views are more stable and quite frankly more meaningful for future cash flows and market value. So we expect the business to more than recover the carrying value of the assets on the books. Obviously in the course of our ongoing asset management efforts, we do confirm that asset values fully cover carrying costs. John Herrlin : Great, that's what I wanted to hear. One last one for me, which you probably won't answer, Guyana insignificant, you want to attach a volume sense to that? Jeff Woodbury : John, I think it's just too early. I look forward to that done, I can have more discussion about it as well, but as I said John, one well in a 6.6 million acre block, it's a very good start and just watch that space. There's more to be said there I think. Operator : With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back to our host for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Woodbury : To conclude, again I want to thank you for your time and your very thoughtful and insightful questions this morning. We appreciate the opportunity to talk about the business and really share the successes of our people that work day in and day out to make sure that we're creating shareholder value. So thanks again and we look forward to further discussion in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining.",

Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and once again welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. And as you know, before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two. Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated earnings of $4.2 billion in the third quarter. We maintain a relentless focus on our business fundamentals, including cost management, regardless of the commodity price cycle. Despite the challenging environment, the corporation also continues to deliver on its investment and operating commitments. Third quarter results reflect cyclical strength in our downstream and chemicals segments and highlight the resilience of our integrated business model. The corporation's integrated cash flows underpin our dividend and enable investment through the cycle to grow shareholder value. Year to date, the corporation generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion, with positive free cash flow of $7.4 billion, even amid sharply lower commodity prices. Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth slowed during the third quarter. In the U.S., growth tapered following a strong second quarter. China's economy continued to decelerate, and the recovery in Japan remained weak. However, there is some evidence of economic stabilization in Europe. Crude oil prices resumed their decline after improving in the second quarter, whereas global refining margins strengthened during the quarter. And in chemicals, both commodity and specialty product margins also improved. Turning to the financial results, as shown on slide five, as indicated, third quarter earnings were $4.2 billion, or just over $1.00 per share. The corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $500 million were used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.7 billion, benefiting from ongoing capital efficiencies as well as additional captured savings in the current market environment. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.7 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.3 billion, and debt was $34.3 billion. The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of funds. So over the quarter, cash decreased marginally from $4.4 billion to $4.3 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $9.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments in the business of $6.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. There was no net cash flow impact from debt and other financing items. As you can see on the chart, the corporation fully funded all shareholder distributions and net investments with cash flow from operations and asset sales in the quarter, with a marginal decrease to the cash balance. Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were down $3.8 billion from the year-ago quarter, though our upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger downstream results and lower corporate costs. As shown on slide eight, the results were comparable to the second quarter, as lower upstream earnings offset stronger downstream results and lower corporate costs. Now on average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the near term. Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, upstream earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion, down $5.1 billion from the third quarter of 2014. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by $5.1 billion, while crude realizations declined more than $50 per barrel, and gas was down more than $2.00 per 1,000 cubic feet. Note that favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings $110 million, driven by new project developments. All other items reduced earnings by $70 million, where the absence of asset management gains were partly offset by lower operating expenses. Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 87,000 barrels per day or 2.3% compared to the third quarter of last year. Liquids production increased 266,000 barrels per day or nearly 13%, driven by project ramp-up and entitlement effects. Natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, primarily in North America. Turning now to the sequential comparisons, starting on slide 11, upstream earnings were $673 million lower than the second quarter. Weaker liquids realizations reduced earnings $1.2 billion, as crude prices were over $12 per barrel lower than the second quarter. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings $30 million. All other items increased earnings $550 million, reflecting favorable foreign exchange effects, lower operating costs, and the absence of the deferred tax adjustment associated with the Alberta tax rate increase. Upstream unit profitability for the third quarter was $3.88 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Year-to-date earnings per barrel were $5.81. Moving to slide 12, sequentially volumes decreased 61,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.5%. Liquids production, however, increased 40,000 barrels per day, as new project growth and work programs were partly offset by scheduled maintenance and field decline. Natural gas production was 604 million cubic feet per day lower than the second quarter, driven by entitlement effects, weaker seasonal demand in Europe, and field decline. Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $2 billion, up $1 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Our margins increased earnings by $1.4 billion. Volume and other impacts reduced earnings $280 million and $110 million respectively, primarily driven by higher maintenance activity, mostly in the U.S. Turning to slide 14, sequentially downstream earnings were up $527 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $320 million, and higher volumes from lower maintenance activity contributed another $270 million. Other items reduced earnings by $60 million. Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15, third quarter chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Improved margins contributed $210 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $30 million. And all other items decreased earnings by $210 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Moving to slide 16, chemical earnings were also flat sequentially. Stronger margins increased earnings $160 million, while favorable sales mix added $40 million. Other items reduced earnings $220 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains. Now on slide 17, we want to reinforce the importance of the corporation's focus on business fundamentals regardless of commodity prices, and this focus underpins our solid financial and operating results throughout the business cycle. Our first imperative is operational integrity, ensuring safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible operations, founded on strong risk management. Next, we work to maximize the value of our assets by increasing facility utilization and reliability. An incremental barrel of oil produced or refined through improved reliability is one of the most profitable. The next imperative is cost management. Reducing our cost structure is an ongoing focus in our existing operations and new developments. We also continuously enhance and right-size our global functional organization, capturing benefits from economies of scale, shared research and development programs and technologies, shared services, and common best practices. We currently run ExxonMobil with about the same number of employees as Exxon had just prior to the merger with Mobil. We are also quick to capture market cost savings. Our global procurement organization is dedicated to capturing the lowest lifecycle costs for goods and services. As you can see in the chart on the left, we are achieving significant market savings in the current business climate. So far this year, we've achieved a net reduction of $8 billion in capital and cash operating costs. And I'll note that this amount is in addition to the $4.5 billion decrease in planned 2015 CapEx relative to 2014 spend. Further in the upstream, unit costs are down about 10% year to date compared to last year. And finally, our longstanding track record of superior project execution is a distinguishing characteristic of ExxonMobil, and results in higher-return capital-efficient assets due to a lower capital base and on-time delivery. Turning to slide 18, through our differentiated project development capability, we are unlocking the value of our deep and diverse upstream portfolio. Excellent progress has been made on our investment plans to start up 32 major projects between 2012 and 2017. We've started up 21 of these projects, including five this year, which added more than 750,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. More than 90% of these volumes are liquids or liquids linked to LNG. We are achieving a strong reliability from our projects, including more recent startups such as Kizomba Satellites Phase 2 in Angola, Hadrian South in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Kearl expansion in Canada. The Papua New Guinea LNG project continues to achieve exceptional results. From its early startup in 2014 and quick ramp up to full capacity, the project has produced nearly 9 million gross tons of high-quality LNG and has delivered more than 125 cargoes to customers. Now since startup, we have progressed low-cost debottlenecking activities to enhance production rates. Our systematic approach has increased gross capacity of the PNG LNG project from 6.9 million to 7.3 million tons per year. This is yet another example of ExxonMobil's constant focus on maximizing the value of installed capacity and improving profitability. Two additional capital-efficient projects were commissioned in September. In Nigeria, Erha North Phase 2 started up five months ahead of schedule and $400 million under budget. This subsea development ties back to existing infrastructure, shown in the photo, avoiding the need for another FPSO vessel. Gross peak production is estimated at 65,000 barrels of oil per day and will increase total Erha North field production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day. Also in September, the first ever subsea compression facility started up at \u00c5sgard in the Norwegian North Sea at a depth of nearly 1,000 feet. This is a prime example of developing and applying advanced technologies to unlock previously uneconomic reserves. At peak, the project is expected to add gross production of approximately 40,000 barrels of oil and more than 400 million cubic feet of gas per day. And finally in Indonesia, at the Banyu Urip development, startup of the central processing facility is expected by year end, enabling gross production to ramp up to more than 200,000 barrels per day. Moving now to exploration on slide 19, we continue high-grading our 92 billion barrel resource base through new opportunity captures and leveraging the benefits of a softer market as we progress our exploration activities. Offshore Guyana, we are conducting the largest 3-D seismic survey in the company's history to evaluate the resource potential of the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block. Additional exploration drilling is planned in the first half of 2016. Offshore Nigeria, we secured interests in two high-potential blocks, building upon our 800,000 acre position. These blocks are adjacent to where we made two discoveries last year. Future developments could tie back to the nearby Usan FPSO, which is operated by ExxonMobil. And in the U.S. Permian, we acquired rights to 48,000 acres in the core of the Midland Basin adjacent to existing operations. We have grown our operated portfolio in the basin to over 135,000 net acres from a series of acquisitions during the last two years. Turning to slide 20 and an update on our downstream business, where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales, we recently announced the expansion of our hydrocracker unit at the Rotterdam refinery, shown in the picture to the left. The project will utilize ExxonMobil's proprietary hydrocracking technology, efficiently producing Group II premium lube-based stocks and ultra-low-sulfur diesel to meet growing market demand. The Rotterdam refinery is fully integrated with our chemical manufacturing. The hydrocracker project will increase production of higher-value products and further strengthen the refinery's position as a leader in the European refining industry. Construction is expected to begin in 2016, with startup projected in 2018. This project along with recently completed basestock capacity expansions at our Baytown, Texas and Singapore refineries will further enhance our position as the world's largest producer of lube-based stocks. Now in addition to these capacity expansions, we are investing across our lubricants value chain. At our petrochemical complex in Singapore, we announced the construction of a new synthetic lubricant blending plant to extend the production of Mobil 1, our flagship synthetic engine oil brand. This new plant will employ innovative blending technologies, drive increased operating efficiency, and enable us to support the growing Asian market demand for premium synthetic lubricants. Startup has been planned in 2017. Moving now to a discussion of year-to-date cash flow on slide 21, this graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash. Our integrated businesses provided $26 billion of cash flow from operations, which supports shareholder distributions and funds our investments. The scale of these cash flows and our balance sheet strength provide the financial flexibility to invest through the cycle. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion funded shareholder distributions and nearly all of our net investments in the business, supplemented by a small increase in debt financing. These investments have attractive financial returns and justify the additional leverage. Our objective is to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.73 are up 5.8% versus the third quarter of 2014. We have also maintained the share buyback program, but have prudently tapered it over the past nine months, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to remain at $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. And finally, year to date, the corporation has generated $7.4 billion free cash flow, reflecting the performance of our integrated businesses and our disciplined capital allocation approach. So I would now like to conclude this morning's comments with just a summary of our year-to-date performance. In short, the corporation is delivering on its investment and operating commitments. Through the end of the third quarter, ExxonMobil earned $13.4 billion, reflecting the benefits of our integrated business model, which captures value throughout the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong downstream and chemical results. Upstream production volumes increased to 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up 2.7% year on year. Volume contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. We remain on track to achieve our production target of 4.1 million barrels per day for the full year, with additional project ramp-up and seasonal gas production increases throughout the fourth quarter. Solid operating results combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $27.6 billion and free cash flow of $7.4 billion. Our commitment to shareholders remains strong, as the corporation distributed $11.5 billion through the end of the third quarter. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. This concludes my prepared remarks, and I certainly would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, everyone. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : A couple, one housekeeping and one strategic question, if I may. Just on housekeeping. This quarter I guess the number that jumped out to us was your tax rate, and I'm just trying to understand. Is that just a mix effect, or is there anything thing unusual going on there that we should be aware of? Put another way, if we had a sustained low oil price environment, I'm guessing we would expect that the tax rate would remain at depressed levels. Is that fair? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, well, the tax rate, if you think about it from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, Doug, it's down just shy of 12%, and there are two components. One, as you said, is the mix effect across our business segments and geographies, same as what you've heard from us the prior quarters. There was also a one-time tax-related item that reduced the tax rate by about 3%. So we're still consistent with our guidance that assuming the current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we would anticipate an effective tax rate between 35% and 40%. If you unwind the 3% one-time impact in the third quarter, that takes you up to 35%. And if you look at year to date, our effective tax rate is about 37%. So our guidance of 35% to 40% is right on. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : To be clear, that's a consolidated rate, or does that include affiliates? That's just consolidated, right? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : That's consolidated. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, okay. My follow-up is I guess I'm going to go with Guyana. So one of your partners is suggesting that there's a reasonable potential for an early production system here, and I'm just wondering. Given as operator, you're the source of all knowledge, so to speak, can you give us some idea as to how you're thinking internally about scale opportunity given just the embryonic nature of this whole situation? Although there's an early production system plan, and I know there are a lot of embedded questions there. But the relative importance that Exxon is giving this within your general portfolio in terms of personnel allocation and things of that nature, just a broad feel as to how you're thinking about what looks like a fairly interesting area. I'll leave it there, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Sure, Doug. Let me step back first and just remind you. The exploration program as a whole is really designed to ensure that we're targeting opportunities that will high-grade our resource portfolio. As you heard from us earlier this year, we're very encouraged with the initial result of Guyana. As I've said previously, Doug, and as you seemed to imply, we've got one well in an area that's very large, 6.6 million acres. We're very encouraged by the initial results. As I said in my prepared comments, we do have a very active seismic program underway that is informing us as we put together our plans for some drilling activity in the first half. Obviously, we're taking all that information real time and we're incorporating it into our thinking. But it is really too early for us to share any specific plans. But rest assured, Doug. We will look at the full range of development options to see how we can best monetize the resource with the objective of achieving optimized return on investment. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate the answer. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : So I have a point of clarification as well. What was the asset sale that was highlighted on slide six? And was this $500 million after-tax amount included in the operating earnings; that is, in the $1.01 per share? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : So the $500 million from cash flow represents a number of multiple assets. As we've said historically, Doug, we have as part of a key component of our business is a very active asset management plan to high-grade our portfolio. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Sure. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : So the $500 million positive cash impact really represents many different transactions that occurred over the quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, it was the absence of a trade that we did third quarter of last year. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay, I see. And also on capital spending, it's running about 20% below last year's level. And while the gap seems to have narrowed somewhat versus the recent quarters, it actually widened versus the first half in the upstream. So my question is whether or not you could provide some color on the spending trends and also any insight that you may have on the trend for 2016 in light of the pretty significant changes that are being announced by some of your competitors; that is, if you have any guidance at this point. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Sure, Doug. I'll say in short that our CapEx guidance has not been changed. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : We're still saying \u2013 have guidance for this year at $34 billion, and 2016 and 2017 below $34 billion. Of course, we'll provide an update in the analyst meeting in March. But as I alluded to last quarter and you see in the savings I talked about year to date, we are seeing substantial capital efficiencies on the CapEx side. We are running lower than our plan, and it is reasonable to extrapolate that to a year-end number that will bring us below our $34 billion. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : And thinking forward, Doug, I'd also say that those type of efficiencies and improvements that we're capturing, including market savings and a stronger U.S. dollar, will be extrapolated forward into the 2016 and 2017 programs. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Brad. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just following up on the past question, obviously you identified $8 billion in cost savings so far. I'm curious what inning we're in, if you will, as far as cost savings go. Do you feel like you've harvested the majority of savings that you expect to have as a result of the downturn, or is there a lot more to come? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Brad, I think just stepping back, we are never satisfied with our cost structure. We are, as was clearly mentioned many times, we're always working to reduce the structural cost in our business. So I would never tell you that we're done. Within the market capture, the market benefits, we continue to work actively with our service providers to identify innovative lower-cost solutions that end up being win-win solutions outcomes because they know we've got the financial capability to invest if we have the right cost structure and ultimately the right economics. So we're actively pursuing additional opportunities, and our expectation is that we'll continue to drive meaningful improvement in our cost structure while maintaining high operational integrity. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks for that. And then thinking about onshore U.S., can you talk about the current rig count across your three major basins? There was obviously a big decline last quarter. Can you talk through how much of \u2013 if it's declined further, how much of that is just pure efficiencies versus the amount of activity you'd like to have? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : It's probably both of that. It's both efficiency as well as an intentional effort to manage our spend given the business climate. Right now, currently we've got running about 32 rigs in our Lower 48 onshore rig activity. That is down from our peak. And you know, in essence, it's down because of the reasons I've already stated, and that is we continue to see significant improvements in operational performance, cost, and productivity. So while the rig count is down, part of that is offset by the improvement in performance. But the second part of it again is due to a deliberate effort to manage within our means. Bradley B. Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Hi, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just first to follow up on the CapEx, on the $8 billion of cost savings year to date, can you give us color of the composition in that reduction between capital and cash costs? I thought I heard you say that's in addition to the $4.5 billion step-down from 2014 to 2015. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, Evan. It is in addition to the $4.5 billion. So the $8 billion is really from our target, our CapEx guidance that we had provided. In terms of the split between CapEx and OpEx, generally speaking, I'd just tell you it's a little over $1 billion CapEx. The rest is OpEx, cash OpEx. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it; that helps as we think about 2016. And my second question is on LNG. I know there's a mix in contract durations within your global LNG portfolio, and it changes over time as contracts, some contracts reopen as had been reported. But can you quantify the aggregate spot market exposure in your portfolio for Exxon into 2016? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I can generally tell you that it's a fairly low component of our portfolio. Remember, our LNG projects continue to be a key component of our portfolio, and it is a very important part of our margin generation. And as you may have heard us say in the past, when we go to FID on these big multibillion dollar complex LNG projects, we typically contract under long terms our LNG volumes, our proved LNG or proved reserves, with a very little bit left for spot. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So less than 10%, is that a fair assumption? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : That's a fair assumption. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Phil. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just a quick follow-up on the capital cost reduction number. Would you say that there has been a significant impact this year to pulling forward any capital spending to take advantage of this environment that as we look ahead to next year, you could actually have a good year-over-year benefit from that? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, clearly the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to continue to invest through the cycle provides an added benefit. Those projects that are in execution right now coupled with the capability of our global procurement organization to capture market savings allows us to leverage those benefits in the current projects. Likewise, if you rewind a bit to our discussion around the Lower 48 unconventional activity, we are taking full advantage of high-grading the services that were provided. We're very well positioned to advance certain commodity purchases, but rest assured we're taking full benefit of the current market climate. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is there any way to quantify the benefit of pull-forward plus project roll-off? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : No, Phil, it's really hard to do that. The business is very expansive in terms of scope and scale. A lot of those cost savings vary dramatically between asset and geographic regions. So it's really difficult for us to go ahead and break that down further. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, understood. And my follow-up question is just on the M&A bid/ask spreads. Other companies have sounded a bit more upbeat. I know in the past you've said you think they're too wide still. So has anything changed there in the past few months? And with respect to how wide they've been for how long, has that surprised you at all given where we are in the cycle relative to past cycles? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : All I can really say about it is as you would envision. The bid/ask price is really a function of a number of factors, obviously including the business climate. But also what I would tell you is the unique capability and assessment from individual investors. Certainly as commodity prices remain low, it will impact the dynamics. I really don't have a view to share with respect to where it's going. I would tell you from our perspective, it's business as normal. As you've heard me say several times, Phil, this is a key component of our ongoing business, not only acquisitions but high-grading our portfolio from divestments. I would simply just say that any acquisition will have to compete with our diverse inventory of investment opportunities. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Neil. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Jeff, I wanted you to comment a little bit on the downstream here. And maybe we start off with some of the announced divestments, Chalmette and Torrance. Talk through a little bit of the strategic logic behind divesting those assets, and then what we can read, if any, from how you think about the downstream portfolio as a percentage as the mix of the company. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Sure, Neil. Maybe I can start with just a reminder for the group that, as I said a moment ago, this is a very important part of our overall business activities, the asset management focus. And from a downstream perspective, if you look at the last decade, we have divested more than 1 million barrels a day of refining capacity, something like 6,000 miles of pipeline, and over 200 fuel terminals. And I start there because it just highlights that we continue to high-grade the portfolio. And it really talks to our effort towards enhancing our portfolio through identifying appropriate investment opportunities like you're seeing in Rotterdam, in Singapore, focusing on risk balancing on our portfolio, and then pursuing monetization opportunities. Obviously, there are a lot of variables that go into such a decision for the downstream, including our large manufacturing footprint in the U.S. But ultimately the right decision for us was to monetize those assets and to continue to focus our investments on areas that will upgrade our existing portfolio. Many of our sites being advantaged, a lot of those investments focused on things like expanding our feedstock flexibility, like you see in our plans to expand the Beaumont refinery, like expanding our logistics flexibility like we talked about previously with the Edmonton rail terminal. Expanding our higher-yield, higher-value products, which you're seeing with the Rotterdam refinery and the Antwerp refinery. And underlying all of that is further capturing increased value from our integrated business model. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then the follow-up question, Jeff, is a follow-up to Phil's question around M&A. And as you think about the U.S. unconventional business, you did a tuck-in here of 48,000 acres in the Permian. Is that the right strategy for Exxon to continue to look for incremental bolt-on acquisitions of acreage that you can tuck into the portfolio under XTO, or does larger-scale M&A of U.S. conventional assets create value at the right price? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : We think it is the right strategy. We think everything is available for us to consider. It will be a full range from our investment activity to the bolt-on acquisitions that you've seen us do here in the Lower 48 unconventional in the last two years, to larger-scale acquisitions where fundamentally it keeps on going back to that test. It has to compete with the investment opportunities that we have in our portfolio. And if the view is that we can capture additional strategic value, and overall our assessment is that we'll capture longer-term accretive performance, then it really sets up the stage for something that we'd be interested in. And remember, we keep that financial capability so that we are agile to respond to opportunities that come along. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Makes sense. Thank you very much, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jeff, two questions, if I may, one a quick one, just a clarification on the quarter. Maybe I missed it. Did you tell us what is the actual asset sales gain on the P&L in this quarter, and also whether there's any timing benefit value from the price realization for your downstream? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : On the first question, Paul, what I said was there really is \u2013 from an earnings impact, there's really nothing for us to share. There's nothing notable across the transactions. Your second question, can you repeat that again? Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's part of the first question, is that do you have \u2013 typically when you buy crude, because of the long haul, sometimes when oil price is dropping that you have a price realization benefit on the finalization. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Do you have that number you can share with us? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, so quarter on quarter it's a negative about $100 million. Sequentially, it's negative about $200 million. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So sequentially it's about $200 million negative. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : That's correct. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A second question is maybe more strategic. If I look at your portfolio, say broadly divide it into deepwater, oil sands, shale oil, and LNG, when you look at those buckets, can you rank for us that in terms of the attractiveness of future investment within your portfolio on those buckets? In other words, which one is weighing the highest, and which one is the lowest in your portfolio today? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Paul, I'd ask you to think about it a little bit differently; that within each one of those resource types, there is a range of attractiveness in terms of value. We may have some very attractive resources in each one of those categories that would compete very effectively with other high-value resources within another bucket. Quite frankly, what's really important here that I'd ask you to think about is that we have a very diverse and deep resource base that we are able to participate in each one of those resource categories. And within those resource categories, we've got very high-value investment opportunities that will effectively compete for allocation of capital. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, that's fair. Maybe let me ask from another angle then. Out of the 98 billion barrels of your resource, do you have a rough estimate how much of them based on today's technology and the physical term you would be able to generate more than a 10% return under a $60 Brent? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : On the 92 billion barrel resource base, again, I'd ask you think about it differently because what the organization does is we will continue to optimize our development alternatives to make sure that we maximize the return on these barrels. So if we identify a resource that we don't think we can get an attractive return on, there will be other means to go ahead and either implement a different development scheme that will reduce the economic risk and improve the return, or ultimately we may choose to go ahead and monetize the asset. So it's a dynamic portfolio that is really working towards getting the greatest value from every barrel. And then of course, we complement that with our application of technology. I'd just use the unconventionals as a good example about how technology has really increased the value of the unconventional resources. Another good example is in oil sands, how technology is being applied to really improve the profitability and allow us to capture greater value from those resources. So I think it really speaks to the strengths of ExxonMobil. We have the knowhow. We've got the excellence in how we go ahead and do our development planning, how we identify value-added real-time technology to enhance our investment choices, and then of course, leveraging our ability to interface with the resource owners to find the right fiscal environment to go ahead and progress the investments. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, very good. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Operator : Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company has our next question. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Morning, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: So on the last call there was a little bit of inquiry about growth opportunities post this round of guidance in 2018. It strikes me that sort of U.S. gas is a really big component of your resource base without pulling much weight in income today, and perhaps there's an opportunity for that slug of resource to provide some of that outer year growth. I was wondering if you could just maybe walk us through your broader views on gas, specifically any kind of path you see for that tranche of production to start contributing a little bit more to the overall income profile. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Sure. Let's start, Sam, with our energy outlook. If you think about the energy outlook, gas is growing about 1.6% per year. From an LNG perspective, from where we are, say, 2010 to 2040, we expect LNG demand to triple from current capacity. So that really sets up, if you will, the investment case. And then globally, we're very well positioned with gas assets around the globe to participate not only in the domestic market but in the LNG market. So maybe if I can focus now on just the U.S. for a moment, we have had a constructive view that gas is going to continue to grow in the U.S. as gas replaces coal for power generation. Our gas resource base is also significantly underpinning our investment in our petrochemicals. So our expansion, for instance, at the Baytown refinery to add ethylene lines, 1.5 million tons per annum, as well as a concurrent investment at Mont Belvieu to add polyethylene lines, in fact, metallocene polyethylene, will be underpinned by an advantaged feedstock that is U.S. natural gas. And then furthermore, it also positions us to provide a source for LNG export into the global market. By way of example, we're progressing through a regulatory review of the Golden Pass LNG export facility. Think of it as a brownfield development because all the original investment associated with the export facility is going to be advantaging that site as we move forward into an export facility. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, so that brings me to my follow-up, I guess. How much of your investment evaluation process is geared around integrating some of the resources that you have in place? So for example, as you see U.S. gas here get pressured in the near term from improved economics from unconventional producers, would that ever lead you to accelerate your investment in things like ethylene crackers or even U.S. LNG facilities to promote your own position? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I think it's a good question, Sam. Think about it this way; that we will time the investment in gas resource development activities to underpin value chain opportunities that we're pursuing. That is expansion into petrochemicals. That would be the LNG export. We will time those resource development activities to underpin the value chain investments that we're pursuing. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Perfect, thank you very much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Sam. Operator : We'll go next to Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Jeff, hey. Good morning. Question for you, a lot of your peers have been recognizing impairments and restructuring charges I guess partially as a function of head count reductions and OpEx reductions, and then secondly resetting internal price decks. I was wondering if you could remind me. Is there a certain timeline that Exxon uses to reset the internal deck that they're using? And then secondly, with some of these operating cost reductions that you're seeing, is part of that head count related, in which case we may see some restructuring charges? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : We don't have any plans, Blake, to have any restructuring charges. As I said in the prepared comments, we have really focused on right-sizing the organization through our history. Particularly, if you reference the merger of Exxon and Mobil to where we are today, we're down over 30% in terms of total employees. So we are constantly right-sizing that organization and identifying additional opportunities to improve the productivity of the organization as a whole. So we don't anticipate any restructuring charges. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay. And it doesn't sound like there's a timeline on internal price forecasts or anything like that, like some companies use the third quarter or something like that. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I'll go back to talking about our \u2013 what really informs us is our outlook on supply and demand. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay. Okay, the second question for you, very briefly, a lot of companies are starting to see lower decline rates as a function of increased reliability or some of the longer plateau projects coming online. This may be a better question for the Analyst Day, but I didn't know if you're witnessing the same thing in your portfolio. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Generally speaking, if you look at our 10-K, we have continued to update our, if you will, average decline rate over the long term, which is still about 3%. That does not include uplift due to major new project developments. But we have continued to invest in some very long-life assets that have really very long plateau production rates, like Kearl, like the LNG investments we've made in Papua New Guinea and in Qatar. That gives a very strong foundation to our production, but importantly, a valuable foundation that contributes significant cash flow. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet, Blake. Operator : We'll go next to Anish Kapadia with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Hi. My question is going back somewhat to the industry cost-cutting and CapEx cutting that you're seeing, and it seems like some other companies are cutting a lot more aggressively than yourselves given the state that some of those companies' balance sheets are in. I was just wondering. On the back of that, when would you expect that to have some kind of an impact on your non-operated production, given that we might see higher decline rates coming through with the lower number of infill wells being drilled, less tie-backs being put into place as projects get canceled? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Anish, that's a hard one to answer in terms of what others are going to do that results in volume impacts on our non-operated. Recognize that a large part of our portfolio is driven by long-life investments. These are multi-decade investments that are generating volumes over the long term. Granted there is a material component that's much more shorter-cycle investments, and we have seen some of the assets where we are not the operator, the activity drop off significantly because of weaker balance sheets. Of course, that may present an opportunity for us. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Okay, thank you. My second question was on your U.S. gas production. It seems like it's been fairly weak this quarter. It's down around 9% year over year. I think you had some benefit with Hadrian coming onstream. I'm just wondering in terms of that trend and that decline rate. Can you just give some kind of outlook of how you see your U.S. gas production progressing, especially in the current oil and gas price environment, and how you expect the gas price environment to evolve? What does that mean for your U.S. gas production? Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : A large part \u2013 I will remind you that a large part of our gas is coming from our unconventional resources. We are the largest gas producer in the U.S. We have not been investing in drilling activity here very significantly, primarily given the outlook for near-term gas demand. And as I said earlier, we're going to pace the investment program consistent with expected demand growth for conversion from coal to natural gas in power gen, the investment in petrochemicals, the regulatory approvals needed in order to export that gas and compete in the LNG market. Unfortunately, given certain regulatory restrictions in the U.S., that does slow down the investment opportunities, and I think it really points to the opportunity the U.S. has to more actively participate in the global market. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : That's great. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet. Operator : Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank has our next question. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe I can do one higher-level one first. If we think about project sanctions and your investment in long-cycle projects right now, where do you think you are in the deferral or reinvestment process? Have you seen costs come down to a level at this point on long-cycle projects where you feel like it's time to reaccelerate investment? Have you not deferred much in your view at this point? Or probably I guess what have you seen on FIDs? What FIDs could you expect going forward, or do you think that costs need to come down further for you to get reengaged? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Ryan, I guess I would tell you that we haven't disengaged. We've maintained an active investment program. In addition to the 32 major upstream projects that I've talked about and then the financial \u2013 FID decisions that we've taken on some of our downstream and chemical projects, we've given you some line of sight on the next tranche of upstream investment opportunities that are currently in various stages of either development planning or even in the early stages of pre-engineering, if you will. It gives you a sense for what we're working on. I want to remind you that we are capturing real-time benefits through capital efficiency in our investment program. Those are structural improvements that we're capturing. Yes, there are market improvements that we're experiencing as well. But as we make the investment decisions, we test those investments across a very wide range of prices, including commodity prices, and that's well within the current price environment. So the investments are very robust, resilient to a number of factors that can significantly influence them, and that positions us very well to continue a continuous investment program, not get the inefficiencies of the stop and the starts, obviously underpinned by our financial capability, and allows us to further capture economic uplift in the current market climate. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, that's helpful, and then maybe if I could ask one more specific one. On the last quarter you provided a little bit more granular production levels on some of your onshore assets, where they were in the quarter in the Permian, the Bakken, the Woodford. Would you be willing to say what those assets produced in the third quarter and maybe what your Midland Basin acreage is up to at this point? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : So the Midland Basin acreage, as I said in the prepared comments, we're up to 135,000 net acres. In terms of production or total gross operated production from the Permian, Bakken, and Woodford is just shy of 250,000 barrels a day. Bakken is leading that at over 100,000 barrels a day. Permian is approaching 100,000 barrels a day, and the rest is in the Woodford. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. It's getting to the top of the hour, so I'll leave my contentious one for the second question. First one, you mentioned you picked up extra acreage in Nigeria. Any signs that Nigeria is moving forward in terms of changing terms to get those attractive reservoirs actually development-flowing? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I think there's a clear recognition that there are some opportunities to stimulate further investment, technology application within the country. And I think there's an earnest effort to try to put in place the right investment climate. There is significant opportunity in Nigeria. And as we said in the prepared comments, we're encouraged by the exploration results that we've had. But we're just going to have to wait and see where it moves. There are a lot of issues that they're dealing with and we've got to be patient, but we've got make sure that we weigh in. But in short, I'd tell you that we're encouraged by the new government and where they're heading. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And this is a small but potentially contentious issue. Just I saw Asia gas volumes down, and I hear that Petronet in India is rejecting cargoes, or at least low on the take-or-pay commitments. Just maybe talk through, it's probably just a timing issue in terms of how that might affect volumes. But talk through about any issues with Asia gas that we should be aware of, just for modeling. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I guess what you're referring to is on Asia gas that we're down sequentially. That's primarily due to some entitlement impacts associated with some quarterly true-ups as well as some decline in other impacts. With respect to LNG contracts, they're confidential, as you can appreciate. As I said earlier, all of our contracts are based on a longer time horizon. We've got various elements within the contracts to give us and the buyer some flexibility, but there's really nothing more to share beyond that. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Jeff, I think when we met midyear you were saying there hadn't been a major upstream FID this year. At the same time, I'm seeing that you're consistently losing money in the U.S. C&P. The two, one is obviously long cycle; the other is short cycle. I was wondering in the short cycle case why you seem to be maintaining very high levels of activity when you've got nearly a $0.5 billion loss here and whether or not that's a function of perhaps oil profits being offset by natural gas losses, or if I'm missing something about the breakdown of that loss. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : So let me give you a perspective of the upstream U.S. business. Paul, all of our assets are managed to maximize returns through the lifecycle, which is obviously on a longer time horizon than the current price environment. As you've heard me say before, we really focus on those things that we control, like integrity, reliability, productivity, importantly our development and operating costs, making sure that we've got operational flexibility, and as you've heard the downstream side, the pursuit of higher-value product yields. I'd say that importantly, we invest in attractive opportunities through the cycle that will further enhance the profitability and capture savings in the soft market. And as I've said before, the current investment program that we have underway in the U.S. portfolio is attractive in this price environment. I'll also... Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Based on the assumption that oil prices are higher in the future? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : No, not at all. So I'll remind you... Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Based on the assumptions that efficiency gains will make it profitable in the future? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Based on factual current data that we've got and how we manage the portfolio as well as the existing operations. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : I guess what I'm looking at is maybe $0.5 billion dollar loss in U.S. C&P. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Right. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Will that become profitable in due course at these prices? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Again, we manage the business over a longer time horizon. And to be clear, our U.S. upstream portfolio continues to generate positive cash flow. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, so it's positive cash. So what's the problem with the earnings then? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Again, Paul, we manage the business over the longer time horizon. And we'll continue to do what we do very well and manage the things that we control, continue to work on the operating costs and the reliability. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes, I understand. I'm just slightly digging around just because it's been a fairly consistent loss. And because it's short cycle, I think that's what I'm really driving at. I would have thought that it's a short cycle business, therefore the short-term performance might be better. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : The increase in the loss in the third quarter was primarily driven by another reduction in crude realizations that we all experienced as well as some additional downtime and maintenance. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay, thanks, Jeff. I'll leave it there, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Thank you. We're getting pretty long on the call, so I'm just going to keep it to one and hopefully be fairly quick. Jeff, can you confirm that the Iraqi government has asked you to slow investment at the West Qurna project? And can you comment whether you're now at peak capacity in Phase 1 of the project and whether you'll be able to hold that level if you're not investing? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : On the first point, Jason, I really can't talk about discussions between us and the government. Production has remained above about 400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter with continued pressure support, and that has grown over the recent past. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: And do you expect that you'll be able to hold it at that level? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : It will be our intent to maintain production levels. Obviously, that's going to require continued investment and pressure maintenance. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Got it, thank you. Operator : Roger Read with Wells Fargo has our next question. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks, good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess maybe following one of the questions earlier from Ed, as you look at other countries where maybe they're becoming a little more reasonable, whether it's your tax structure, royalty structure, PSCs, et cetera, we've seen Canada raise taxes. We've had Nigeria stuck in neutral for a number of years. As you look across the rest of the globe, are there any places where we're seeing some adjustments from a political standpoint that might make things more attractive over the next couple of years? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I think if you look at the globe across the full value chain for the energy sector, I would point to the progress being made in a number of places. One place is Mexico. Mexico has made significant progress opening up the door to investment. You think about some opportunities in West Africa that have opened up, East Africa. Now of course, when you open up a new area, there are a lot of other issues we've got to deal with because there's limited infrastructure, perhaps not a well established fiscal basis, so it does take more time. But nonetheless, I would tell you from an encouraging foreign investment that there's been some pretty good progress out there that's increased the amount of opportunities that we've got before us. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And as a follow-up to that, you mentioned earlier in the M&A discussion that it had to compete with your internal opportunities. As you look at maybe a changing dynamic internationally and your exploration spending because I think of that as having to compete with the M&A side given the uncertainties and the longer timeframe, how is exploration spending keeping up with the overall spending reductions adjusted for efficiencies and all that? Is it going to remain a similar percentage of total CapEx? Does it need to decline in this environment? Just curious which direction you're going to go there. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Think about it as being more opportunity-driven. It's a function of the opportunities, the maturity of our resource assessments, and the appropriate timing to make the investment within our obligations to the resource owner. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No percentages? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Nothing to quantify, it's a very large and extensive resource base that we're pursuing. But I will again remind you that it's solely focused on how it can high-grade our existing portfolio. So after we've done the assessments and we have a better handle on what the prospect potential is, it's got to be able to compete before we'd be spending more money there. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right, appreciate it. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yeah, hi, two quick ones. How's Kearl going? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Well, thanks for asking, John. Kearl is moving along very nicely. As you heard, we got the Kearl expansion started up ahead of schedule. All the learnings have been fully integrated into the expansion project. It's ramping up quicker than initial development. And through the quarter, we produced in excess of 180,000 barrels a day gross. And I'll tell you that we have produced over the 220,000 barrels a day design. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay, great. Next one and last one for me is you're seeing a lot of your IOC brethren reduce their risk profiles. I think other people were getting at this. Are you at all worried in terms of your global portfolio or the world as a global portfolio of having fewer potential partners for these large-scale projects going forward, or is this an advantage because you execute well? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : I think a couple thoughts there. One is is that clearly we're in the risk management business. There's a lot of risks that we deal with, one of them being the geopolitical risks, another one being the economic risks associated with many multiyear investment programs on these big multibillion dollar investments. I wouldn't say that we're seeing a back-off on interest by our typical partners in these type of investments. I would say that there's clearly a desire for us to continue to be in a leadership role in a lot of these big investments. We think we've demonstrated our credibility, and I think that plays well not only with the resource owner but with the industry as a whole. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : All right, John. Operator : Our final question today comes from Guy Baber with Simmons. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for fitting me in here. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : You bet, Guy. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : I wanted to talk a little bit about North America unconventional. But you've highlighted efficiency gains this year have been significant and the benefits from technology improvement. You obviously have a broad perspective across various plays in the Bakken, Woodford, Permian, and your gas plays. So could you just talk a little bit about which specific play you see the greatest potential for continued efficiency gains and technology application? Really just trying to get some differentiated thoughts by play in the U.S. in terms of what the current view might be and maybe how that's evolved over the last year or so. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : It's a really good question, Guy, in particularly the way you ended your question because it has truly evolved over the last several years. Our prominent acreage holdings are in the Bakken, Permian, and the Woodford. I would tell you that we're very, very excited about all those opportunities. Clearly, the Bakken is more advanced in terms of its development, although I would also say that we continue to capture additional cost and productivity improvements in the Bakken. The Permian has got multiple reservoir objectives, and I think that presents a unique opportunity to further optimize the value, probably more so than the Bakken. And the Woodford is very early stages, and it's really hard to compare and contrast at this point. But in summary, rather than saying one is better than the other, I'd tell you that they're all very exciting. They're all a very important part of our portfolio and have significant value uplift potential for us in the future. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Okay. Great, Jeff, and then last one for me. The international downstream business performance was very impressive obviously, but you earned more this quarter than all of last year combined. Can you talk about the fundamental margin outlook going forward for refining, particularly internationally? We've been surprised by the strength of that market this year. And maybe the same for chemicals, just given those businesses have done such a tremendous job this year of offsetting the weakness in oil prices, so it's important. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Well, as you know, broadly speaking, refining margins are really a function of product demand and available refining capacity, not only new capacity adds but also rationalization of capacity in regions that have excess capacity. We do not provide a forward look on margins. But I would say that particularly in the non-U.S., you've seen really good strength in Europe, Asia very similar to the U.S., driven by Mogas. I think the results really underscore the strength of our integrated portfolio. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Thanks for the comments, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Operator : With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodbury for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Secretary & Vice President- Investor Relations : To conclude, I again thank you all for your time and your questions, a very interesting period right now. I think you can see from ExxonMobil's performance that we continue to meet both our operating and our investment commitments. We are very focused on the fundamentals. We have always been focused on the fundamentals, and we have seen that as being a very important element on the success of this corporation. So thanks for your questions this morning, and we do appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining.",

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two. Now turning to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. Exxon Mobil generated full year earnings of $16.2 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $2.8 billion. These results reflect proven strategies that we've consistently applied for decades along with a relentless focus on the business fundamentals, including project execution and effective cost management. While our Upstream financial results reflect the challenging business environment, stronger performance in our Downstream and Chemical segments highlights the resilience of our integrated businesses. Exxon Mobil completed six major Upstream projects during the year. These new developments in Canada, Indonesia, Norway, the United States and West Africa added 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity and contributed 3.2% volumes growth. Strong operating performance of the base portfolio along with these project efficients delivered full year production of 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, consistent with our plans. The corporation's 2015 cash flow from operations and asset sales were $32.7 billion, with positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion despite sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth continued to slow during the fourth quarter across nearly all major economies. In the US, estimates show growth softening further since the third quarter. In Asia, China continued to decelerate with significant volatility in the financial sector. And Japan experienced ongoing economic weakness, whereas Europe's economy remained stable with continued tempered growth. Crude oil prices extended declines on global oversupply conditions and natural gas prices moved lower, reflecting unseasonably warm weather through the quarter. Furthermore, global refining and chemical margins weakened due to lower seasonal fuels demand and decreased chemical realizations. Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $2.8 billion or $0.67 per share. Corporation distributed $3.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $500 million was used to purchase shares. CapEx was $7.4 billion, down more than $3 billion from our fourth quarter of 2014. As a result of ongoing capital efficiencies, market savings, reduced activity and timely project delivery. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.1 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $38.7 billion. The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. Total for the quarter cash decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The cash decrease from working capital changes includes both normal seasonality as well as the effect of the decline in crude prices on account balances and receivables and payables. Uses included net investments in the business of $6 billion and shareholder distributions of $3.6 billion. Cash flows were balanced over the quarter by increasing short-term borrowing by about $4 billion. Moving on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $3.8 billion from a year ago quarter, though our Upstream earnings were partially offset by stronger Downstream results, whereas decreased Chemical earnings were mostly offset by lower corporate and financing costs. In the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $1.5 billion due to lower earnings across all business segments. On average, corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next year to two years. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $857 million, down $4.6 billion from a year ago quarter. Sharply lower commodity prices reduced earnings by more than $3.7 billion. Crude realizations declined more than $30 per barrel and gas was down $2.76 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $100 million. Volume additions from new developments were partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands. All other items decreased earnings by $960 million, reflecting the absence of prior year impacts including US deferred income tax effects and the recognition of a favorable arbitration ruling for expropriated assets in Venezuela. These were partially offset by lower operating costs. Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production increased 194,000 barrels per day or 4.8% compared to a year ago quarter. Liquids production was up almost 300,000 barrels per day or nearly 14%, where ramp-up of new development projects, work programs and entitlement effects were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production decreased about 630 million cubic feet per day due to regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline, partially offset by entitlement effects and development project volumes. Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased about $500 million from the third quarter. Lower realizations reduced earnings $840 million where crude prices were about $8 per barrel lower than the third quarter, and natural gas prices were down $0.40 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings $250 million, reflecting new project and work program growth along with higher seasonal demand. All other items added $90 million driven by tax impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the fourth quarter was $2.26 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased 330,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 8.4%. Liquid production was up 150,000 barrels per day, reflecting new project growth, work programs and entitlement effects. Natural gas production was 1.1 billion cubic feet per day higher in the third quarter, driven by stronger seasonal demand in Europe, entitlement effects, and new project start-ups. Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $854 million compared to the year ago quarter. Stronger margins and favorable volumes mix improved earnings by $610 million and $70 million respectively. All other items increased earnings $170 million, primarily driven by reduced maintenance activities and favorable foreign exchange and tax effects partly offset by unfavorable inventory impacts. Turning to slide 14. Sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $682 million as lower margins reduced earnings by $860 million. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $60 million, reflecting lower US maintenance. Other items improved earnings by $120 million, primarily due to higher gains from asset sales partially offset by unfavorable inventory effects. Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $963 million, down $264 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $210 million, while favorable volumes and mix effects added $170 million due to lower maintenance. All other items decreased earnings by $230 million, largely due to unfavorable foreign exchange, inventory and tax effects. Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down $264 million sequentially. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $190 million while favorable volumes mix added $80 million. Other items decreased earnings $160 million, primarily reflecting increased maintenance activities. Turning now to the full year financial results starting on slide 17. Now as I mentioned, earnings were $16.2 billion or $3.85 per share. Corporation distributed over $15 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. And of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares. CapEx totaled about $31 billion for the year, a reduction of almost $7.5 billion or 19% versus 2014 and approximately $3 billion below our plans for 2015. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $32.7 billion. Turning to slide 18, cash decreased from $4.7 billion to $3.7 billion during the year. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program resulted in $32.7 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included net investments of $26.2 billion and shareholder distributions of $15 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $7.6 billion in the year. Moving to slide 19, graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion funded shareholder distributions and most of our net investments in the business supplemented by an increase in debt financing. The investments we select have attractive financial returns and justify the moderate use of our strong balance sheet capacity. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flows along with our financial strength provide us the flexibility and confidence to invest through the commodity price cycle to meet long-term energy demand. Corporation has continued to pay a reliable and growing dividend, directly sharing the corporation's success with our shareholders. Total dividends per share, $2.88, are up 6.7% versus 2014. As you know, we prudently tapered the share buyback program during 2015, consistent with changes in the business environment and the corporation's cash requirements. In the first quarter of 2016, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs and we do not plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. During 2015, Exxon Mobil generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, reflecting our cost and capital discipline and the resilience of our integrated business model. Looking forward, we anticipate capital and exploration expenditures to be $23.2 billion in 2016, a decrease of almost $8 billion or 25% from 2015. So to summarize this slide, the corporation finished the year with positive free cash flow. We have significantly lowered our capital spending plans and are aggressively pursuing operating efficiencies and cost savings as we continue to ramp up production from our major projects, all of which will support cash flow moving forward. We will provide further details on investment plans at our upcoming analyst meeting. Moving now to slide 20 and a review of our full year segmented results, 2015 earnings decreased $16.4 billion as weaker Upstream results were partially offset by stronger Downstream performance and lower corporate costs. Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $7.1 billion were $20.4 billion lower than 2014. Realizations reduced earnings by $18.8 billion as crude oil prices declined more than $45 per barrel and natural gas dropped about $2.50 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume mix effects increased earnings $810 million where contributions from major project startups over the last couple of years as well as our work program activities were partially offset by the impact of regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline. All other items decreased earnings by $2.4 billion. Lower gains on asset sales and absence of prior year deferred income tax effects were partly offset by lower operating expenses. Upstream unit profitability for the year was $4.89 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. This reflects significantly lower commodity prices partially offset by asset high-grading, including the startup of new development projects. Moving to slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, up 3.2% compared to last year. Liquids production was up 234,000 barrels per day or 11%, benefiting from major projects in several countries, work programs and entitlement impacts, which were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production however was down 630 million cubic feet per day as regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and field decline were partly offset by additional major project volumes in Papua New Guinea and the US along with higher entitlements. Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on slide 23. Earnings were $6.6 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from 2014. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $4.1 billion. Volume and mix effects mainly driven by increased maintenance reduced earnings by $200 million. All other items decreased earnings by $420 million, while reflecting higher maintenance activities and unfavorable inventory impacts, partly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. On slide 24, we show the full year comparison for Chemical results. 2015 earnings were $4.4 billion, up $103 million from 2014. Stronger margins increased earnings $590 million, while favorable volumes mix added $220 million due to lower maintenance. Other items reduced earnings $710 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, tax and inventory effects, partly offset by asset management gains. Moving next to an update on our Upstream project activities. We continue to deliver on our investment plans, which are adding higher value production capacity to meet long-term demand growth. Fixed major project startups in 2015 added nearly 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest capacity. We also progressed development of our high quality acreage in the Permian and Bakken at a measured pace, where drilling programs added 85,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of gross production in 2015. In the fourth quarter, the Banyu Urip central processing facility successfully started up. Current gross production is 150,000 barrels per day and continues to ramp up towards full capacity as we optimize both well and facility performance. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on 10 major projects that will come online over the next two years. We expect to start up six of those in 2016, which will add more than 250,000 barrels per day of working interest production capacity. Moving now to slide 26. We continued to execute a paced and focused exploration program to deliver accretive value to Exxon Mobil's asset portfolio, while capturing cost efficiencies in today's softer market. In offshore Guyana, the largest 3D seismic survey in the company's history is nearly complete and we will begin appraising the Liza discovery during the first quarter. We also acquired a 35% interest in operatorship of the Canje block, which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block, adding over 520,000 net acres. In the Romanian Black Sea, Exxon Mobil has completed exploration activities in the Neptun block after successfully drilling seven consecutive wells since July 2014. Based on the results of the program, including a successful well test of the Domino prospect, we are advancing detailed development planning and economic viability studies. And in Argentina, we are beginning a production pilot program on the La Invernada and Bajo del Choique blocks in the Neuqu\u00e9n province. Program consists of five wells along with construction of production facilities and a gas pipeline. Over the past few months, we have also added high potential acreage to our diverse portfolio. Exxon Mobil acquired a 35% interest in Block 14 offshore Uruguay, capturing almost 580,000 net acres. In Canada, we were awarded interests in three blocks offshore Newfoundland and Labrador, adding over 650,000 net acres. These blocks are in a proven oil-prone hydrocarbon basin with recent industry discoveries. And this new opportunity will build on our 18 years of success in Eastern Canada with Hibernia, Terra Nova and the ongoing development at Hebron. And in Western Canada, we acquired additional working interest in our currently producing Duvernay acreage, adding 10,000 net acres. So I'd now like to conclude today's comments with a summary of our 2015 performance which demonstrates the resilience of our integrated business. Exxon Mobil earned $16.2 billion, underpinned by the benefits of our integrated business model which captures value through the cycle, as demonstrated by our strong Downstream and Chemical results. Corporation achieved its full year plan to produce 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Volume contributions from a portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Our results also reflect a relentless focus to reduce costs. In 2015, we achieved about $11.5 billion in capital and cash operating cost reductions. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $32.7 billion and positive free cash flow of $6.5 billion. Our commitment to shareholders remain strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. So regardless of industry conditions, we remain focused on what we can control and are driven to create shareholder value through the cycle. And we will discuss our forward plans in more detail at our upcoming analyst meeting which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 2, with the live webcast beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern Time. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning everybody. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jeff, the CapEx cut is pretty material. I wonder if you could help us reconcile Exxon's view of spending through the cycle with the extent of the cut and maybe give us some idea as to maybe just to clarify two things. Where, is really a function of the slowdown in E&P spending? I mean it was already underway, and does it still include the minority affiliate contribution? And I've got a follow-up please. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, yeah. Doug, first let me start with your second question first. The CapEx guidance that we've provided for 2016 of $23.2 billion is all in. It includes consolidated and equity companies and it compares directly with the $31.1 billion that we spent in 2015. To answer your first question, I'd first like to say that as I said in my prepared comments, we were down in the year in 2015 both from 2014 performance as well as our planned guidance in 2015. And that was primarily a continued focus on capital efficiencies, market savings and a soft business climate. There was reduced activity and then importantly timely project delivery. If you think about 2016, it's more of the same. It reflects prudent cash management and our continued investment through the cycle in attractive high-quality opportunities that we believe will generate long-term shareholder value. The short of it is that we're going to continue to live within our means. We're going maintain financial flexibility. And we've got, as you've heard us talk in the past, we've got very diverse high-quality inventory investment opportunities that will continue to progress. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks Jeff. So yeah, I assume that was one question with a couple of parts to it. So my follow-up is, I realize you've been fairly tight-lipped on Guyana to date. Obviously this is a big acreage that you've had. And there's my understanding is Fugro has already started the subsea survey, which suggests that there's and early production system scheme underway. Can you just give us a general update as to where things stand in Guyana, whether there is indeed an early production system target on how you see the overall scale of the opportunity to the extent you can chat about that at this point? Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah thanks, Doug. I clearly understand the industry interest in the discovery. As we said at the time of discovery, we're very encouraged with the initial results, recognizing that we only have one well in a very, very large block, over 6.5 million acres. We have since the discovery moved quickly to get a drill ship contracted and onsite to appraise the discovery and we expect that to spud very shortly. As I said, the seismic acquisition is nearing completion. The results from both the well as well as the seismic are being actively assessed to assess the full block potential as well as the commercial viability of the Liza discovery. Obviously the objective of the first well is an appraisal well in Liza and it's intended to give us important information to size the resource as well as get a test on it to assess the key variables associated with the commercial viability. So I would tell you that there are early studies underway on potential development options for the field, but I don't have anything more to share on that. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: In the press release you called out some of the project startups and what seemed like a net overall favorable mix effect on income. I think that maybe Western Canada is included in the startups but not maybe a contributor to mix income enhancements. Can you talk about Western Canada, kind of the heavy levels of pressure we're seeing on heavy oil out there? And maybe frame an outlook for us. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, sure. I mean no doubt profitability is compressed in this price environment. As I had said before, we remain very focused on the fundamentals. And I'd tell you that the team there in Canada have done just an exceptional job in driving the cost structure down and enhancing reliability. We are not by any means where we want to be. In fact I would tell you that we're never satisfied with the status quo. We will continue to work that, recognizing that we feel very good about the resource potential, not only in Kearl, but in Western Canada in our portfolio. We think that over the long term, the asset's going be a high value. The focus is around maintaining cash profit and maximizing long-term value in the asset. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. And it's sort of on the other end of the same spectrum I guess is LNG, which is considered by many investors to be cost prohibitive but actually has a pretty low overhead once it's operating. Can you help us understand how that contributed this quarter and through the year, specifically with PNG and some of the positive income contributions there. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Sure. I mean, Sam, it's a great question. Because LNG clearly is a key component of our portfolio and it is an important part of our margin generation. Remember, we're constructive on long-term demand. For gas, as you just saw the recent update on our energy outlook, we got gas growing about 1.6% per year. LNG is anticipated to triple between now and 2040. So we're very well poised to participate in that demand growth over the long term. I will tell you that for, let's use PNG as a really good example. The initial design basis of PNG was about 6.9 million tons per annum. As we said in the third quarter, the organization did a exceptional job in doing what we do very well, and that is getting more out of the asset. And we were able to get it up to in excess of 7.4 million tons per annum, which has been just a phenomenal result. And we're still going. So it's a good example of how we really continue to manage the existing assets to reduce the cost structure and improve operational reliability to maximize long-term asset value. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thank you so much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You bet, Sam. Operator : We'll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Jeff, good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Phil. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question is just kind of a bigger picture macro question. Obviously pricing has been tough across all end markets, oil, natural gas, LNG. And I'm just curious if you see a fundamental supply/demand improvement happening in any one particular market versus another over the next year or two. So for example, do you see oil recovering faster than natural gas or anything else along those lines? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, so I guess I'd say that we're price takers. And we manage the business to create margin through self help. We have built this business to ensure that it's durable in a low price environment. And then any upside from that is additional return on the investment. So the organization is very focused on really managing the fundamentals. As I indicated, we're for both gas and oil. We're constructive on long-term demand growth and is the fundamental basis for the investment decisions that we've put in place. And if you look near-term, demand's been growing about 1 million barrels per day per year. And although supply has been growing at a higher rate, we certainly have, I mean the first half of this year, we're about 1.5 million barrels a day in excess of demand. We expect that to converge in the second half as seasonal demand increases. We got to come in balance, like we have seen historically. We do have a bit of a buildup in crude storage that will have to be worked off before you see real growth in prices. But ultimately, we're going to manage wherever we are in the price cycle to create margin by focusing on the fundamentals. Same story around LNG. As I said previously, that we're very constructive on where LNG demand is going to go over from now to 2040. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Understood. The second question is just on the capital spending guidance. Thanks for giving us the preview ahead of the Analyst Day. I guess what I was wondering was, year over year how much of that you might attribute to project roll-off or deflationary benefits versus a reduction in activity. And just in general, you came in under the 2015 budget as you said. How much flexibility is there do you think relative to the guidance number versus that being kind of the lowest you could go? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, Phil, I don't have specific numbers to quote with you. I mean, and as I said we'll talk more about our investment plans and our thoughts on volumes next month in the analyst meeting. But a couple things to share with you. Clearly, our peak was back in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. The drop from 2013 to 2014 was primarily a result of a drop-off on this very significant major project load that we decided to take on. Obviously in every year, we are working on capital efficiency opportunities to build into our spend pattern. As we go forward, I would tell you right now most of the drop is associated with the prudent cash management that we've got. It's not indicative of the quality of the portfolio. As I've said previously, our portfolio is very deep and diverse across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business. Some of the activity that we've slowed down really provides us an opportunity to rethink near-term investments and really fully capture the market benefits going forward. But short of that, I really don't have any more specifics to share as to breaking the CapEx spend down further. We'll continue to live within our means as we've shown historically, and if we need be, we'll have to tighten up if we have to further. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So you see some additional flexibility even relative to this guidance? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: We've got flexibility both ways. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good day. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Exxon's unique, relatively unique in its ability and dedication to counter-cyclically spend. Can you discuss the decision to cut the buyback in that context, and is that reduction any reflection on relative attractiveness of the portfolio, value of the stock or a weaker macro outlook? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: No, I mean we've got a very, as I said a very deep and diverse portfolio. Much of that investment could be moved forward in today's environment, but as I indicated, we have a real opportunity to go ahead and rethink some of those expenditure patterns and capture more value from those investments. So the decision to cut the buyback doesn't at all reflect the quality of the inventory. Quite the contrary. I mean the inventory is very robust. The decision on the buyback, as we've said before, our capital allocation approach is really focused on the dual priority of funding attractive investments and continuing to provide a reliable and growing dividend, and the share buybacks have always been the flexible part of our capital allocation program. As we continue to progress in a very challenging business climate, you saw us prudently taper back the buyback program. We will continue to evaluate the buyback program on a quarterly basis depending on changes in the business as well as the investment climate, and advise on a quarterly basis when we think it's, when it's appropriate. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Maybe if I can shift gears into the US. You're currently running I think seven rigs in the Bakken and eight rigs in the Permian. I mean maybe particularly in the Bakken, what's the driver of continued activity at current prices? I mean are those economic wells, or are you preserving efficiencies for an ultimate reacceleration? And maybe the same question for the Permian, yet that might be kind of HBP driven. Any color would be helpful. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, Evan, it's a good question because we have a very extensive well inventory in our unconventional business, particularly in the liquids plays, the Permian, Bakken and the Woodford Ardmore. Once again, it's a conscious decision to be measured in our investment program. When we saw the big ramp-up in rigs back in 2014, 2015, we were very measured in how we ramped up because we wanted to ensure that we fully developed the learning curve and captured those real cost benefits that translate into higher value as we fully developed these fields. So the investments that we're making right now are economic. They're attractive in this business climate. We are maintaining a certain baseload of activity where we can continue to leverage some of the best service providers that we've got. We're one of the few that can continue to invest in a down cycle. We've high-graded all the services that we get in our unconventional business. In fact, I'd extend that globally. And we are continuing on those learning curves, and I think it just better positions us to maximize the value from these assets. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : So on slides 25 and 26 you talked about the project portfolio and the growth trajectory longer term. Simultaneously though, when you consider that the growth is coming at the expense of returns during the past cycle, not just for Exxon, but for the other supermajors too, it makes me wonder whether there should be more emphasis towards value creation, especially when considering that the valuation for some of the big oil companies is pretty much at its lowest level of the past two decades and in some cases three decades. My question is whether or not the issues of structure and returns and growth are being revisited internally, maybe more so than in the past. Or is that what is implied in the new spending outlook that you talked about today? And then also whether or not returns on capital, which I didn't see mentioned in the presentation, is still as relevant as it used to be. So two questions. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yes. Doug, on the first one, I mean your point about value creation in our investment program, we couldn't agree with you more. And I would tell you that it is never \u2013 our view has never changed on the importance of making the right value choices. We saw back in the, I'd say in the early 2000s to the mid 2010 timeframe, we saw a number of major Upstream projects that got to the point of maturity that we could make a investment decision and capture unique value by progressing such a large load of major Upstream investments. There were cost synergies that we were going to capture that ultimately was going improve the long-term return of those assets. So we knew that by taking on such a large load, it was going to impact our return on capital employed because we would build up a very large load of non-productive capital employed. But we also knew that when those projects came onstream, that they were going be accretive to our overall average financial performance. So unfortunately as these projects are coming on, the price environment has changed for us. But nonetheless we still feel very good about the long-term financial performance of these assets. Because remember, when we make the final investment decision, we're testing those investments across a wide range of economic parameters, including price. And as I said earlier, our fundamental focus has been making sure that our business is viable and durable in a low price environment. So ultimately we believe that these 30 plus major Upstream projects that had an impact, rightfully so, had an impact on our return on capital employed are going be accretive to our financial performance over the long term and we believe they were the right decision. Now to your second question on return on capital employed, it is still very much relevant to us. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: We believe it is a fundamental measure that differentiates us, and that's why we continue to talk about it. We have never lost sight of the importance of that metric relative to the investment decisions that we're making. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. Maybe there will be a returns and valuation and catch-up in a more normalized environment in the future then. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: That's correct. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks a lot. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Operator : We'll go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, good morning. Congrats on obviously $11.5 billion of capital and OpEx savings. OpEx, you haven't really spoken about as much this morning. Just maybe run through some of the actions you took to reduce OpEx over the course of last year and then the potential to cut OpEx further. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, thanks for that, Ed, because it is a very important story of our 2015 performance. First, let me just make sure everybody understands the number that we've been talking about. The numbers are fully consistent with our external reporting so that you all have good line of sight. Of the $11.5 billion I mentioned, about $8.5 billion of that is operating expenses, and it includes a number of things positive and negative. For instance, it includes the structural efficiencies that we were able to capture. It includes the market savings that we've been able to capture. Remember, I've talked in the past about having a unique organization or global procurement organization that is really focused on achieving the lowest life cycle cost. The number includes benefits in energy costs, includes benefits from our asset management program as well as ForEx. There are increases in that number. Obviously we've been talking about all these new projects coming onstream. With them comes an increase in operating costs. And we'll continue to manage those assets like we do with our mature inventory. There was also a higher Downstream load on unplanned maintenance that added cost during the year. So simply put, the $8.5 billion is a year on year comparison. The rest, $3 billion, is in CapEx and includes a lot of the same actions I just talked about as well as decisions to slow down some activity to capture opportunities in this business climate. I will note that that $3 billion only reflects the reduction from our planned guidance. As I said in the prepared comments, our year on year reduction in CapEx was $7.5 billion. So we didn't really include the $4.5 billion in the $11.5 billion that I talked about in the prepared comments. So in total, year on year our total reduction is really $16 billion if you include the $4.5 billion. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, and then in terms of the ability to drive further OpEx, I mean another 10%, another 15%, I mean how low do you think you can get that OpEx saving? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: It's a great question, Ed. It really is, because it really talks to the strength of the organization. In this low price environment, it presents opportunities too. And the organization is never satisfied with the status quo. The organization is very focused on leading that cost curve. And while we may have some internal stewardship objectives, rest assured that we continue to look for new unique ways to capture structural improvements which are most important, because remember, those are the ones that will be permanent going forward. So there's a lot more to work on. But I don't have any specific numbers at this point. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I look forward to the Analyst Day. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Okay. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Maybe if I could follow-up on the comment that you've made a couple of times now. You've talked about how you guys are rethinking near term investments and the way you deploy capital. I mean how much does this refer to an evolution of your views on relative attractiveness amongst various components of the portfolio in terms of, does this represent at all a shift in attractiveness of onshore versus deepwater versus oil sands or LNG, et cetera? Or how much is just referring to rethinking the cost structure in the near term environment in an effort to continue to push down prices? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: It's really both. It's every investment dollar is competing. So it's all about how do we get the most value out of those investment dollars that are being deployed throughout the business. The organization, as I indicated, really views the down cycle as a real opportunity to go back and retest development concepts, retest the cost structures, retest the commercial terms. And whether it's short cycle or long cycle, we're going to maintain that competitive focus and make the right value choices coupled with our prudent cash management. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up on that, I mean during the most recent downturn in 2008, 2009, you took advantage of the environment by pushing through more counter-cyclical investment in places like the Canadian oil sands. And I think we all realize that this downturn is different, but do you see similar opportunities to leverage your strength in this environment, either on the cost and project development side or maybe even on the research acquisition side? Or is your outlook different enough at this point that you feel that more prudence is necessary in the short to medium term? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Well I mean clearly, given the uncertainty in prices, we're going to maintain prudency. But at the same time, as I've said a couple times, Ryan, we really do see that this is an opportunity to capture further value in the bottom of the cycle, and across all the areas I've already mentioned. But there are plenty of opportunities that the organization's focused on to really make that value proposition. And I'd also add that because of our ability to invest through this cycle, our service providers understand that if they can provide lower-cost, higher-value solutions to us, then we'll continue to invest if it makes good business sense. So having not only the organization focused on it, but also our service providers focused on it has provided some unique opportunities for us. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Jeff, I'm looking forward to seeing you all at the analyst meeting. I know that Mr. Tillerson's been in New York a couple of times \u2013 I should say in New York and in Miami making some statements. I haven't personally spoken to him since last March. The general message that you had then was certainly that we would be lower for longer. I assume he's still making that argument. I think that he was saying that you guys would be typically keen to make acquisitions at the bottom of the cycle, but the bid/ask spreads were too wide. He was saying less interest in buying a balance sheet that was bad. He would prefer to buy a balance sheet that was good, and I think you've said that consolidation in the Permian would be an area of interest. Is that the latest message that we've got, for example, at the Miami conference? I'm sorry, I wasn't present. I was wondering if the message has changed. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, well I mean from a supply/demand perspective, I shared some of our thoughts around expectations. Clearly the oversupply currently and the overhang from storage is going to have a dampening effect on prices in the near term. But Paul, as we've talked in the past, we continue to be focused on the fundamentals and through our self-help creating margin, and that's what's most important for this business. We invest to ensure that the business is durable at low prices. We continue to manage the business based on our focus on the fundamentals to create margin. From a acquisition perspective, clearly I'm sure there's a tremendous amount of interest. We remain very patient. We keep alert to the value propositions. But it's as I've said before, anything that we see out there has got be competitive with our current investment inventory. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Sure. I mean the bid/ask spread element, is that, must \u2013 I mean by just looking at the share price charts, that has to be narrowing now between what you guys would see as value and what sellers would. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah. Well I mean clearly, bid/asks could be a function of a number of factors including the business climate, unique capabilities and assessments of individual investors. And certainly, the longer the commodity prices are in this area code, the more pressure it will put on the bid/ask. But I think also, Paul, as you're probably well aware, I mean the absence of any major deals absent a few couple one-offs really talks that there's still a gap to valuations. We'll be thoughtful. We'll make sure that anything that looks of interest is going to be value adding. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Indeed. And then a bit of a technical question. Does Mr. Tillerson retire on his 65th birthday, or at the beginning of 2017 typically? I mean, what would be the model? I guess what I'm driving at is, is this going to be his last analyst meeting? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, well I mean I'm not going to provide any specifics. That's really at the function of the board's decision. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: All right. Thank you, Paul. Operator : And we'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess I'd like to follow-up a little more on your Lower 48. You talked earlier about the rig count and trying to maintain spending within a reasonable level of returns, but balancing that against the maintaining the right amount of service sector capability and all. But as you look at Lower 48 volume growth, which was certainly reasonable in the past year, does it grow in 2016 at these levels? And I know you wouldn't necessarily start with the idea of growth, but does it grow at these levels? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah. Well I don't have any specifics to share with you right now. But I would tell you, think about this, is that the choices that we are making are all based on value propositions. The outcome of those will be volumes. And as I indicated earlier, Roger, we've got a very deep portfolio of investment opportunities in the Lower 48, particularly in the unconventional business. And we'll maintain an appropriate balance of short-cycle investments. And when we feel like that the business climate supports it, we'll probably increase the amount of activity. I think what's important to note is that we are very well poised to flex the program up or down depending on the business climate. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Appreciate that. The other question I had was on the share repo program, understand taking it off the table for now. If you were to get a surprise influx of cash flow, just say higher commodity prices, is the decision in the near term that it would likely go towards shareholder returns or that CapEx would go up? I know Exxon is not a quick trigger place like some other businesses, but you do have opportunities as you've said in the Lower 48. What's sort of the internal thinking on that front? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Well, I mean if it was an influx of cash flow, I would tell you that it's going to be a function of the board's decision on a quarterly basis. I mean, if we see supply and demand continuing to balance out, that may be a signal for us to modify our investment plans going forward. But as I've indicated previously, Roger, the board makes the decision on a quarterly basis on what level of buybacks we want to maintain, and consider a whole range of factors including the business climate in making that decision. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. So Powerball lottery by itself doesn't do it. You have to have some other fundamental things helping you out. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah really. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you, Roger. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Neil. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So Jeff, you've had a great year here of production. This is something where I'm sure we'll get more clarity in March. But can you just talk about at $23 billion, how you think about the level of production relative to the 4.2 million barrels a day that you outlined last year for 2016, and then which, broadly speaking, which regions where you would see potential changes? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah well, Neil, let me first just take an opportunity to acknowledge a very strong operational year in 2015. Achieving the 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day which I'll just want to emphasize for the group. It's really an outcome of our value choices that we've made. The organization has really delivered on the timely startup of our major projects, which are a very key and significant contribution to our volumes this year. I'll say looking forward, as I alluded to in the prepared comments, we have 10 more large-scale long-life projects starting up over the next couple of years. The first, the next tranche of that will be six of the 10 starting up in 2016. We maintained a very strong focus on the high-value work program as well as operational reliability. Looking forward, we will be sharing more on our near term investment plans and some thoughts on our volumes in the upcoming analyst meeting. But I really don't have any more specifics to share with you at this point. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate that, Jeff. And then obviously one of Exxon's key advantages here is your balance sheet. In light of some of the comments from the ratings agencies, can you just talk about your commitment to your AAA rating here? And then any perspective that you can provide around how that could change as ratings agencies think about their market outlook. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah it's a good question, Neil, and clearly it's topical for many in the energy sector. I mean first and foremost, let me just be clear. We get value from the AAA credit rating in our business, whether it be access to financial markets or access to resources. I mean there is a benefit that we get from it, and we see it as being important. But it is really an outcome of our longstanding effective management of the business, including things like our strong balance sheet, the way we have prudently managed our cash, our disciplined investment and our leading financial and operating results, all of which has allowed us the financial flexibility to invest through the cycle as we've been discussing. I'd tell you that the current environment is clearly tough. But we've managed the business to be durable on the low end of commodity prices. We're very well positioned to continue the same level with superior performance in the future and we think that all underpins the strong credit rating that we have. Neil Singhvi Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Jeff, good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two really quick questions. The $23.2 billion, how much is related to the (1:03:59) and also that within that number, how much is for the major project spending? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You're talking about our 2016? Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, sir. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: CapEx guidance. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: We'll provide, Paul, we'll provide you more information on our spending plans in the analyst meeting. I really don't have anything more to share at this point. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see, okay. The second one then real quick. It looked like you have $800 million on the asset sales proceed. What is the asset sales gain in the quarter? And that also do you have, it seems like that you may have some tax adjustment benefit in the quarter, and that you have also mentioned I think some FX impact and also inventory impact. Can you quantify those items in the quarter and if possible, by segment also? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yes, so Paul, on the proceeds from asset sales which was about $800 million in the fourth quarter, the equivalent earnings impact is about $350 million, primarily in the Downstream. Could you talk a little bit more about the second question, just make sure I? Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, it looked like that the effective tax rate is 13% in the quarter. We understand the mix of the earning, oftentimes the impact, the absolute level of the tax, but it does look like it's low enough that you may have some tax benefit or adjustment, year-end adjustment on that. Just curious if that's the case. And if it is, can you quantify it? What is the tax adjustment benefit and also that which segment is being impact? And also that I think in your prepared remark, you have comment that some impact on the earnings on the FX and also inventory. So just want to see if you can quantify those. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Sure, sure, okay. Let me walk through them for you. On ForEx, the quarter on quarter impact is essentially nil. I mean it's a slight negative to earnings, less than $5 million. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: How about sequentially? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: I'm sorry, say that again. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sequentially you're talking about right, this one closest to? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: That was quarter on quarter. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2014. The full year had a negative impact on our earnings of about $125 million. That's ForEx, okay. On tax, so yes, our effective tax rate was 13% in the fourth quarter, and that was down about 19% quarter on quarter. A fair bit of that had to do with one-time tax items. The rest, about 5%, was due to portfolio mix of income across the business segments and the geographies. And that's really spread across our corporate and finance as well as some of the segments. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jeff, when you say that one-time tax item, 14%, seems like you're talking about 14% because you say 19% overall reduction, 5% is due to the mix of the asset, and so the one-time item is 14%. Is that 14% spread across different segment or it is primarily in Upstream? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: It's in corporate and finance and several of the other segments. I don't have a breakdown for you. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And how about inventory impact? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, before I leave tax, I just want to be clear for everybody that assuming our current commodity prices and our existing portfolio mix, we still would anticipate that the effective tax rate is between 35% to 40%. If you look at the full year of tax in 2015, it was just under 34% and that included obviously some one-time tax effects. Okay? On inventory, Paul, quarter on quarter, it had a negative earnings impact of about $375 million. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Okay. You're welcome, Paul. Operator : And we'll go next to Anish Kapadia with TPH. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Anish. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Hi. Good morning. Just had a question looking at production and declines. If we look at 2015, it seems like underlying production was flat. So we saw new projects that were offset by production declines. I wanted to try and understand in terms of 2016 how much of your CapEx is going into the base business and to mitigate declines. And so what do you see the underlying decline rate to be with the current spend? Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Anish, we have an underlying decline, as we included in our 10-K, of about 3%. On top of that, we add major project activity. Again, I don't break it out by use, and we'll talk more about investment plans in the analyst meeting next month. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Okay. And just to clarify on that, so given the CapEx cuts that we've seen, you wouldn't expect that decline rate to accelerate on the back of the CapEx cuts? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: No. Remember, it's a base decline rate ex-major project activity. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Okay. The second question was on plans for space for new major projects. Given that cutback in the CapEx, do you have any potential FIDs for this year that you're looking to sanction? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, on FIDs, we just don't forecast FIDs in advance of the investment decision made by the corporation. When we make that decision, when the investments get to a level of maturity and we make that decision, then we communicate. I'll remind you that we have 10 major projects that will start up in the next two years, as I indicated before, and they will certainly... Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Can I just? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: And they will certainly contribute to our base performance. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : I just wanted to clarify, I think I might have missed it from earlier. I mean there was a question on the impact of production from the cutback in your rigs. What would you expect your exit to exit US onshore production to be this year? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Well as I indicated, we'll share more about our investment plans as well as our thoughts on volumes in next month's analyst meeting. We've got a very deep, robust inventory of development projects in the Upstream, and we'll talk more about that next month, or I guess, yeah, next month. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Sure. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Oh yes, hi. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Morning, Jason. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: I was hoping you might be able to just give us a little bit of the detail on those project startups that you're expecting in 2016 and 2017, just to make sure my list is correct. And if you want to share the contribution that the 2016 startups are making towards that 250 kpd capacity, that would be helpful as well. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, on the startups in 2016, of course we've got Gorgon, Jansz. We have late in the year Kashagan. We've got Julia in the Gulf of Mexico, Heidelberg in the Gulf of Mexico, Point Thomson in Alaska and Barzan in Qatar. And Jason, we provide the peak level of capacity in our F&O. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Great. So that probably hasn't changed too much since that was published then. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: No, and we'll provide an update to that list next month as well. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Got it. And if I could just ask one more, Jeff, on the Downstream. You've put in place a couple of projects in Europe to potentially take advantage of heavier feedstocks over time, let's see, Antwerp being the primary one. I was hoping you'd talk about what you're seeing just in terms of those heavier feedstocks within Europe and how the profitability's evolving on that. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, thanks for the question on the Downstream, because the organization has really performed tremendously in the year. Our investments in the Downstream, particularly in Europe, are really focused on the following items, one, to increase feedstock flexibility, The second is to increase logistics flexibility. The third one is to increase higher value product yields. And I'll come back to that. And then the last and important one is fully capturing the integration value of our manufacturing facilities and reducing our cost structure. On the higher value product yields, when we talk about Antwerp or Rotterdam, both are achieving the same objective. On Antwerp, we're converting bunker fuel oil into ultra-low sulfur diesel, again constructive on longer-term supply/demand. And in Rotterdam we're converting VGO into premium Group II basestocks and as well ultra-low sulfur diesel. Jason D. Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: That's great. Appreciate that, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Great. You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go next to Asit Sen with CLSA. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Hi, Asit. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Two questions. One very quick one on Banyu Urip. Nice ramp-up there. When do you get to peak and any update on the size of recoverable resource? I think that's 450 million barrels and cost I thought you guys mentioned, $3 billion. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, so the size of the resource, let me just confirm your number. It's about 450 million barrels gross. The ramp-up, we should be up at full rates somewhere in the first half of this year. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay and the cost, I think $3 billion? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You know, Asit, I don't think we've shared the cost publicly. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Okay. All right. And then moving on to LNG. Thanks for your color on the long-term LNG market. Just wondering if you could share any read into emerging near-term trend, LNG particularly response in China to a lower pricing environment? Given your comment on China deceleration, I thought that was a overall comment. And also on LNG, any update on Golden Pass? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, I guess two points. On the near-term expectation of LNG, there's a number of projects, some of which are already coming online that are probably going to take us above demand for a period of time, say into 2020 to 2023 when the supply and demand will start coming to converge again. So clearly, I mean it's going have a pressure on those volumes that are trading on the spot market. Just to remind everybody, when we make a investment decision on these projects, we lock in our investment decisions on long-term contracts. Golden Pass, we have submitted our formal application with FERC to construct and operate the project. We're working closely with the federal and state agencies for completing the review process in 2016. The final investment decision will be made once we've gone through the government and regulatory approvals. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You're welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Allen Good with Morningstar. Allen Good - Morningstar Research : Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Allen. Allen Good - Morningstar Research : I wonder if given all the changes that we've seen in the oil markets over the last call it 18 months, has Exxon revised the range of prices that it uses to evaluate investment decisions? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Well I'd say, Allen, that we continue to see that the range is applicable, given our constructive review on supply and demand. We won't speculate on specific prices or differentials. We certainly expect the weakness until supply and demand comes back into balance and the storage overhang is worked off. As I've said a few times, Allen, regardless of what the price is doing, we're going to keep on focused on those things that we control, which really translates into self-help margin. Allen Good - Morningstar Research : Thanks, that helps. And then deepwater offshore, a very big part of Exxon's portfolio, getting bigger from what you've shared today. Can you give any indication as to what Exxon's seeing with respect to either cost savings via equipment or services or maybe even cost savings on the redesign of certain projects that will ultimately lower the breakevens and make them more competitive within your portfolio? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, really good question. There's a lot of different variables in this, one in terms of the quality of the resources and the certainty on overall potential from those resources. Another one being how do we get the structural capital efficiency built in so that the economics are more robust. I'll highlight a couple things. One, in 2015, you'll recall in West Africa we brought on two very capital-efficient subsea tiebacks to the existing infrastructure, one being the Kizomba Satellites Phase 2, another one being Erha North Phase 2, that allows us to leverage existing knowledge and develop the deepwater resource in a much more cost-effective way. Clearly, there's a lot of opportunity to continue to standardize the subsea kit, but the organization is looking at all the levers to improve the economics of deepwater. In the Gulf of Mexico, I should note that Hadrian South was another example of an efficient, capital-efficient subsea tieback into existing infrastructure. Allen Good - Morningstar Research : Great. Thank you very much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go next to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Most of my questions have been answered, so I'll keep it short. I was just curious back on CapEx, I would assume that Downstream is relatively flat sequentially and that the vast majority of the cut is coming from the Upstream side. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, we'll provide more insight on that, Brad. But as you saw in 2015, our Downstream and Chemical spending plan increased with a number of very large projects that we saw significant value chain benefit, with the polyethylene trains in Baytown to the European investments that we've already talked about. And of course, those projects are continuing as you go into 2016 and start up into 2017. So the trend is going to continue going forward. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yeah hi, Jeff. A couple quick ones from me since so many things have been asked. For the Liza offset well, will we be talking about this in the second quarter conference or in the first quarter conference call? Or will it TD by then? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: So, John, I don't really have the specifics. When we believe there's something that would be important to share externally, we'll go ahead and share it. I just don't know whether the first quarter will be the appropriate time or not at this point. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. That's fine. Many of your peers, Jeff, are restructuring. They're rightsizing or downsizing. Exxon hasn't had any news like that. So are there any plans in the work or do you feel that you have an adequately sized workforce given your business model? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, it's a good question, John, and I appreciate you asking it. Let me first say for the group's benefit that one of our greatest strengths are our people. And I think those of us that went through the layoffs in the 1980s really learned some of the hard lessons about how those layoffs significantly impaired organizational effectiveness. I mean since then, we have been very diligent at managing employee head count given the cyclical nature of the business and the need by the organization to be ever more productive and at the same time grow collective competency to meet the challenges in front of us. In doing so, I'd also say that we've been unrelenting on our focus of capturing efficiencies to make sure that we rightsize the organization, again given the likelihood of business volatility. I'd also highlight, John, that another benefit of our integrated business model is that we're able to be agile in redeploying personnel to segments of our business that are experiencing market strength or growth, such as our Downstream and Chemical businesses right now. All that said, our employee head count has been coming down consistently since the Exxon and Mobil merger. We're down about 35% through 2015. Over that time period, if you look at just the last five years, we're down about 20%. And I can rest assured that the organization's going to continue to be focused on productivity enhancements and making sure that we're getting all the efficiencies out of the business. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Sure. But you haven't had anything that's knee jerk or reactionary as some of your peers of late? It's just been part of your normal plan, correct? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: That's correct. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : All right, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you, John. Operator : We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. You talk about entering acreage in some new geographies, particularly some frontier type of geographies. Since the oil down cycle began, have you noticed fiscal terms becoming more accommodating in any areas? And if you can provide any examples that would be great. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Pavel. I would tell you that certainly given the downturn, there are more opportunities for us to consider. There is nothing that I can share with you specifically, but it does speak to the strength of Exxon Mobil given that we've got the capability to invest through the down cycle. We bring a tremendous amount of operational, commercial and project expertise. So it allows us to be very selective as to what choices we want to pursue with a very strong focus on placing our attention on those areas that are close to existing producing infrastructure, those areas that have very high quality large resource potential. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Appreciate it. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you, Pavel. Operator : And we'll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for answering all the questions. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Good morning, Guy. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : I know this is a tough question to answer, but I'm interested in how you think about this strategically. But given the scale of the CapEx reductions we're seeing, how do you think about the sustainability of these lower organic spending levels with respect to being sufficient to drive a modest level of production growth for the portfolio, yet also replenish the resource base? Are you spending now below what you believe is sustainable? And how do you think about the balance between spending at a sustainable level versus perhaps rationing lower to limit your out spend for a period of time? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah, I would tell you, Guy, to really think about the decisions that we're making are really value driven. The output is really the volumes, but it's really making the choices that are aligned with creating value in the portfolio, whether it be in the Upstream or the Downstream or Chemical business, recognizing that we've got this integration, this very strong integration across our portfolio that we can create value through the whole value chain. So the choices are really focused on making sure that we're creating incremental value. The volumes will be an output of that. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Got it. That's helpful, Jeff. And then last one for me, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, but given your global perspective, your participation in various Downstream markets across the globe, can you give us the view on leading-edge global oil demand growth for 2016? Any color would be great as it's obviously a critical piece of the global supply/demand balance. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah. Well, I mean you're talking about oil demand? Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Yes. Yes. Specifically oil demand. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Yeah. Well I talked a little bit earlier about underlying demand growth has been over 1 million barrels per day, so it's been a little bit higher than what we've seen over the 10-year average. You think about where we are today, we're about 1.5 million barrels a day oversupply in the first half. We do expect that to converge in the second half with seasonal demand growth. So you think about the impact on prices in the near term, it's really going be a function of how that supply/demand converges, and of course working off the storage overhang that's been built up over the last couple years. That's about all I can share at this point. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Got it. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Jeff Woodbury for any closing remarks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations & Secretary: Well, thank you. To conclude, again I'd like to thank you for your time and questions. I just want to step back for a moment and take stock of 2015 and say the organization really did a very significant, provided a very significant result when you think about it : positive free cash flow; very effective cost management, lowering our spending that had bottom line impacts, benefits to the business; our excellence in project execution and our delivering long-life, long-plateau volumes; the benefits of the integrated business model across the value chain; the financial strength of the organization, investing through the commodity price cycle; and then of course our dividend growth, continuing to share the success of the company. And I think that just points to the strong business fundamentals based on our proven track record. We'll talk more about this in March, but we do appreciate your interest in Exxon Mobil and we certainly look forward to meeting with you next month. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations & Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Now turning to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines for first quarter performance. Exxon Mobil earned $1.8 billion in a difficult business environment marked by low commodity prices. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $5 billion in the quarter. These results demonstrate the durability of our integrated business enhanced by our relentless focus on managing those factors that we can control, including effect of cost management, reliable performance and operational integrity. The highlight this quarter is our strong chemical results which underscored significant gas and liquids cracking advantages at our integrated sites and differentiated capabilities across the value chain. Corporation also continues to make steady progress on its investment plans. During the quarter we benefited from recent capacity additions while reducing CapEx 33% versus the prior year quarter. We continue to effectively manage our spending while selectively investing in the business to meet long-term energy demand and importantly grow shareholder value. Moving now to Slide 4, we will provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained weak during the first quarter. In the U.S. estimates indicate growth has slowed further since late 2015. In China growth continued to decelerate however economies in Japan and Europe showed some modest improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Crude oil prices were quite volatile and decreased relative to last year while natural gas prices continued to fall. Global refining margins weakened on lower distilled demand and continued surplus inventory. However chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened on lower feed and energy costs. Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated, Exxon Mobil\u2019s first quarter earnings were $1.8 billion or $0.43 per share. Corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was just over $5 billion down 2.6 billion from the first quarter of 2015 reflecting continued steady progress on our investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $4.8 billion and debt was 43.1 billion. Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of 4.5 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $3.7 billion which included the impact of anti dilutive share purchases. Exxon Mobil will continue to limit your purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plan and programs but does not currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Earlier this week the Board of Directors declared a second quarter of cash dividend of $0.75 per share a 2.7% increase from last quarter marking our 34th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings decreased $3.1 billion from a year ago quarter, lower Upstream and Downstream earnings were partially offset by stronger chemical results, and lower corporate costs. The corporate effective tax rate was 19% during the quarter down from 33% a year ago reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and onetime favorable tax effects reported in the corporate and financing segment. On average corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be $500 million to $700 million per quarter over the next few years. In a sequential quarter comparison shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $970 million as stronger chemical results, partly offset lower upstream and downstream earnings. Tuning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 9, upstream earnings decreased $2.9 billion from a year ago quarter, resulting in a segment loss of $76 million. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.6 billion. Crude prices declined by almost $18 per barrel and gas fell more than $2.25 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable sales mix effects reduced earnings $100 million, all other items decreased earnings another $250 million where lower gains on asset sales and less favorable tax effects were partly offset by reduced operating expenses. Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production increased 77,000 barrels per day or 1.8%, to more than 4.3 million barrels per day compared to the first quarter of last year. Our liquids production was up 260,000 barrels per day or 11.5% driven by capacity additions from recent project startups and continued good facility reliability across the portfolio. However, natural gas production decreased 1.1 billion cubic feet per day or 9.3%. Growth from major projects was more than offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands, field decline, divestment impacts and lower entitlement volumes. Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on Slide 11, upstream earnings were $933 million lower than the fourth quarter. Realizations decreased earnings by $1.2 billion where crude declined more than $8 per barrel and gas fell almost $0.75 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and sales mix effects improved earnings by $170 million including contributions from new projects and higher natural gas demand. All other items added $140 million reflecting lower operating expenses partly offset by lower favorable tax effects. Moving to Slide 12, sequentially volumes were also up 77,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.8%. Liquids production increased almost 60,000 barrels per day, up 2.3% from ramp up of new project volumes. Natural gas production was up 120 million cubic feet per day reflecting stronger seasonal demand in Europe, partly offset by regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and lower entitlements. Moving now to the downstream results starting on Slide 13, downstream earnings for the quarter were $906 million a decrease 760 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by 860 million, partly offset by 100 million of all other items, primarily favorable foreign exchange effects. Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, downstream earnings decreased $445 million as weaker margins reduced earnings by 470 million, unfavorable volume and mix effects mainly from increased European maintenance activities, decreased earnings by another $150 million. All other items provided a partial offset adding $170 million mostly from lower expenses. Moving now to chemical results starting on Slide 15, first quarter earnings were $1.4 billion up 370 million versus the prior year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from liquids cracking in Europe and Asia increased earnings by $250 million. Higher global sales volumes contributed $80 million while all other items added another $40 million again from lower expenses. Moving to Slide 16, sequentially chemical earnings increased $390 million due to stronger commodity and specialty margins. Unfavorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by lower expenses. Turning now to Slide 17, as you may be aware Standard & Poor\u2019s reduced its credit rating on Exxon Mobil by one notch to AA positive with a stable outlook. Earlier this month Moody's reaffirmed its AAA credit rating on the Corporation with a negative outlook. We want to be clear that nothing has changed with respect to the Corporation\u2019s conservative financial philosophy or prudent management of its balance sheet. Our ability to access financial markets on attractive terms remains strong. Exxon Mobil's financial strength remains a significant competitive advantage and enables us to create long-term shareholder value despite near-term market volatility. Exxon Mobil's has a long history of prudently managing our capital structure and financial capacity through numerous commodity cycles and fully expect to manage through this one under those same prudent financial principles. Moving now to Slide 18 in an update on upstream projects in the exploration program, four major projects startups year-to-date added 170,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In January the Heidelberg project in the Gulf of Mexico, started up several months ahead of schedule and under budget. Heidelberg is a five well subsea development in 5,300 feet of water tied back to a central trust bar production facility with the peak capacity of 80,000 barrels of liquids and 80 million cubic feet of gas per day. In Australia Train 1 or the Gorgon LNG project started out in March as you know LNG production has been suspended due to mechanical issues which the operators are actively working to resolve. In April Exxon Mobil started up two more projects ahead of schedule and under budget, Julia in the Gulf of Mexico and a Point Thomson initial production system on Alaska's North Slope. Julia is a capital efficient subsea tie back to an existing production facility another example of Exxon Mobil's capability to cost effectively develop new deepwater resources by leveraging existing infrastructure. Production will continue to ramp up in the coming months as two additional wells are completed. At the Point Thomson project two injection wells will work in tandem with the production well cycling up to 200 million cubic feet of gas per day to an onsite central processing facility to extract about 10,000 barrels per day of condensate. Notably the project provides a foundation for future gas development on the North Slope and further demonstrates Exxon Mobil's ability to safely and responsibly execute complex projects in challenging and remote environments. Two additional major projects are expected to come online later this year namely Kashagan and Barzan closing out to six major projects start ups planned for 2016. Turning now to our exploration program where we continue to pursue and evaluate high value resource opportunities. Offshore Guyana, we completed the largest proprietary 3D seismic survey in our company's history and we are currently drilling the Liza-2 appraisal well. Data from the appraisal well and the 3D seismic will be used to evaluate the block\u2019s potential and development concepts. We do plan to drill additional exploration wells with existing rig. Offshore Uruguay, we are participating in the Raya-1 exploration well in Block 14, where we have a 35% interest. And in the Gulf of Mexico we were the apparent high bidder on five new exploration blocks and lease sale 241. Final award of these blocks expected later this year and we will further strengthen our 1.1 million net acre position offshore. Branded utilized proprietary seismic imaging technology and continue to build the portfolio of attractive future drilling opportunities. So in conclusion Exxon Mobil remains focused on creating value through the cycle. We are advancing self help initiatives, driving down costs, increasing efficiency, proving reliability and capturing incremental across the integrated portfolio. First quarter Corporation earned 1.8 billion in a difficult business climate benefitting from structural advantageous in our downstream and chemical operations. Integrated business generated $5 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. We continue to successfully progress our investment plans, increasing upstream production volumes for 4.3 million oil equivalent barrels per day, while reducing CapEx and upholding our reputation as a reliable operator. Exxon Mobil paid $3.1 billion in dividends during the quarter sharing the Corporation's success directly with our shareholders and we remain steadfast in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is comes from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : In the downstream volume for both gasoline and diesel seemed to be weaker than the industry markers during the quarter and also over the past year, so my question is twofold, one how much of the weakness can be attributed to items such as divestitures unscheduled downtime whether et cetera, meaning what is the real apples-to-apples comparison for the company and then two, with these results, I wanted to see if you had a little bit more color or maybe more specific read through into the key economies around the world, and you touched on at the outset, but just want to see if you had a little bit more specifics in that area? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I think on the first item, I'd tell you just stepping back a little bit on the downstream, our fuel margins were weaker with distillate being at five year lows due to as you are much aware global surplus capacity and high commercial inventories and obviously that was aggravated by warm winter in the low heating oil demand and particularly in the U.S. less demand in the energy sector, although gasoline margins remain strong and demand is growing above capacity growth. We saw as I said in my prepared comments that from a volume perspective, we had increased maintenance activity predominantly in Europe, in the first quarter of this year if you compare it sequentially first quarter to fourth quarter, we had a much higher load on planned maintenance, I'll say broadly speaking Doug in 2016 our overall planned maintenance would be lower than 2015, but we will have a fairly heavy first half. Doug Terreson : And then maybe a read through a little bit more specific read through into the global economy, I mean there numbers were weak I think you highlighted that but do you have anything else to add to your comments earlier? Jeff Woodbury : No I mean, I think I would step back more so from a macro on supply and demand and if you look at the last decade, overall demand has increased about 1 million barrels a day, maybe a little less in that and if you look at demand growth here in last two years plus this year, 2014, 2015 and into 2016 as to what we expect, we're seeing demand growth in excess of the 10 year demand growth. So, I think it's a good indication of pretty healthy demand increase, very consistent with our outlook for energy with oil growth growing about 0.6% per year and gas growing about 1.7% or 1.6% per year. Doug Terreson : Okay and then second Jeff, the return on capital and valuation have declined versus the previous cycle for most energy companies and I think you have prompted one of your competitors to indicate that returns, even at the expense of growth would probably be their new path forward and so I'll resonate pretty clear that returns are still important for Exxon Mobil. But my question is whether there has been any specific movement towards maybe changing the future balance between spending and shareholder distribution or do you guys think that as pre-productive capital normalizes that the situation will resolve by itself. So how do you guys think about that? Jeff Woodbury : Yes well from a macro perspective, as you know, we're constructive on oil and gas demand. We have maintained a very disciplined capital allocation approach for the longer term horizon that hasn't changed, we went through these down cycles before, we've built this business to be very durable in a low price environment and we've maintained a financial flexibility throughout in order to continue to take advantage of opportunities whether they're on the top of the cycle or at the bottom, the return on capital employed continues to be a very strong focus for us, you've heard us talk in the past about a strategic decision years back to go ahead and invest in a number of major upstream projects concurrently in order to capture very a unique value that probably no one else could capture, like Exxon Mobil. And that had a burden on the return on capital employed for a period of time but rest assured, all those investments are being tested across our average financial performance to ensure that we are adding accretive value and we still view the return on capital employed, there is a key metric in the end as to how effective our value choices are. Operator : And our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Okay. My first question is on unconventionals, you are running close to 96 rigs at the peak of the life cycle down to 16 today, 4 in the Bakken and the Permian given the environment. I know you have presented a significant potential growth for Exxon, but I just want to understand how you -- and somewhat related to Terreson\u2019s question, how you think about increasing activity in a recovery I mean you have a lot of options, a rigorous process, is there an oil price, is it access cash flow target or even a fundamental outlook in supply demand that will drive your swing in this shorter cycle resource in a recovery that is? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well let me ask you to think about it this way. And then it really for Exxon Mobil it really starts at the micro level with our view of supply and demand as I explained to Doug a moment ago we have been very constructive of long term energy demand. For our long cycle investments it's really a function project maturity that actually maximizes value best, keeping in mind our prudent financial management to ensure that we are meeting our commitments and maintaining financial flexibility. Now for the shorter cycle investments that you are really asking about, by and large it is the same but with a much narrower focus on the near term business climate. So it's not really a price trigger for us, it's really a combination of all the relevant factors to ensure that we are maintaining our very prudent financial management but same ensure that we have financial flexibility to continue to investment when opportunities come along. And as you know, I mean we are spending $23 billion this year, which represents a lot of investment activity. Evan Calio : I know there is a great consistency to your approach through the cycles and through time. Do you see the allocation changing any way favoring a shorter cycle resource versus more conventional allocation given some of the changes that could be evident through the cycle, for few forward cycles and I will leave at that? Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I think Evan. It's a good question and probably worthy of a more deeper discussion sometime but I\u2019ll tell that the mix of shorter cycle and longer cycle has changed overtime, obviously as our inventory base grew in the lower 48 unconventional. But our fundamentals are how we manage the business hasn\u2019t changed at all and the choices that we are making are really driven by how do we maximize shareholder value? All these investments compete and as we have said previously, we are not opportunity constrained we have got a very, very deep inventory across the portfolio not only in the upstream but also in our downstream, and chemical business. And just making sure that when we progress a project and investment decision that we have identified the optimized value proposition for it and it's competing for that capital across the portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we ever set targets around segmenting the total investment program between long cycle and short cycle, it is just the factors I talked about a moment ago, making sure that we are -- the investments have matured that we believe we have maximized value and that we maintain prudent financial management to sure that we can meet all of our commitments and retain our financial flexibility. But we have got a very deep and diverse inventory of investment opportunities. Operator : And our next question will come from Brad Heffern from Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : I was wondering if you could put a finer point on the chemical's performance during the quarter. It seemed like it's a little bit stronger than maybe the micro environment would have suggested, I think you cited cost savings or operating cost savings in your prepared remarks, but is there any more detail you can provide around it? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, while there has been really good -- I mean you step back again here for a moment to also very constructive on chemical demand growth, grown about 1.5% of booked GDP and that really sets up the investment proposition going forward. If you look across the segment commodities have been growing pretty strong very tight particularly in Europe and Asia. Demand growth has been growing much quicker, and really sets up a really good investment proposition into the future. The margin benefit is primarily feed and energy dropping quicker than product realizations. I\u2019ll also say though that our gas crackers continue to be advantaged even though the liquid crackers margin improved the gas crackers here in North America continue to have a very advantaged feedstock slate that allows us to compete very strongly in the demand market globally. Brad Heffern : And then looking at CapEx, I think the number for the quarter is pretty well below in terms of a run rate basis, the 2016 CapEx guidance, I am curious if you are expecting seasonality in that number or if there is a reason to expect that that\u2019s going to increase meaningfully going forward, or if you are actually truly below the CapEx on a run rate basis? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Brad. So, just to set the stage as you all remember our CapEx for 2016 is down 25% set at about $23 billion the organization has not taken their foot off to paddle they continue to work towards identifying capital efficiency opportunities we\u2019re still capturing market savings and importantly and I want to emphasize that we're delivering our major projects on schedule and on budget in many cases ahead of schedule and below budget all of that is translating into capital savings that you are seeing in the first quarter of this year. We are not going to change our capital guidance at this point but I'll tell you that we are we\u2019re making good progress. I'll just say for a moment that the organization has really responded to the low price environment in a very effective way, they keep very-focused throughout the cycle but particularly in the bottom of the cycle and have really risen to the occasion and continue to identify substantial opportunities for the Corporation to save both cash and OpEx. Operator : And our next question will come from Doug Leggate from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : I also have a couple of questions if I may my first one is really about some more specific on the oil sands business, it's been a fairly large part of you\u2019re -- the project growth and the shift towards liquids and so on, but obviously in this environment I have to imagine it is a substantial drag on your cash margins so I'm just wondering if you could to the extent you can just give us some idea what the economics of Carol in your oil sands business generate Cold Lake and so on it looks like in this environment and what I'm really thinking about is the kind of free cash torque that could generate in a recovery scenario and I've got a follow up please? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well I mean generally speaking the oil sands certainly no doubt profitability is compressed in this price environment but the organization once again keeps very-focused on the fundamental particularly our cost and reliability and they are making really good progress refining structural enhancements that create margin at the bottom line. If you think about the resource base that we've got in oil sands we've been working in the oil sands now for over three decades including technology development and on the mining side I think Carol is a great example where we applied proprietary technology that was able to reduce our capital investment our operating cost and improve our environmental footprint that will increase long-term value. The same is true for the in-situ operations I mean we've been optimizing our cyclic stream operations at Cold Lake for a long time and we are identifying additional technology benefits like solvent assisted steam assisted gravity drainage technology that will improve once again the recovery and lower our cost and improve our environmental footprint. I think it's a testament to how Exxon Mobil manages its portfolio, we work the project, management and execution very, very well and then when it starts up they just keep on working on that cost structure and create margin because we know we can't count on price, what we got to count on is the things that we control that being cost and reliability and our integrity of the operations, but the last point I\u2019d make is remember we also get value across the full value chain because our upstream is fully integrated with our downstream and chemical business. Doug Leggate : Jeff. My follow up, I'm going to have a stab at this one and it might be a very short answer but on Guyana can I frame my question like this my understanding is that the appraisal well is something of a two stage effort stage one being treat before the drill sand test and I'm just curious to the extent you can share with us whether that well has achieved this objectives and the additional plans perhaps to bring a second rig in and any comments around the additional prospects that have been identified. I realize it's early but just looking for any update you can share on whether that well achieved its objective? Jeff Woodbury : Sure, Doug. And I understand the interest that you and others have about Guyana. I mean we were certainly very encouraged by the discovery well the organization moved quickly to get a dealership contracted and get it onsite to appraise the Liza discovery the well spud in February we do plan to drill multiple wells this year. Liza-2 is progressing according to expectations, we will plan to test the well and we should complete that activity mid-year as I said in my prepared comments we did complete the 3D seismic survey on the Stabroek Block and we began a survey on the Canje block, which we picked up to the east of the Stabroek Block. The well and seismic data is being assessed real time in order to provide insights into the discovery and the ultimate block potential. We do plan on moving the rig from the Liza appraisal well over to a new prospect to the Northwest after it is done at Liza. Operator : And our next question comes from Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin : There is actually quite a bit of enthusiasm developing for NGLs in the U.S. right now among the investor community, I was wondering, if you could offer sort of a -- how that might impact, an outlook on how that might impact Exxon going forward in the context of your sort of overall gas outlook, and you could even get more esoteric if you want regarding heat content and all the benefits that you might see in your unconventional gas business, would given the fact that, U.S. earnings, U.S. upstream earnings have been dragging a little bit here for the past few quarters? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well it's a good question because it really highlights once again the benefits of the integrated business that we've got from the very large resource inventory and unconventionals in the U.S. all the way through to our chemical business, what's important is that we have built the chemical business to have a very wide flexible range of feedstock capability including ethane, propane, butane, all the way to gasoil. So, we've got significant flexibility within the chemical business to modify the feedstock in order to maximize margins, I'd say the same is true for Europe and Asia, particularly in Asia Pacific, in our Singapore refinery, cracker that we have an unprecedented range of feedstocks including the ability to crack crude oil which is an industry first. Sam Margolin : And then secondly on M&A, I think Mr. Tillerson was pretty clear at the Analyst Day that the organization is not interested in kind of taking on encumbered assets but Exxon Mobil has pretty good currency here, and I was wondering just in the context of whatever S&P's reasoning was in the revision if there is an opportunity to maybe equitize through M&A or asset additions or if that's even a factor, considering Moody's still has the stable rating? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Sam, I'd tell you that nothing has really changed on how we manage our portfolio and asset management includes the potential for accretive assets through acquisitions. As we talked previously and as you heard from Rex that we keep very alert to where there are, potential value propositions a high grade or existing portfolio, we're only going to pursue those acquisitions that we think have strategic value and are going to be accretive to our long-term returns and it's got to compete with the existing inventory investment opportunities that we have got, we've got to be patient. We want to make sure that we keep a very wide aperture on what the opportunities look like, I think we've got a good handle on where there are opportunities but we need to make sure that it is value accretive to the business and once we are able to lock in on a opportunity like that you will hear about it. Operator : And our next question is comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : First question on the quarter, you mentioned some color on the tax rate, it sounds like you separated it into two pieces one was mix and the other was some one time effects in the corporate and financing segment, and it sounds like the corporate and financing piece you expect to kind of revert to the 500 million to 700 million a quarter, I was just curious maybe on the mix side, kind of what drove that and if you think about the full year tax rate, would you expect that to still be similar to last year at current oil price levels? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, on the mix side, I'd tell you, it always has to do with the relative contribution between U.S. international between upstream, downstream and our chemical businesses and you can just sense from my comments that there was a lot of complexity in that. In terms of what they expect going forward, what I'd say is if we're talking about 2015 commodity prices, our guidance would stay at an effective tax rate of between 35% to 40%, now if we're in a lower commodity price environment like we saw in the first quarter, we're probably looking at something less than 30%. Phil Gresh : Second question is just may be a follow up on the balance sheet, looking at it slightly differently your absolute debt levels are now around $43 billion and just kind of wondering how you feel about that comfort-wise, as you look through the cycle, and in a better environment with more cash flow, is that pay down on an absolute basis in any way a priority or would you be thinking about other uses of cash? Jeff Woodbury : Well, I mean we'll -- obviously one of the considerations when we think about our capital allocation is retirement of debt, so we'll keep mindful but remember we've got a very strong balance sheet, we'll look at the relative decisions around investments in the business, the pace of investments, our commitment to our reliable and growing dividend and then appropriately consideration on long term debt levels. It's all about maintaining prudent cash management, maintaining our financial flexibility, we will continue to be disciplined in our investment approach, we are not going to forego attractive opportunities. But we will continue to assess our cash and our funding options around a range of options and take a very balanced approach on how we go forward in our capital deployment. Phil Gresh : If I were to just clarify, would that pay down be a priority over buybacks? Jeff Woodbury : That\u2019s a decision that would be taken by the Board that will be a function of a lot of factors Phil I wouldn\u2019t leave you with any impression that there is any prioritization that I am conveying. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul Cheng : Jeff I have two questions the first one may be a little bit more detailed and earlier just let me know. If we're looking at the economics, have you talked to your downstream people that whether right now economic to bring Naphtha into the U.S. gasoline pool or that you're better off to ship Naphtha into your cracker for the petrochemical in Europe or Asia? Jeff Woodbury : Paul, you are asking what about bringing Naphtha? Paul Cheng : From U.S. Jeff Woodbury : Importing it into the U.S.? Paul Cheng : No, no, exporting from -- either because I mean in order to show or in order we still have Naphtha in this country so the question that I have is that have you discussed it with your refining and chemical colleagues whether it's more economic for them to take the new Naphtha and bring it into the -- into the gasoline pool in the U.S. or that export it into the overseas such as in European or in your Asia petrochemical guy to use it at the pit stop there? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, we maintain tremendous flexibility on our feedstock options and that\u2019s a real time optimization that we are managing and we will optimize those feeds based on the best available returns. That\u2019s including moving feeds between continents. Paul Cheng : Yes, but just curious that I mean do you have any prior insight that you can share at this point that, how is the economics that have shift, is it more in favor of branding it into the gasoline pool in this country or that is exporting? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Paul I really don\u2019t have anything else to share on it other than to say that it's a dynamic issue that we continue to optimize, and I would say that we are very well positioned to ensure that we are making the best value towards it with respect to our feedstock swing. Paul Cheng : The second question is that, for the Point Thompson you had mentioned in your prepared remark that it is also gives you a platform or a demonstration for potentially in the future Alaska LNG project. Let's assume that if the Alaska LNG project won't go ahead and would be not economic at all, is the Point Thompson is still a good investment in here by itself with all that purpose? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I would tell Paul that we look at these decisions on a long term and given the constructive view what we think gas is going to do the overtime, we are confident that the Alaska gas will be commercialized as to how that actually happens, may vary from what we are currently considering. But we have been very active with our partners in the state to identify the highest value opportunity in order to commercialize that gas, and it's going to compete on a global perspective. What's going to be really critical is getting transparent predictable and stable fiscal structure in place in order to make sure that it underpins such a significant investment. Operator : And our next question comes from Blake Hernandez from Howard Weil. Blake Hernandez : I was hoping you could share a little bit about the rationale of the dividend increase, I know during your Analyst Day you kind a provided a cash flow breakeven, potentially in 2017, it sounded like then your remarks today you hit it kind of a alluded to some capital efficiency and maybe potential for capital to be moving down. So I didn\u2019t know if it would be fair to think that that cash breakeven number has potentially moved down and maybe if that played into your thoughts around the dividend increase? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I think your are referring to the cash flow neutrality slide that we shared with you during the Analyst presentation and if you recall, it's just a -- it's a perspective of how we are managing our cash and how we manage the business. And the organization is always trying to reduce that cost structure and improve the ultimate margins. And you are correct, I mean we had a -- we feel fairly confident that we can achieve cash flow neutrality into the future I mean what we shared with you during the Analyst Meeting was a very wide range on prices but one that\u2019s reasonable with the low end being $40 flat real and you can see that we have good potential to reach that cash flow neutrality particularly in 2017 and forward. As I said earlier, we continue to reduce our cash expenditures and making good gains but I would tell you that when we make the decisions around capital allocation it's a consideration of a lot of factors we are going to balance our long-term investment with our shareholder distributions nothing has changed but I will tell you that we remain very committed to that reliable and growing dividend. Blake Hernandez : Okay, great. The second one is just kind of project specific I know you mentioned Kashagan coming online later this year. I think there have been some press reports suggesting that could get pushed out to \u201917. Can you remind me I believe Exxon was ready to takeover operatorship, are you formally controlling the new flow on that or you relying on peers at this point? Jeff Woodbury : No. The Kashagan is managed by the North Caspian operating company. And which you may recall hearing is that, that was restructured in a more conventional manner and Exxon Mobil secunded the Director for NCOC. In terms of timing what we're doing there is we're replacing the onshore or offshore gas nova pipelines where NCOC is and they are making good progress they are progressing as per plan with intention they have to complete that by the end of this year and start up the facility. Operator : And our next question comes from Asit Sen from CLSA Americas. Asit Sen : So two upstream questions one on Upper Zakum and one on West Africa, on Upper Zakum in Abu Dhabi, Jeff there were talks to expand capacity to over 1 million barrels a day, could you update us on the current thought process on expansion and where production is currently? And secondly on in West Africa Exxon had decent success last year in starting up the new projects Kizomba in Angola and Erha in Nigeria, how would you characterize the current operating environment in some of the key countries given all the reported fiscal stress I know it's probably a generic comment but any color would be helpful? Jeff Woodbury : Okay, Asit. On Upper Zakum current production is around 650,000 barrels a day. It's the project itself is progressing well to increase capacity ultimately to 750,000 a day we are continuing to evaluate the opportunity expand to a 1 million a day development so really nothing more to share on that and what is that? Asit Sen : And Jeff on the timeframe for 750 is what timeframe? Jeff Woodbury : Getting up to that full 750? Asit Sen : Yes. Jeff Woodbury : I don\u2019t recall by probably around by 2018. Asit Sen : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : On West Africa let\u2019s just say we've made some really good progress but just a broad comment about globally there with country budgets feeling the strain of lower energy prices it is slowing down investment globally and that is a challenge to make sure that we progress those investments at a pace that is consistent with the resource owner. I'll say that we have a very strong inventory of opportunities in West Africa but we've got to do with consistent with confidence in the fiscal basis in which we are making those investments. Operator : And our next question comes from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess if we could talk maybe a little bit about cost deflation kind of where are you progressing both on the CapEx and the OpEx side and whether kind of consistent with one of the questions asked earlier if there was any seasonal component to that, that we should be thinking about? Jeff Woodbury : So just a recap for the results that we had last year we were able to reduce our total CapEx and cash OpEx by about $16 billion year-on-year representing about a 16% decrease. In terms of going forward into 2016 nothing has really changed we continue to manage the cost side as we always have focusing on structural efficiencies market savings while maintaining operational integrity. I will tell you Roger we still believe there is significant opportunity in streamlining the business and reducing the cost structure and I would say it's while it's early in the year we\u2019re seeing a similar trend line as to last year but we will maintain that relentless focus on cost regardless of whether we are in a low price environment or in a high price environment just to give you a bit of a perspective again being very early in the year our upstream unit costs for OpEx are down about 9%. Roger Read : And along those same lines at this point oil prices are rebounded, the market is starting to think about an ultimate recovery in drilling activity, do you take advantage, consistent with your view on there is lot more cost to get out, is this a point at which you'd want to sign contracts, kind of lock in service capacity, service pricing, kind of anywhere around the world really? Jeff Woodbury : I'd say Roger that, in the downturn we've been high grading our service providers and we've been locking in more favorable, more efficient service contracts, so it's not something that we had stopped doing, I mean, one of the advantages of Exxon Mobil is that we're able to invest through the cycle, that means that in a down cycle, we're continuing to spend a significant amount of money to capture value opportunities associated with that down cycle. So, of course the organization and you have heard me talk previously Roger about the global procurement business but it\u2019s all focused around finding the lowest life cycle cost and you are correct to say that in a low price environment, there are some unique opportunities that we want to walk in to. Operator : And our next question comes from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : So, clearly $48 Brent is not a great price but a heck of a lot better than $30 a barrel Brent and so, it feels like this market is moving in the right direction, demand is growing and we're seeing signs on OPEC supplies coming offline. I just want to reconcile that with your view, or does Exxon believe that we're starting to see the signs of a sustained recovery in energy prices particularly in crude and then because you get to see the world through your portfolio, one of the big debates is a non OPEC supply outside the U.S. really rolling over because of the decline rates, are you seeing evidence that that supply outside the U.S. is actually falling off? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, the first thing I'd say, Neil, and it's really a good guard around how the macro is looking and how the sector will respond to it, I'd say first and foremost is that remember, we are price takers, we are not counting on price growth, what we are focused on is really maintaining a focus on the things that we control in order to create margin, so regardless of what it is going to do, it is going to do it, and we'll go to keep focused on the things that we control. Second thing I would say in just a little bit more expansion of what I was sharing with Doug earlier is that underlying demand growth has been generally strong and we expect this year would be in excess of the 10 year average and I would say that in the first half of 2016, we're still oversupplied by about 1.5 million barrels per day. We do expect to see conversions in the second half with seasonal demand growth but that's going to widen again in the first half of 2017 and remember during this period of oversupply, we've been building up commercial inventories, since about year in 2013, so taking forward, we're seeing conversions over supply and demand into the future but we have got this overhead of supply that's going to also have to work off overtime. So, we're heading in the right direction in terms of how and when that will happen will be anybody's guess, remember there is still a bit of uncertainty in terms of the supply trend and the economic growth near-term but clearly we're seeing as you are all aware we're seeing North America supply dropping off pretty significantly now. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that Jeff and then I have two questions, related questions here, first is, any update on Torrance and then second what's the latest on Groningen? Jeff Woodbury : So on Torrance, we have completed the repairs of the electrostatic precipitator and that we have received the approval from the regulator to go ahead and start operations. So, there is a number of things that we need to do, to get it up and capacity demonstrated, but we do expect the formal change of control to happen mid 2016. Neil Mehta : And Groningen? Jeff Woodbury : On Groningen, as you know, we continue to have a pretty significant impact on volumes in the quarter, it was close to 600 million cubic feet a day, we have made our NAM has made the submission for the new production forecast going forward and my understanding is, is that the regulator will review that by September of this year, right now the cap is 27 billion cubic meters but it has the potential to grow up, depending on what demand requirements are. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : I was looking back at the interview that Rex Tillerson gave after the Analyst Meeting when he was asked about the AAA rating, and what he said quite specifically is that there has been periods where Exxon's financial metrics have been worse than they are today but you still retained a triple A rating, and obviously as you mentioned in your remarks, you have been downgraded by S&P. Naturally I went to S&P and what I saw there was the comment that maintaining production and replacing reserves will require higher spending from Exxon. So it seems that given the financial metrics are not the issues that it seems there's an upstream issue that S&P is concerned about. Can you talk about your ability to maintain production and reserves at the current level of spending and address whether or not they're correct in thinking that you are going to have to spend a lot more to maintain reserves in production? Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Sure Paul. Well, first, I\u2019ll remind everybody that we got a very large inventory of investment opportunities over 90 billion barrels of resourcing our portfolio and if you recall in the analyst presentation, we provide a little bit more inside as to the type of projects and their potential capacity they can bring on over the time horizon. And of course what we need to do is we need to make sure that as we mature that inventory of projects that we are doing it with the greatest value proposition and I think we have made a great strive in finding opportunities in order to reduce the cost structure going forward. I would say though Paul that we went to these cycles for a long time, we have been able to maintain a very strong balance sheet, we have maintained our financial flexibility to the ups and downs. And our inventory looks very attractive going forward. So we think all the elements are set right to continue to invest into an attractive way to maintain our initiative leading return on capital employed. The other point I\u2019ll remind is that as we showed in the analyst presentation we have done very well in terms of efficiency deploying investment dollars. If you recall the upstream capital efficiency chart that we used in an analyst presentation chart, our capital employed over prove reserves, clearly we are distinguishing ourselves relative with others. Paul Sankey : Okay Jeff because of time constraint, you again, mentioned return on capital employed. I really struggle with you losing money in the upstream on an earnings basis, particularly in the U.S., and how you reconcile that with the measure of the return of capital employed. Typically we don't look at that we look at the cash flow measure. Can you help us with the DD&A upstream particularly in the U.S. so we can get to the cash returns that you're making as opposed to? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : We have got a very strong portfolio in the upstream and remember that, we invest on it with a long term view that\u2019s informed to buy our long term energy demand outlook. All of our assets were managed to maximize the returns to the lifecycle with the objective we are maintaining, positive cash flow in low price environments. We will continue to focus on those things that we control cost reliability, operational integrity. Importantly, we will invest in attractive opportunities throughout the cycle that further enhance the asset profitability. And we see significant value in our assets. So yes, there is a low price, we are in a low price period like we have been in the past as I have said, we really design these assets to be very durable during a low price environment, it continue to generate. Our producing assets continue to generate cash flow and over the long term, we will continue to demonstrate industry leading returns on capital employed. Operator : And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Anish Kapadia : And I just had a question on your project execution. I think Exxon has clearly shown leadership amongst your peers on project execution over the last few years, but Exxon doesn't seem to have sanctioned any major upstream projects of note. The last couple of years, and do we see anything on the horizon to be sanctioned for this year, so I'm just wondering how do you intend to benefit from the quality of your project execution if you're not progressing with projects of the moment. Jeff Woodbury : I\u2019ll tell you that we will announce our FIDs after the company has made that funding decisions. So we really don\u2019t project it. But as in indicated just a moment ago, we gave you an insight through our analyst presentation and the F and O as to the type of projects that we are currently working and we really taking this down cycle as an opportunity to retest the value proposition for each one of these investment opportunities and there are some incremental benefits that we are able to capture through anywhere from design changes to different ways to execute the project given the service market to fiscal basis. So this is a good opportunity to step back and make sure that we are really capturing the most value from these investments. So we gave you some line of insight on the upstream and I\u2019ll just remind you that we have got 10 major projects still underway in the upstream that will startup between 2016 and 2017. As well as we maintain a very active high value work program and we gave you some insight on that during analyst presentation as well with a very deep inventory of opportunities. So, in summary I would tell you a large inventory of investment opportunities that are in various stages of planning execution when we get to the point where we've made a investment decision we will share that publicly but the pace would be consistent upon project maturity to maximize value and our prudent financial management, and now of course remember Anish that we've got a lot of a number of very large investments underway in our Downstream and Chemical business. Anish Kapadia : And just one follow-up more specifically on Nigeria because you've got a number of projects that have been in your project queue for a number of years, the South Oil field projects that you gave also Oxy field and I see you've added yet another project Aurora West into that project queue. Just wondering what -- what has kind of prevented you from sanctioning some of those projects it is has been around for a long time, and what needs to change in Nigeria for you to be able to go ahead with projects? Jeff Woodbury : I would tell you that some of these projects are a function of optimizing the design all away through to getting alignment with partners and establishing the right fiscal basis to go ahead and make the investment. Operator : And our next question will come from Edward Westlake from Credit Suisse. Edward Westlake : Just on gas, we've got oversupplied markets in the U.S. and Europe and in Asia. Now clearly the best cure for gas prices being low is low gas prices demand will probably pick up as a result of the time. Can you give us some sense of the magnitude of potential gas declines across the portfolio you exercise capital over the next four or five years? Jeff Woodbury : Yes you are talking with respect to our portfolio Ed? Edward Westlake : I'm really thinking about base business. I mean obviously we know that you've got some new projects coming on stream operated by others like Gorgon etcetera? Jeff Woodbury : Yes and you've seen in our volumes your gas volumes have dropped off impart and largely in the U.S. but impart that is due to a switch up from gas growing to higher value liquids drilling during this down cycle. Gas Ed we continue to be very constructive grown about 1.6% per year primarily driven by the power sector. The LNG we expect to triple from current capacity between now and 2040. So, I think we've got the long-term value preposition well within our site and it's just pacing those investments consistent with that demand growth to make sure that we capture full value for it but we've got a very deep inventory of gas and if you look at our improved reserves it's somewhere around 45% to 48% of our total improved reserves comparable part on our resource base and then of course importantly it add significant value to the value chain it provides an advantage feedstock for us for our steam cracking here in North America. You may recall that we are in the progress of progressing the expansion over a bay count for adding another 1.5 million tonnes per annum of cracking capacity and in conjunction with that adding polyethylene lines over at Mont Belvieu. So it's got a significant component of our future very deep inventory pace would be a function of demand. Edward Westlake : Maybe a specific on Asia gas you went I think from 4.1 down to 3.8 in the quarter. You mentioned PSE impacts in gas, maybe just run through what's happening there. Is it sort of customers are exercising low GTQs on the LNG contracts or is there something else going on? Jeff Woodbury : There were three major drivers there. One was planned maintenance, second one being asset managements and divestments investments and the third one being a price impacts. Edward Westlake : So you're not seeing customers exercise low quantity crude oil ounces? Jeff Woodbury : Well, I can't really talk about specific contracts but it's primarily driven by the three items I shared with you. Operator : And our next question will come from Iain Reid from Macquarie. Iain Reid : Couple of questions for you, you talked about the North American U.S. low 48 liquid productions falling, but ExxonMobil's price isn't fall. It's going up. Is this a kind of deliberate decision to invest counter cyclically? You talked about your long-term vision etcetera or is it something specific to your acreage where, you're getting more barrels out of your existing wells, because, you're contributing to the problem rather than the solution, if you're growing your low 48 volumes? And I have got a follow-up after that. Jeff Woodbury : I tell you Ian that as I said earlier that we're able to continue to invest in the down cycle, and that provides an opportunity for us to capture lower cost structure in the investments that we're making. So particularly in the lower 48 unconventionals, it's allowed us to hydrate the rig activity we're down quite significantly in terms of now we're down to about 16. We have reduced our activity materially. So continue to pursue the attractive unconventional opportunities that we have predominantly in the Permian Bakken, and we're getting great value for it, so it just shows the value proposition that ExxonMobil is able to provide because we have the capability to invest through the cycle. Iain Reid : Okay. And my follow-up question is on chemicals. Obviously very strong numbers in this quarter, the environment is obviously pretty favorable out there in terms of natural gas prices and the fact there's a lot of maintenance activities out there so lower production but looking a little bit further forward. There is more volumes coming on stream, your building capacity as well. Do you see this kind of chemical cycle at the peak now and then going into a bit of a trough toward the second half of this year and into next year or does Exxon have a kind of -- a more kind of positive view of the market. Jeff Woodbury : Currently, olefin and polyolefin have been pretty tight and demand is continuing to grow and it's outpacing capacity additions and I think that's an important investment opportunity, remember this is all our investment decisions Ian are really founded on our view of long-term demand and on the chemical side, as I mentioned earlier, we expect demand to grow about 1.5% above GDP. Now, I'll tell you that underlying demand growth across the olefin and polyolefin, the aromatics our specialties has been fairly robust, now sometimes the supply capacity additions are outpacing that and that's what you're seeing for instance in paraxylene but broadly speaking the demand is robust and it's going to continue to grow and we think it presents some investment opportunities. Iain Reid : Even with the growth in ethylene supply that we're looking at in the U.S. over the next year or so? Jeff Woodbury : That's correct. Operator : And we have time for one last question and that will come from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John Herrlin : Just a quick one for me Jeff, on Guyana, you have multiple structures in your lease area, in the event that you have multiple successes should we consider Guyana to be kind of an analog to what you did in Kizomba while back in terms of design one build many and then my other question is can you bring some of these longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of excess E&C capacities that I mean you did, discuss kind of how you're optimizing things but can you bring a longer cycle projects forward to take advantage of low cost environment? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. On Guyana, John, and good morning, John, I'd tell you that as I indicated earlier, it is really early days and we need to get a better handle of the full block potential but kind of the question around design one build many, I mean, we're doing that cross all of our businesses and I'd tell you that real modifier in that is design one put continue to get more and more efficient in that design and reduce the cost structure. So I'd tell you the even expanded globally in terms of how you look at concurrent developments in different parts of the world to make sure that you're fully capturing the benefits of robust design and execution, to your point around the engineering and construction contractors, yes, I mean, their backlogs are certainly light and we are very mindful about facing the investments to make sure that we maximize value but we want to do with a clear view on prudent financial management and maintaining our financial flexibility going forward but I'd tell you that one of the best opportunities that we have out there is the collaboration that we've been able to have with many of our providers and really encouraging them to bring forward lower cost solutions to see if we can make investments move quicker. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Woodbury at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Woodbury : Well, thank you. To conclude, I just want to thank you all again for your time and very good questions. It was a insightful discussion, I think for all of us.

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide two. Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Our cash flow reflects the durability of the integrated portfolio amid industry volatility. In particular, strong Chemical results highlight sustainable competitive advantages, including gas and liquids cracking capabilities, along with our differentiated product portfolio. Our financial flexibility enables us to selectively advance new investment opportunities across the value chain, and I'll provide an update on several of these new investments later in the presentation. Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic conditions were mixed in the second quarter. U.S. growth recovered modestly relative to the weak first quarter, and China showed signs of stabilization. However, Europe and Japan experienced slower growth. Crude oil prices increased, whereas average global natural gas prices decreased sequentially. Global refining margins benefited from improvement in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Midwest. However, Chemical product margins weakened due to higher feed and energy costs. Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide five, as indicated, ExxonMobil's second-quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. The corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $5.2 billion, down 38% from the second quarter of last year, reflecting both prudent capital management and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $5.5 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.4 billion and debt was $44.5 billion. The next slide provides additional details on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.8 billion to $4.4 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $5.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.1 billion. Debt and other financing increased cash by $1.3 billion. Moving now on to slide seven for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings decreased $2.5 billion from the year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs in the quarter were in line with our guidance, which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide eight, earnings decreased by $110 million, as stronger Upstream results partly offset lower Downstream and Chemical earnings and higher corporate charges. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide nine, second quarter Upstream earnings were $294 million, down $1.7 billion from the year-ago quarter. Sharply lower realizations decreased earnings by $2.2 billion. Crude prices declined by over $16 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.84 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $50 million. And all other items added another $450 million, reflecting reduced operating expenses, the absence of an unfavorable one-time impact from the Alberta tax increase, and favorable foreign exchange effects. Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production was comparable to the second quarter of last year at about 4 million barrels per day. Liquids production was up 39,000 barrels per day, whereas growth from recent project startups was partly offset by the impact of field decline and downtime events, notably in Nigeria and in Canada with the wildfires in Alberta. Natural gas production, however, decreased 366 million cubic feet per day, including field decline, downtime, and divestment impacts. Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11, Upstream earnings were $370 million higher than the first quarter. Realizations improved earnings by $960 million. Crude increased nearly $12.50 per barrel. However, gas realizations decreased by over $0.50 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and sales mix effects, including lower seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher downtime, reduced earnings by $280 million. All other items further decreased earnings by $310 million, including higher exploration expenses, lower gains from asset sales, and less favorable tax items. Moving now to slide 12, sequentially, volumes decreased 368,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, or 8.5%. Liquid production decreased 208,000 barrels per day, mostly from downtime events and entitlement impacts. Natural gas production decreased 962 million cubic feet per day on seasonally lower European demand. So moving now to the Downstream results, starting on slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $825 million, a decrease of $681 million compared to the second quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced margins by $850 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from improved U.S. reliability and lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $130 million. All other items increased earnings by $40 million. Turning to slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings decreased $81 million. Stronger refining and marketing margins increased earnings by $80 million, while favorable marketing volumes added $20 million. Other items reduced earnings $180 million, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange effects and higher maintenance costs. Moving now to Chemical results, starting on slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion were comparable to the prior-year quarter. Stronger commodity margins from both gas and liquids cracking contributed $150 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added $70 million, while all other items reduced earnings $250 million, reflecting the absence of asset management gains. Moving to slide 16, sequentially, Chemical earnings decreased $138 million due to weaker margins and an increase of maintenance activity. The next several charts will provide an update on how the corporation is advancing selective new investments across the value chain to extend our competitive advantage. Chart 17 showcases a good opportunity to add quality resources to our successful LNG operation in Papua New Guinea. ExxonMobil has a long and successful history in the global LNG business and is proud to have started up the Papua New Guinea LNG project ahead of schedule given its many complexities. In 2015, PNG LNG produced 7.4 million tons per annum, exceeding the original design capacity of 6.9 million tons by 7%. We continue to safely increase plant throughput and improve reliability at low cost. And in this regard, in June we achieved an annualized rate of 8.2 million tons per annum, the highest monthly rate since startup. To build on this success, ExxonMobil recently announced plans to acquire InterOil Corporation in a transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, which includes consideration of $45 per share to be paid in ExxonMobil stock. The agreement also includes a contingent payment, which is based on the resource certification of the discovered undeveloped Elk-Antelope field and is payable above 6.2 trillion cubic feet, up to a maximum of 10 trillion cubic feet. Finally, the agreement is subject to InterOil shareholder approval and the other customary closing conditions and regulatory reviews. This acquisition provides ExxonMobil access to six additional licenses in Papua New Guinea, totaling about 4 million acres. Elk-Antelope complements our existing discovered undeveloped resources, such as P'nyang, better positioning the co-ventures to expand the existing operation with additional LNG trains. The transaction will allow ExxonMobil to create unique value for shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea. And we look forward to working closely with co-ventures, the government, customers, and importantly, local communities to grow this successful business. Moving now to slide 18 for an update on Upstream projects and exploration activities, where we are advancing several attractive new investment opportunities, ExxonMobil is on track to achieve 10 major projects startups in 2016 and 2017, of which four have already initiated production. As shown in the photo, excellent progress continues at Hebron, located offshore Eastern Canada. The utilities and process module fabrication is now complete, and it was successfully loaded out in June from the fabrication yard in Korea for transport to Newfoundland and Labrador, where it will then be installed on the gravity-based structure. Hebron remains on track for a late 2017 startup. In Abu Dhabi, production is steadily increasing in the Upper Zakum field. Eight drilling rigs are operating on the artificial islands, where gross production has reached 100,000 barrels per day. Aggregate Upper Zakum gross production is currently about 670,000 barrels per day, and production is anticipated to reach 750,000 barrels per day by 2018. ExxonMobil also recently sanctioned the Tengiz Expansion Project, which is expected to increase crude oil production capacity by up to 300,000 barrels per day, with startup in 2022. ExxonMobil is a 25% shareholder in Tengizchevroil, the operator of the field. Now in offshore Guyana, we completed drilling operations on the Liza-2 appraisal well. The well test confirmed a world-class discovery, with a recoverable resource estimate of 800 million to 1.4 billion oil equivalent barrels. The test also confirmed high-quality oil from the same high-porosity sandstone reservoirs we saw in the Liza-1 discovery well. ExxonMobil along with its partners is progressing development planning activities on an early production concept involving a floating production, storage, and offloading facility, along with related subsea production systems. A final investment decision [FID] will be based on a variety of factors, including further Liza appraisal drilling, regulatory approvals, and market conditions. On July 17, we began drilling the Skipjack prospect, which is located approximately 25 miles northwest of the Liza-1 discovery well. This is the third well on the Stabroek Block. In addition to these activities, ExxonMobil recently entered into an agreement with The Ratio Companies to acquire a 50% interest in the Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana and will become the operator. Kaieteur is approximately 250 kilometers offshore Guyana in ultra-deepwater north and adjacent to the Stabroek and Canje blocks. Pending government approval, this deal will bring our total acreage position in Guyana to 11.4 million acres over the three blocks. Chart 19 showcases improvements in our U.S. unconventional operated portfolio. ExxonMobil is a leading operator in U.S. unconventional production. Since 2013, we have more than tripled our gross operated production from the liquids-rich Permian and Bakken plays. Approximately 85% of this is liquids. We have maintained a relentless focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency while maintaining high operational integrity. We have continued to reduce drilling cost per foot, implement efficiencies, and capture market savings to achieve substantial cost reductions. With longer lateral lengths and improved completion designs, per well hydrocarbon recovery has dramatically improved. Coupled with lower drilling and completion costs, this high recovery has resulted in a nearly 70% reduction in Permian unit development costs over the past two years. Our development cost per barrel is now $8 in the Permian and less than $10 in the Bakken. Additionally, we have successfully reduced cash operating costs to approximately $8 per barrel. As a result of these cost improvements, a large part of the Permian drill-well inventory is economic at prices around $40 per barrel. Over 2,000 drill-well locations in the Permian and Bakken yield a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel. This drill-well inventory equates to nine years of continuous drilling at 2015 rig levels, providing ExxonMobil the flexibility to progress profitable short-cycle opportunities and adjust activity in response to market conditions. And, as you can see on the chart, our economic drill-well inventory increases significantly as energy demand and prices improve. Turning to slide 20 and an update on our Downstream and Chemical businesses where we are selectively investing to grow higher-value product sales. First, we recently completed the expansion of our Taicang lubricants plant. This facility employs innovative blending technologies that increase operating efficiency and enables us to support growing demand for premium lubricants in China. In the Chemical business, we launched Exceed XP performance polymers, which expands our comprehensive slate of polyethylene products. This new product provides leading performance in a variety of film applications, including consumer, construction, and agricultural use. Exceed XP was developed using advanced metallocene catalyst technology, process research, and applications expertise. ExxonMobil recently announced a facility expansion of our Santoprene plant in the United Kingdom to meet growing demand for specialty elastomers for the automotive, consumer, and industrial segments. Additionally, we announced a project at the Beaumont refinery to expand ultra-low-sulfur diesel and gasoline production by more than 40,000 barrels per day. The upgraded facilities will employ proprietary scan-finding technology to remove sulfur and maximize octane. The corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We are evaluating a new project with SABIC to build a world-scale ethylene cracker and derivative units along the U.S. Gulf Coast. SABIC and ExxonMobil enjoy a long history of successful partnership. Most recently, we completed a joint specialty elastomers project at our Kemya facility in Saudi Arabia. The facility builds on existing world-scale commodity assets to help meet growing demand for premium synthetic rubbers. Chart 21 illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. As shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $10.5 billion funded shareholder distributions and, together with a moderate increase in debt financing, supported net investments in the business. The scale and integrated nature of our cash flow provide competitive advantage and the flexibility to selectively invest through the cycle. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. Finally, ExxonMobil generated $1.8 billion of free cash flow during the first half of 2016, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. Moving to slide 22. So in conclusion, ExxonMobil is delivering on its commitments and continues to create long-term shareholder value through the cycle. At midyear, the corporation has earned $3.5 billion and generated $10.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales amid volatile industry conditions, underscoring the resilience of our integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4.1 million oil crude barrels per day, and capital spending has been reduced 36% to $10.3 billion. As you just heard, we continue to advance our investment plans to extend competitive advantage and unlock value across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses. And we remain committed to sharing the corporation's success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date shareholder distributions totaled $6.2 billion. That concludes my prepared remarks, and now I'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. We'll take our first question from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Doug. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI : A few of your competitors have publicly committed to new capital management plans and performance metrics by which they plan to be held accountable in the future. And on this point, ExxonMobil is typically focused on industry-leading returns across the business mix, I think is the way that Rex [Tillerson] phrases it. And the company has clearly been successful in that area. But my question is whether that objective may require revision when you consider that none of your peers were able to earn their cost of capital, even with Brent near $100 in 2014. So we're in a little bit of a different scenario these days, and I wanted to see if there was an update on how the company may be thinking about capital management plans, performance metrics, et cetera, in light of these circumstances? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, I think nothing has changed in our strategy, Doug. I mean, we fundamentally keep focused on maximizing shareholder value and have always been and will continue to be measuring that based on a return on capital employed. As we have talked previously, Doug, I mean, the focus is on value. Our decisions are based on the value choices that we make. Now if we get additional volumes growth or we get additional market share in those choices, well, that makes it even better. But there's no change, we continue to lead on return on capital employed, and we maintain focus on the business fundamentals. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. And I also wanted to ask a question about refined products demand. Specifically, your refinery throughput and your sales declined about 6% year-over-year, but there were changes to the portfolio along the way. So my question is whether or not there was anything unusual about that data point just because it is minus 6% besides the portfolio factors? And also what you guys are seeing in refined products demand around the world? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Let me start with the second part of the question. And as you know, demand has been generally strong from gasoline products, and distillate demand is growing, but the issue that we're all faced with right now are very large inventories of products at this point. The way we'll manage that is like we always manage it. We've got to be the most competitive refiner in the Chemical business out there, and we'll continue to focus on the key elements to achieve that objective. In terms of the quarter-on-quarter performance, in terms of volumes, it's primarily due to plant maintenance activity. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Jeff, the year-over-year, first half versus first half, is it the same answer that it was really related to the changes in portfolio and turnarounds? Is that the way to think about it? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Exactly. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay, okay, thanks a lot Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you, Doug. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: My first question is on Guyana. It's clearly a large discovery. Can you share any preliminary thinking on development concepts, when volumes might be realized, whether there would be an earlier full production system? Is Kizomba B a good template here, and thoughts on adding a second rig? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I certainly appreciate and understand all the interest in Guyana. We're very excited by it, as we talked in the past. We're integrating the data that we're picking up from the drill wells and the seismic analysis real time. You can appreciate there's a good effort around development planning. And as I said in the prepared comments, the current plan right now is an early production concept as an initial start. It's probably too early to discuss too much of those details. Clearly, there has been some initial work that we've done for regulatory purposes. But as I said, we have a lot of work to do, and we'll continue to manage it. When you think about things like bringing in a second rig, that will be a function of a lot of issues. And when you do something like that, Evan, you want to make sure that you've got a really good understanding of what your prospects look like, and you understand the dependencies on them. You don't want to outrun your headlights on it. Good success so far, we're encouraged about the growth in Guyana and the development capability, but we want to manage this in the most effective way to make sure we maximize the value. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's fair. And my second question is another Tier 1 asset here. The InterOil transaction really has unique value to Exxon due to the PNG LNG brownfield expansion and the economics. Maybe more on the macro, what is your outlook on the LNG markets, and does the potential for multi-train expansions in PNG reduce your appetite for LNG development elsewhere over the next several years? Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Evan, I'd say let's start with our energy outlook. And it starts with our forecast that gas is going to grow about 1.6% per year from 2014 to 2040. And LNG will triple over that time period from today's capacity. So that really sets up the business case for us. Now, like any type of commodity, there are going to be periods of oversupply and periods of shortness, and we do expect that into the early part of the next decade that there will be some oversupply. But we keep focused on the long-term value proposition. And I've always said, the energy outlook is one of providing us the insights and informing us for our investment choices. Papua New Guinea, as I said in my prepared comments, has been just a remarkable outcome. The organization is really proud of the results, and we think we've got a really strong business there. And frankly, I think a brownfield expansion of the existing facility is going to compete very strongly for additional LNG demand in the future. I think we're very well positioned with the experience that we've got in country, the relationship that we have with the communities and with the government, our marketing capability. So I think the organization sees that as a very significant opportunity moving forward. Broadly speaking, as you've heard, we've got a number of LNG projects that are in our development planning stages that we think are going to compete for that long-term LNG demand growth. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thanks, Evan. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. How are you today? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Doug. How are you? Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good, thanks. I guess can I start with a follow-up please on Evan's question? I guess I'd like to switch to the additional exploration activity. I'm just wondering. I realize exploration is what it is. But to the extent you can share any thoughts on risk profile, how you've chosen the next exploration targets because previously that's (30:17), and that seems to have been pushed back in favor of Skipjack. So what is the read-through? What is your go-forward plan, and is there anything on risk profile you can share from the read-through from Liza (30:30)? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Doug, just to clarify, you are talking about just Guyana right now, right? Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, sir, yes. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : As I said in my prepared comments, we're drilling the Skipjack prospect. It is testing a similar play to Liza, with comparable resource potential. Clearly, Liza helped to derisk a new play in a new basin. But as you know, all exploration wells do carry inherent risk. We do have a lineup of other prospects in the block. As I said, we've added two additional blocks, one that's got a seismic survey in progress and the next one in which we anticipate once the deal is concluded that we will do the same there. And that will continue to be fed into our list of options, and we'll decide what the next best opportunity is to pursue after Skipjack. But right now, the plan is that the rig will move from Skipjack back to Liza for another appraisal well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's terrific. Jeff, if I may just add on this a bit, I think Mark [Albers] had suggested that you did [indiscernible] (31:45) indicators across the whole block. Would Skipjack qualify under that category? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I'd tell you that the seismic images are similar to Liza, and probably that's where I'll end. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks. My follow-up, a quick one, is M&A. Last down cycle, you guys obviously were very active. This down cycle is more asset focused with InterOil, it would seem. What are your thoughts on where the other basins (32:15), things that you could see opportunity? Of course, top of mind is Rex's recent visit to (32:21) and Mozambique. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Really nothing. I'd say from an acquisition standpoint that it's business as normal. We continue to stay very alert to the value propositions across our portfolio. We're not really focusing on a specific geography or resource type. But it's got to meet the fundamental quality expectations we shared previously, and that is it's got to compete with the resources we've got in our existing inventory. And we've got to have confidence that we can bring value to it and that it's got long-term strategic value that's going to be accretive to our returns. As you know, we've got the financial flexibility to do a number of things, and acquisitions is one of those things. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Would you care to address the press speculation in Mozambique? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Doug, I really can't comment on any market speculation. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I'll leave it there, Jeff. I look forward to seeing you in a few weeks. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you, Doug. Operator : And our next question will come from Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good morning, Jeff. How are you? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Sam. How are you? Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Good, thanks. I just wanted to actually follow up on the LNG outlook question. I'm not going to ask you to front-run your 2017 long-term market outlook, but one of the things that other operators are saying is that one of the big challenges in sanctioning LNG projects is that it's difficult to find buyers right now. But it seems like if LNG prices are structurally lower into the long term, maybe demand could accelerate perhaps faster than what the view was one or two years ago. And I was just wondering if you're seeing anything, if you have spot market exposure, if there seems to be increased penetration of LNG in some markets that you hadn't seen before, and if it was a function of price? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I'd say that certainly there are a lot of players in the LNG market now. But I would also say we have built a very credible reputation with the buyers. We delivered our projects on time, on schedule. We have an exceptional operations center that has been very effective in managing the contracts that are in place. So we've got a really good relationship out there with the buyers. We've got a good feeling on where there are market developments. And you understand that the approach that we take, these are multibillion-dollar developments, and we by and large are going to fund those based on long-term firm commitments. And that's how we manage these investments to ensure that we get an attractive return on such a large commitment. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks for the color, and then just a quick bookkeeping question, if I can. As you know, there's a lot of focus from investors on quarter-to-quarter sources and uses of cash. I was just looking at this working capital draw, and if we could get a little color on that, if it's going to reverse or maybe what was behind that. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : So the working capital had a $2 billion impact, and it really is a function of many different variables in it. But I'll pull out that one is a pension contribution that we had detailed in our 10-K this year, and then the second being just normal account \u2013 changes in account balances between receivables and payables. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks so much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Just a quick one on Guyana. You were very successful in Angola with the early production. Could you be producing within a couple of years, do you think, as soon as 2018? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : What we were laying out in our permitting activity is probably early into the next decade at this point. There's a lot to consider to make sure that we are maximizing the value for the resource owner and for the co-ventures. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood, Jeff. Thank you. Secondly, the PNG, would that be for your own \u2013 would the InterOil deal be for your own facility, or are you intending to continue with the second development? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, that's a good question, Paul. Clearly, that's a topic for discussion amongst the co-ventures when we bring it together. You remember, as I said in my prepared comments, that we've got our already established discovered undeveloped resources that we've been working on in order to underpin an expansion to the existing PNG facility. The Elk-Antelope assets obviously are an attractive add. When the deal is closed, it's a matter of discussion amongst the co-ventures and the government parties to agree what the best value proposition is for how we develop that. And I think there's a strong case to say that it's going to go through our existing facilities. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, that's very helpful. Jeff, finally the cash flows of the quarter. Was there any major distortions in terms of the operating cash flows that we should think about? And can you remind me, do you have a sensitivity of cash flow to a dollar change in the oil price? Obviously, the concern here is that for the quarter, cash flows are falling short of your combined CapEx and dividend. I know your guidance is for flat volumes. I assume you're spending at a level to achieve flat volumes. My worry is that maybe we need to see a much higher oil price, I'm thinking more like $60 a barrel to balance this cash flow versus CapEx versus dividend. Can you give us a sense of how the cash flows would move? And if there was any particular distortion in the quarter? Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, sure, Paul. I mean, there was no specific distortion in the quarter. I will say that, if you recall in the Analyst Presentation, we did provide you a perspective of cash flow neutrality. In there, if you recall, we used a range of $40 to $80 per barrel, and felt like we were very well positioned to achieve cash flow neutrality by next year. I think the organization is making some really good progress in reducing our costs and making sure that they're all focused on creating incremental margin. Your comment about price impacts on cash flow, we do provide in the 10-K some pricing sensitivities on earnings that you may want to go ahead and look at. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : I will indeed. And, Jeff, sorry, I've had a follow-up request from a client to ask you why is CapEx trending well below the full-year guidance. Right. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : So our CapEx guidance, as you all know, just over $23 billion. Year-to-date, we are trending below, and it's driven by a number of factors. One is the organization remains focused on capital efficiency. We're still capturing market savings. Importantly, we continue to execute our projects very well. We're not seeing major budget overruns or extension to the schedules, and that's an important deliverable. And then there are still opportunities to go ahead and delay some of our resource investments that in this down market we can restructure them to capture additional value. So those factors are what I would summarize as the shortfall year-to-date. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, Jeff. Have a good weekend. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : You too, Paul. Operator : And our next question will come from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Brad. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I was curious if you could go into the impact from the Canadian wildfires and also the impacts in Nigeria, what kind of volume loss you had during the quarter? And also, I assume the Canadian wildfires are no longer having a substantial impact, but maybe the outlook in Nigeria? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, sure, Brad. Well, I mean, for the quarter, it was about 100,000 barrel a day impact combined. The Canadian wildfires, I mean as you know, they're not impacting our assets directly, but we went ahead and shut down out of safety for our organization. This time of year we watch it very closely, but for the most part, we think it is behind us. Nigeria, you may recall that we did declare a force majeure in May for a period of time, and that resulted from a third-party operator that had an operational instance while they were towing a drill rig that, unfortunately, sat down on one of our pipelines. So we had to shut in the facility to help them remove that rig and then investigate the impact. More recently here in July, we had another force majeure. We picked up a system anomaly on the offshore export pipeline and have had some initial investigation. And we believe it was damaged due to a third-party impact. And we're working with the joint venture partner and our government authorities to investigate how to rectify that at this point. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks for that. And then I was curious if you could also talk a little bit about the new petrochemicals plant that you're investigating on the Gulf Coast. Just thinking about there are a lot of plants in queue ahead of you presumably before that would come online. So how do you think about the supply and demand dynamics of that? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, really good question, Brad. Let me start again with our energy outlook. We see chemicals demand growing about 1% above GDP between now and 2040. Over the next decade, we see that ethylene demand will grow about 4% per year, and that translates into capacity additions of about 6 million to 7 million tons per annum, per year, of additional capacity. So you can think of that as maybe four to five world-scale crackers per year. So once again, our outlook will inform our business strategy and our investment choices, and we see this as a really good opportunity. Remember that we've currently got a project underway in Baytown to add another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity and a corresponding project in Mont Belvieu to add derivative units to take it to polyethylene, in fact, metallocene polyethylene. This project would look at another world-scale cracker of about 1.8 million tons per year of ethylene. And that would feed, at this stage still early, would feed a monoethylene glycol plant and two polyethylene plants. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks for that color. Operator : Our next question will come from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi there. Just coming back to the gas theme, obviously you had Paris on the CO2 side. You've got a very bullish forecast on LNG demand. I mean, is this a general shift towards gas? I noticed you're sort of 60% oil, and it would have been even higher in the quarter with Nigeria and Canada. Or is this just knowing the assets just an opportunity to just get hydrocarbon at the low end of the gas cost chain? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : No, Ed. It's not a shift in our strategy in any way. We've been very consistent in it. It's a recognition of opportunities that we see across the globe in both the crude as well as gas. And again, I'll go back to my value theme. It's where we think we can maximize shareholder value. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then on U.S. gas price, I mean obviously there's a lot of noise about spot LNG prices and contract renegotiation, but obviously, there are time lags in the contracts as well, so you would have expected the gas price to probably go down a little bit. But anything funny that you're seeing in terms of the gas prices across your non-U.S. portfolio? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : No, not really. As you recall, crude prices got to a low level in the first quarter of this year. There is a lag effect on the contracts. We've got many different contracts. It's hard to imply that there's a standard that you can use to calculate the impact. But generally, you can see a crude lag impact of anywhere from three to six months. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, cool. Thanks so much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you, Ed. Operator : And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, Jeff, just wanted to follow up on the first question in terms of refining margins. And you guys have a unique perspective on this given the amount of capacity that you touch. Do you think the weakness that we've seen year over year in refining margins and versus the five-year average is a function of global demand? Or of refining capacity and utilization? And then how do you see it playing out over the longer-term? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : No, I think it's probably the latter. It's probably refining capacity and then, as you know, inventory build. So I mean, with very strong demand in 2015, good demand in 2016, I think the sector was ready for the demand moving into 2016. And you've seen that in the inventory builds. And going forward, just like any supply/demand fundamental, either the demand's got to grow or the supply's got to shrink, and you'll see the same type of fundamentals going forward. Our focus will be one of \u2013 again, as I said earlier, it will be making sure that we're the most competitive refiner out there. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: As you think about it geographically, which regions do you think will have to rationalize runs as you think about your competitor portfolios, to the extent margins do continue to weaken? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I'm not going to speculate on capacity utilization. Rationalization, we've said for some time, we expect to see across the globe, particularly in places like Europe and Asia. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great, Jeff. And the follow-up question on M&A here is I think in Rex's remarks at the Analyst Day, he had pointed to valuations from Exxon's perspective of U.S. E&Ps were challenging and the bid/ask spreads aren't there. If you could talk about the opportunities set as you think about M&A in the Lower 48, that would be helpful. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : As you can appreciate, Neil, the bid/ask is really a function of many factors, including the business climate and for us the unique ability for us to add value to it. There has been a pickup, a slight pickup. The longer that prices stay in this area code, probably the more ability to come to a win-win agreement. As I said earlier, Neil, really it's keeping focused on the full breadth of opportunities and trying to identify where we can come to a win-win solution that adds value for the long term. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate the comments. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you, Neil. Operator : And our next question will come for Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could just ask the first one on capital priority, do you have any rough priorities in terms of the use of cash as the commodity recovers in terms of balance sheet versus capital acceleration versus shareholder return? Is there a point that you look to get back to before thinking about restarting the share buyback program? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : No. If you go back to our capital allocation approach, it's all about making sure that we provide a reliable and growing dividend to our shareholders and at the same time continue to invest in accretive assets. The buyback program has been the flexible part of the program. As we've talked previously, the buyback program is considered on a quarterly basis. And it also considers things like the company's current financial position, our investment requirements, as well as the near-term business outlook. We'll make those determinations on buyback on a quarterly basis. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And in terms of debt reduction on that as well, are you at a place where you'd like to reduce absolute levels of debt, or are you fairly comfortable with where you are right now for this point in the cycle? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I think given where we are in the cycle, we've got significant debt capacity that we can leverage. Paying down debt is obviously one of those things that we will consider as we move forward. But we've got a very strong balance sheet. We're going to maintain our prudent cash management and we're going to invest wisely. But at the same time, we're not going to forgo attractive opportunities. And I think you've seen that here, as we talked this morning in the prepared comments. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And maybe if I could shift one to the U.S. onshore, we appreciated the slide that you had in there with some details on the Permian and the Bakken. Could you say how many rigs you're running right now in the U.S. onshore currently? And how should we expect to see you manage that heading into 2017? Are you at the point where you're thinking about moderately accelerating? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : So right now we're running \u2013 for the second quarter we were running 11 rigs in total. Now we're down to about 10. In terms of going forward, we want to be mindful of a number of factors. We generally manage this with a very measured pace considering a number of factors that would drive how aggressive we want to be in the near-term. You heard me say in the prepared comments that one of those things are the market conditions, but also resource maturity, learning curve benefits you saw in the prepared comments, the significant benefits we continue to realize in our Permian and Bakken drilling activities. We don't want to outrun the headlights and we don't want to miss some value opportunities. You need to have the right infrastructures in place. And then there's obviously considering the current supply/demand balance. So we'll manage it as we go forward, depending on those factors. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Okay. Operator : And our next question will come from Asit Sen from CLSA Investments. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Asit. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : So thanks for the color on PNG, LNG. I just want to get a little deeper, please. If you were to add a train, a new train to the existing facility, how much resource gas do you really need to underpin a train? Is it still sort of a 5 Tcf number? And remind us of your resource footprint there. I think in your opening remark you said 4.1 million net acres. What is Exxon's resource footprint in the region? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, I guess on the first one is, the resource required for a train is really a function of how big we build that train, and that's part of the development planning that we're going through at this stage. As you heard me say earlier, the two existing trains have a combined capacity of 6.9 million tons per annum. In terms of our total acreage, I don't have a number to share with you at this point. I mean, the IOC deal, as I said in my prepared comments, adds 4 million acres. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : And then shifting gears to International Downstream, Jeff, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on the current trends in Asia given emergence of Chinese teapot refineries? Did you see anything incrementally new in the first half of 2016? Are you seeing anything different? Or is it business as usual? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I'd say the latter, business as usual. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thanks, Asit. Operator : And our next question will come from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just wanted to ask a clarification on Paul's CapEx question. You're talking about costs trending well. Is there any specific reason that you wouldn't have lowered the full-year guidance for CapEx? Are there specific projects or things you're thinking about for the back half that would have it trending upward from a pretty consistent rate in the first half? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Well, I mean, Phil, we really provide guidance at the beginning of the year. Unless there's something materially different in our plans, we really don't change that guidance. Now the organization will obviously continue to manage it in the most effective way. If there are opportunities that come up on the horizon, we'll judge it against the value proposition and not be constrained if we think it's the right decision for the company. As I said, having said that, we do expect a downward vector. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, okay, fair enough. You did lower it last year, I think midyear, so that's why I was asking. I guess I'll ask one final question on the second quarter. Just given the magnitude of the miss, you usually don't miss by this much, looking back over the past five or 10 years. So if I take maybe the LNG lag effects or gas pricing, the effect of the production, up 1,000 barrels a day, do you have any rough sense of maybe what one-time factors from an earnings standpoint hit you in the quarter? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, well, I mean, I would summarize it on the Upstream side, it's primarily driven by three components : one were gas realizations; two were the non-reoccurring events; and then three would be the downtime that we talked about previously, particularly in Nigeria and Canada. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And any way to quantify it? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Nothing more than what we've shared in the prepared information. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Getting kind of late in the call, but I guess the question I'd ask, kind of getting to the, call it M&A or investment options as you look internationally. So you've announced the InterOil transaction. There's been \u2013 and I know you won't comment on rumors, but there have been rumors out there about moving more aggressively into Iraq, potentially Mozambique. Does any of this reflect an improvement in sort of I don't know if you call it a bid/ask spread on some of these big global projects, but maybe a view internally that things are at least looking a little more stable or that sellers are starting to be more reasonable about what they're requesting? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I mean, I guess nothing's really changed in how we consider acquisitions, as I said earlier. We'll continue to scan the opportunities, and some of these things come and go and they come back again, so they take a while to transact. And if it competes with our existing inventory investments, it's something that we're interested in. It's something that we want to try to progress and make a deal on. By and large, I do think, Roger, that resource owners do recognize ExxonMobil's capabilities. And I think that, particularly in a down cycle where the resource owner is trying to attract investors, I think that plays well for us. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, yeah, okay. I can certainly understand that. And then just a last question that hasn't come up in a while, but Argentina and the shale opportunity down there, any updates worth mentioning? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yeah, so you may have seen that we had announced a pilot for the Vaca Muerta in the Bajo del Choique and La Invernada block. It's a five-well pilot that we're progressing. It's underpinned by the December approval of a 35-year unconventional exploitation concession that we were able to secure. And the pilot will then allow us to better assess the full acreage potential. So good progress; it looks very promising. And you may have also picked up that we've got our XTO organization stirring (1:00:07) that asset as well to bring the U.S. knowledge and expertise into Argentina. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I did. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you, Roger. Operator : And our next question will come from Anish Kapadia with TPH. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Hi, good afternoon. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Good morning to you. I have a question going back to the InterOil deal again. I just wanted to understand why you chose to use equity, use your shares rather than cash for the deal. Just wondering if it's to do with balance sheet constraints, and especially as I think you're likely to get a significant amount of cash in from Total from milestone payments. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Anish, don't read too much into it. We have flexibility to do either, stock or cash. As you would expect, the final structure of a transaction is really a function of the dialogue between the seller and the buyer. And obviously, we keep focused on what the seller's needs are. But again, I wouldn't read too much into it. There are no balance sheet constraints with ExxonMobil. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Okay. And my follow-up question is on your U.S. gas production. We've seen some steep declines in U.S. gas production previously, and it seems to have moderated some more recently. I'm just wondering if you can give some idea of how you see that trending over the next few years and in the current gas price environment. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : If you recall, we are the largest gas producer in the U.S. We've got a substantial resource base that underpins that and a significant amount of development opportunities. If you think about the recent period, there has been \u2013 to be very transparent, we've had a much stronger focus on development of liquids opportunities, less so on gas. Longer term, we think about that gas resource base in a number of ways. One, as I said earlier, we expect gas to grow globally at 1.6% per year. So we expect in the U.S. is that gas will underpin increases in domestic use, and you've seen how gas has continued to grow in power generation, as an example. Two, we see that gas helping to underpin some of these petrochemical investments that we've been talking about like the investment we've got in Baytown and even the one we're considering with SABIC. And then three, that gas also underpins our ability to compete in the global LNG market and our anticipated increases in demand. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question will come from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Hi. Most things have been asked. But quickly with Skipjack, Jeff, do you have the same kind of seismic signature, not just the aerial extent of the image for Skipjack versus Liza? Do you have the same seismic signatures? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Yes, we do, John. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay, great. Next one, you said China stabilization. Can you be a little bit more specific? And that's it for me, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Are you talking about in GDP? John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yes. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : We're just looking at the quarter-on-quarter change in GDP, and by in large, it's been fairly stable. Fourth quarter of 2015 was about 6.8%. It's been on a gradual decline. First quarter of 2016 is 6.7%, and then it's estimated to be about the same level in the second quarter. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : I'll just add on China, John. Remember, overall demand products have been pretty strong in China if you look at crude demand and products. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : All right. Thank you, John. Operator : And our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Good morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Three quick questions. You mentioned that now you have 10 rigs in the U.S. Can you tell us what is the number of rigs you need to maintain flat production in the Permian and Bakken? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Paul, we really don't think about it as how many rigs we need to keep production flat. We really think about it from a full global portfolio perspective. And as I said earlier a couple times, we've been very focused on maximizing value. And on the short-cycle investments, one of the things we've got to think about is the supply/demand mechanics. So we really don't think about it from keep volumes flat. We think about how do we maximize value. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I fully understand. I'm not saying that Exxon thinks about that, but it's for our own benefit that in terms from an industry standpoint. So I'm wondering if there's a number that you can share. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : No, there isn't because we don't work it that way. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Secondly, in page 11 of your presentation, hopefully you talk about asset sales gain and tax benefits different between first and second quarter. We saw the difference in earnings. Can you tell us what is the actual sales gain and the actual tax benefit in the Upstream during first quarter, and also in the second quarter? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : So you're asking for the quarter-on-quarter earnings? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : No, I'm talking about the actual asset sales gain you report in the first quarter and in the second quarter for Upstream. And also what is the tax benefit you record in the first quarter and also the second quarter in Upstream? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : From an earnings asset perspective, in the first quarter it was about $80 million total positive. And in the second quarter it was immaterial. It was a negative $20 million in the second quarter. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, tax benefit? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Paul, we just don't share specific tax information in our business segments. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And final one, in M&A you mentioned that in order for you to go into a major concession, you need to ask the question, what do you bring to the table. Should we interpret that means that either once you applied whatever is the asset or what ownership, you will be the operator, or that you will be able to convince the consortium to move those assets into your own development site (1:07:23), like you may be able to do in Papua New Guinea? Should those be an important principle when you consider? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Those are certainly key considerations when we consider opportunities on the acquisition front. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Thank you, Paul. Operator : And our final question will come from Pavel Molchanov. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, guys, just one question for me. About a month ago Exxon was in the headlines stating its preference for carbon tax and then the selection fees, and I wanted to ask. Within Exxon's project economic planning, do you incorporate a future carbon price? And if not, what would you need to see before you would include that factor in your planning? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : Pavel, if you look in our energy outlook, which we've got posted on our company website, you'll see that we've included now for many years what we call a proxy cost of carbon. And over the outlook period out to 2040, that number grows as high as $80 per ton. But you'll see it in our energy outlook if you go ahead and take a look at it. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, I appreciate it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to today's speakers for closing or additional remarks Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Vice President, Investor Relations and Secretary : To conclude, I want to thank you all once again for your time and questions, really good questions. I think you get the impression that we've got a lot going on. The organization is very focused on the value choices that we've got before us. We're not being driven by specific objectives of volumes or market share, but one of value. And I do appreciate the engagement this morning, and we certainly look forward to our discussions in the future. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil\u2019s third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $2.7 billion in the third quarter. Corporation continues to deliver solid cash flow despite the challenging business climate. Cash flow results are underpinned by integration benefits from our Downstream and Chemical segments. ExxonMobil diverse product portfolio and flexible integrated manufacturing platforms remain a distinct competitive advantage through the business cycle. We maintain a relentless focus on business fundamentals while we continue to capture market savings in the current environment. We also remain resolute and are drive to implement long-term structural improvements across our integrated businesses. We are well positioned to create value in any operating environment. Finally, as I\u2019ll show you today the corporation continues to deliver on its operating and investment commitments. We are effectively progressing selective strategic investments while maintaining our setback commitment to safe reliable operations. Moving to Slide 4, we provided an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. We saw a modest global economic growth in the third quarter, while the U.S. economy improved relative to the first half of the year, growth rates slowed in China and remained soft in Europe and Japan. Crude oil prices were largely flat although volatile whereas natural gas prices strengthen on average compared to the second quarter. Global refining margins decreased as production continued to outpace demand, and Chemical commodity product margins remain strong, while specialty margins held relatively flat. Turning now to the financial results as shown on Slide 5, as indicated ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $2.7 billion or $0.63 per share, operation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion down 45% from the third quarter last year reflecting the cooperation's capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.3 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled 5.1 billion and debt was 46.2 billion. The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over quarter, cash balance is increased from $4.4 billion to $5.1 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $6.3 billion of cash from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash including shareholder distribution of 3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.2 billion, debt and other financing increased cash by $1.7 billion. Moving now to Slide 7 to review our segmented results, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings decreased $1.6 billion from a year-ago quarter due to lower Upstream and Downstream results. Corporate and financing costs were approximately flat to the prior year quarter, although below our guidance which remains at $500 million to $700 million on average over the next few years. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on Slide 8, earnings decreased by $950 million, and stronger results in both the Upstream and Downstream segments as well as lower corporate charges. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on Slide 9. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $620 million, down $738 million from the year-ago quarter. This result was driven primarily by lower realizations which decreased earnings by $880 million. Crude prices declined nearly $4 per barrel, and gas realizations fell by $1.13 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable sales mix effects increased earnings $80 million. And all other items added $60 million driven by lower operating expenses. Moving to Slide 10, oil equivalent production decreased almost 3% compared to the third quarter of last year totaling just over 3.8 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased to 120,000 barrels per day as growth from projects and work programs was more than offset by impact of field decline and downtime events, most notably in Nigeria due to third party impacts. Natural gas production, however, increased 77 million cubic feet per day, as new project volumes were partly offset by divestment impacts. Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on Slide 11, Upstream earnings were $326 million higher than the second quarter. Improved realizations increased earnings by $240 million. Crude realizations decreased by $0.30 per barrel, and gas realizations increased about $0.55 per thousand cubic feet. Unfavorable volume and mix effects reduced earnings by $40 million. All other items increased earnings by $120 million, benefitting from reduced operating expenses and favorable foreign exchange effects. Moving now to Slide 12, sequentially, volumes decreased to 146,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, or almost 4%. Liquids production dropped to 119,000 barrels per day, from downtime events, entitlement impacts and field decline. Natural gas production decreased to 161 million cubic feet per day as lower seasonal gas demand and reduced entitlements were partly offset by project growth and increased volumes from the U.S. work programs. So moving now to Downstream results, starting on Slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $804 million compared to the third quarter of 2015. Weaker refining margins reduced earnings by $1.6 billion. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activities, improved earnings by $170 million. Other items including the lower operating costs reduced maintenance expenses, and asset management gains increased earnings by $580 million. As announced in the first quarter, Imperial Oil is selling approximately 500 retail service stations in Canada. Today, more than 40% of these stations have been converted to the branded distributor model resulting in an earnings impact of $380 million in the quarter. Turning to Slide 14, sequentially, Downstream earnings increased $404 million. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $330 million. Favorable volume and mix effects, mainly from lower maintenance activity increased earnings by $240 million. All other items added to further 490 million, mostly from asset management gains and the lower expenses. Moving now to Chemical results, starting on Slide 15, third quarter Chemical earnings of $1.2 billion, decreased 56 million from the prior year quarter. Favorable volume and mix effects were more than offset by higher maintenance expenses. Moving to Slide 16, Chemical earnings decreased to $46 million sequentially or stronger margins partly offset increased maintenance activity. Moving now to Slide 17. Either delivering on our investment and operating commitments is our disciplined approach to investment and cost management. We continue to drive capital and operating cost down especially in the current business climate with year-to-date CapEx and operating cost lower by a further $12 billion versus the prior year period. We stride to build structural advantages into our business while minimizing total lifecycle cost. With our global procurement organization, we leverage our worldwide presence and scale of operations to effectively respond to changing market conditions. Importantly, this includes meaningful engagement for service sector on developing and implementing lower cost solutions. Across our operations and development activities, we pursue unique synergies and innovations throughout the design and execution phases that capture the structural advantages while ensuring high integrity in our operations. For example, by leveraging our fast-drill process and flat-time reduction initiatives, we realize cumulative drillings savings of $5 billion over the last decade. Today, these tools are delivering shorter drill times and improved performance in places like Angola, Guyana and Russia. By hallmark of our success has been our committed focus across the full value chain on technology development, not only to develop lower cost alternatives, but also to enhance integrity and liability, improve productivity, increase product value and minimize environmental impact. On Slide 18, we would now like to comment on the reporting basis of the proved reserves and asset impairments. Our results are in accordance with the rules and standards of SEC in the Financial Accounting Standard Board. Starting with our oil and gas proved reserves. As I indicated our reporting is consistent with SEC rules, which prescribe technical standards as well as a pricing basis for calculation of the reported reserves. This pricing basis is a historical 12 month average of the first day of the month prices in a given year. As such, the low price environment impacted our 2015 reserve replacement resulting in a 67% replacement ratio. This was the net result of natural gas preserves being reduced by 834 million oil-equivalent barrels primarily in the U.S. reflecting the change in the natural gas prices, offset by liquidations of 1.9 billion barrels. Given that year-to-date crude prices are down further from 2015 by almost 25% on the SEC pricing basis, we anticipate that certain quantities are currently booked reserves such as those associated with our Canadian oil sands will not qualify as proved reserves at year end 2016. In addition, if these price levels persist, reserves associated with inner-field like production or certain other liquids and natural gas operations in the North America also may not qualify. However, as you know amounts required to be de-booked on an SEC basis are subject to being rebooked into the future when price levels recover or when future operating or cost efficiencies are implemented. We do not expect the de-booking of reported reserves under the SEC definitions to affect operation of these assets or to alter our outlook for future production volumes. And you can find further details of our reserves reporting in our 2015 10-K. Now regarding asset impairments, we follow U.S. GAAP successful efforts and under these standard assessments were made using crude and natural gas price outlooks consistent with those that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities. This is different and as you see price basis for reserves that I just described. As detailed in our 2015 10-K, last year, we undertook an effort to assess our major long life assets, most at risk for potential impact. The price base is used in this assessment generally consisted with long-term price forecast published by third party industry and government experts. The results of this analysis indicated that future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets exceeded their carrying value, again this is detailed in our 2015 10-K. In light of continued weakness in the Upstream industry environment and in connection with our annual planning and budgeting process, we will again perform an assessment of our major long-lived assets, similar to the exercise undertaken in 2015. We will complete this assessment in the fourth quarter and report any impacts in our yearend financial statements. area stand : ExxonMobil continues to invest in this exploration activity to growth our prospect inventory across the globe, recognizing the opportunity presented by current market conditions, we are investing counter-cyclically in large scale seismic acquisition programs. Through 2016, we have acquired over 60,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic survey covering diversity of logical basins around the world, including Eastern Canada, Mexico, Guyana, Irving, South Africa and Mozambique. These new seismic data will enable us to evaluate recently captured acreage and ultimately identify new potential drilling locations. ExxonMobil also continues to invest in proprietary research in advance seismic imaging and high performance computing to enhance our ability to extract maximum value from seismic data. In addition to our active exploration program, we continue to advance several large scale developments. The Kashagan project in Kazakhstan achieved a stable re-starter production in October. Work is ongoing safely and gradually increased production to a target level with 370,000 barrels per day over the next year. In Australia, ExxonMobil has shipped four LNG cargos from Gorgon since August, and the second LNG train has now started. In Eastern Canada, after transportation from the fabrication yard in South Korea, the Hebron utilities and process module or UPM was safely offloaded at the Bull Arm fabrication site in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The top sites including UPM will next be mated with the concrete gravity based structure shown in the background of the photo. Hebron remains on track to startup by year end 2017. Moving to Slide 20, this illustrates the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash, and highlights our ability to fund shareholder distributions while maintaining our selective investment program; as shown, cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16.9 billion funded shareholder distributions and together with a moderate increase in debt financing supported net investments in the business. We continue to maintain our financial flexibility, a competitive advantage that allows us to selectively invest through the cycle and capitalize on unique opportunities. ExxonMobil generated $4 billion of free cash flow year-to-date reflecting capital discipline and the strength of our business. And we remain resolute in our commitment to pay a reliable and growing dividend. Quarterly dividends per share of $0.75 were up 2.7% versus the third quarter of 2015. Moving now to Slide 21, so in conclusion, ExxonMobil remains focused on creating long-term value through the cycle. Year-to-date, corporation has earned $6.2 billion and generated 16.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales, benefitting from the resilience of the integrated business. Upstream volumes were 4 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, and we anticipate that full year production volumes will be within our guidance of 4 million to 4.2 million barrels per day driven by our value based choices. ExxonMobil remains dedicated to capital and cost discipline regardless of business environment. Year-to-date, capital spending is down 39% to $14.5 billion, and we remain committed to sharing the corporation success directly with shareholders through the dividend. Year-to-date dividend distributions totaled $9.3 billion. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll go first to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : The first question is on the capital spending. You continue to see reductions sequentially in the CapEx year-to-date and it's obviously trending well below what you had expected at the beginning of the year. So, I guess, my first question is given the degree that\u2019s lower than your guidance, are you surprised by the degree of savings you have been able to achieve. And as we look ahead where are we in this cycle of CapEx savings? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, it's a real good question, Phil, and I\u2019d say that. First, I just want to recognize the organization for how focused they\u2019ve been on in particularly in the lower price environment continuing to capture benefits. We as you highlighted have been below our capital guidance yield, we\u2019ll be able to capture the many capital efficiencies, we\u2019ve continue to effectively respond to the market and capture market benefits. Importantly, Phil we continue to deliver the projects on budget and on schedule. And as I\u2019ve said, previously, we have adjusted the pace some of our investments in order to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value proposition given where we are in business cycle. If you look at our spending pattern, I would tell you that it is trending towards an outlook of between $20 billion to $21 billion. Phil Gresh : 20 to 21 for the full year? Jeff Woodbury : For the full year. Phil Gresh : Okay. And then as you look at the M&A activity, there is been a lot of M&A activity in the U.S. shale space lately, some of which has been acreage that's been contiguous for years. Maybe if you could just comment about how you\u2019re thinking about valuations in the U.S. shale today? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, Phil. We continue to be very alert towards there maybe some value propositions. We\u2019re looking for opportunities that would create incremental value. These opportunities need to compete with our existing investment portfolio and provide accretive strategic long-term value to us. We have been successful in over the recent past picking on bolt-on acquisitions particularly in unconventional business where we saw some of those unique synergies that added accretive value. We continue to be very alert to where there are opportunities, but as I said they really need to be able to add incremental value versus the portfolio that we currently have. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. Q \u2013 Neil Mehta : Jeff, I always appreciated your views on the near-term well micro, I know, Rex had made some comments on London, talking about a more subdued market over the next couple of years. Can you just talk about how you see the bounce is over the next couple of years both from the supply and demand perspective? And then I'll have a follow up. Jeff Woodbury : So, Neil, if you think back and look at where we have been here in the recent past, I\u2019ll start with demand. Demand has been generally reasonably strong, I mean when you think about a 10 year average demand growth of somewhere between 1 million to 1.1 million barrels per day. Since 2014, we've seen seeing demand growth in excess of that. So fairly reasonable demand growth in recent past, if you look focus now on the first part of 2016, we still continue to be in oversupply situation with production exceeding demand by about 1.1 million barrels a day in the first half. And as we anticipated, we are seeing conversions in the second half. But I\u2019ll tell you that as you continue to progress that we will probably end up this year oversupplied by anywhere from 0.5 million to 0.8 million barrels per day of supply. Now, of course, all this is going into commercial inventories. So, as you move into 2017, you see that we continue to see conversions maybe a little bit oversupplied in the year. But I had cautioned that we got to recognize, if they're still anywhere from 500 million to 600 million barrels of commercial inventory build since the end of 2013. That\u2019s got to come out of inventories at some point. And then of course, there is still uncertainties in the supply trend some of the OPEC countries as well as U.S. and conventional will have an influence on the supply demand balance. So, I think when you heard Rex's comment, he was reflecting on all these factors as to how that will impact price in the near-term or medium-term. Neil Mehta : Appreciate that, Jeff. The follow-up is related to exploration, if you could provide some additional color on both Guyana where there has been some exploration success with Liza-3 and the opportunity that you see in Nigeria that will be appreciated? Jeff Woodbury : So, as I said in my prepared comments on Guyana, we were very pleased with the outcome of the Liza-3 well. The well is located just north of Liza-1. It has given us confidence in terms of areal extent, the reservoir quality and thus our communication that we believe we're in excess of 1 billion barrels now. We are completing the Liza-3 well as I indicated, we will move on to an exploration well which is to the northwest of the Liza discovery. We are integrating real-time all of this well data and of course we took very expensive 3D seismic survey and all that\u2019s being integrated into our development planning. So in short I would say, we are very encouraged by not only Liza but the prospectivity on the block, and we see this is a high quality asset for the corporation. Pivoting over to Nigeria and the Owowo development, I\u2019ll tell that this is a continuation of initial discovery. The Owowo-3 well appraised part of that initial discovery, but also discovered new hydrocarbon columns in a deeper objective. So, again very encouraging, as I said in my prepared comments, we're thinking anywhere between 0.5 billion to a 1 billion oil discovery, and we will clearly integrate that into our development planning. I think I will also note that the Owowo-3 well is a really good indication of how the organization and its integration can able to continue to enhance the value proposition. We saw the potential to add additional resource. We drilled this deeper exploration objective and added significant more resource to the potential development here. So, I think it's a great example that about the value that bring from the general interest integration of the corporation. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : I had two questions for you actually, the first was around the impact of the forward statement that you have in the comments you've made about the proved reserves. Just trying to understand in Canada, it looks like in 2015 you actually had some fairly signification positive reserve revisions, and so I'm just wondering, if the sort of $7 change that we've seen in WTI from year-to-year is the primary driver on why those reserves could now potentially be at risk and is crude kind of an all nothing thing, where would be the full 3.6 million barrels would be nothing, if you just comment around that? Jeff Woodbury : The first point it as I mentioned we're seeing almost a 25% reduction in prices on a SEC basis year-to-date. And of course, we need to wait until we get the last two data points for that calculation. But given what we're seeing to this point, we felt it was appropriate to signal the potential impact from the SEC pricing basis on proved reserves. Yes, we did add some reserves in crude oil in 2015 and then the drop that we're potentially going to experience in 2016 is all due to the pricing basis. The second question, was, I'm sorry Jason was related to what? Jason Gammel : Well, it was really you've referenced 3.6 billion barrels in the press release that's related Kearl, is that kind of an all or nothing thing, in another words, is it the full operation or? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, for the most part it is. For Kearl, itself you remember, it's very-very long flat plateau, so it would be all or nothing. Jason Gammel : Sure. And are you positive on cash margin there right now? Jeff Woodbury : We managed all of our assets to maximize cash flow. I will tell you that the organization has done a remarkable job across. Remember, if I step back a little bit, Kearl is an advantage asset from the standpoint that we did not put an upgrader in place. We used proprietary technology in order to avoid that upfront capital investment and the subsequent operating costs associated with it. The organization has -- just what we are really planning to do is continue to improve overall reliability to mine operation as well as significantly reduce our cost structure there. And they will continue to work on it like we do everywhere, and we manage these assets in order to maximize long-term return and very confident that will happen here at Kearl as well. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next questions from Evan Calio at Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Maybe my first question, it\u2019s a different slide to prior Phil's broad question. Just given the success you had adding resource at the drill bed in Guyana, Nigeria brownfield opportunity in places like PNG, pretty significant opportunities. Does that really contribute to your cautious stake so far on the asset market or the acquisition market, maybe broad next time going to ask more for U.S., but your view on the global market and kind of proceed need and or interest? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. It\u2019s a good perspective, Evan. I mean, I would tell you it\u2019s not either all or for us. We\u2019re looking at work and we get the greatest value, but I think you draw out a very important point as it relates to how we manage the portfolio and that is we maintain an active exploration program that is clearly define at high grading the value proposition in our portfolio, and you\u2019ve highlighted some of the important resources. When we get to the point into assets life where we don\u2019t think that there is much incremental value and that\u2019s when we put it into our process of considering how else can you monetize that asset. But at the same time, we\u2019re also very alert to where there maybe some value propositions from acquisitions. And I think, the InterOil transaction is really good example. We discovered a substantial resource base in Papua New Guinea and we continued to our exploration activity, looking towards an expansion of existing LNG facility. And in addition to that where we saw the opportunity for synergies value proposition by acquiring the InterOil and specifically the Elk-Antelope resource that we could combine with our existing resources there, and with the great success we\u2019ve had in terms of the operating reliability and in the cost structure there, I mean just as a, it puts at right up top of the portfolio. So, think about all of our actions, Evan, as what is the best value proposition and that may become organically or inorganically. Evan Calio : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And as a follow-up on Liza, maybe just more detail here on how success affects your 2017 program across your various blocks. I mean, potentially adding other rig and any preliminary thoughts on that affects development plan that you filed in July, potentially adding a second FBSO and maybe just kind of cleaned up. There just any color on Payara or what you've learned from Skipjack? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So, as I indicated in the earlier question that, we\u2019re very encouraged with the progress that we\u2019re making at Guyana. I think you also know that we all also are very measured in our pace in terms of exploration and development. We want to make sure that we are leaving any value on the table. We also want to make sure in the exploration program that we don\u2019t get too ahead of ourselves. We want to make sure that we\u2019re fully integrating in the learnings into the regional geology, so that we upgrade our potential exploration program going forward. So, it\u2019s a pace program, it's making that those learnings being fully integrated, and then making that when we do discover additional resources or learn important information like we learned at Skipjack that we integrate that into, not only our expression program, but the scope of the full development. As it pretends to our initial phase development, it's been fairly consistent in the scope as it was conveyed in the application we filed for environmental review with the government, I\u2019ll tell you that this is real time, the organization is looking for ways to further enhance value. And as we progress that development planning and early engineering, we will learn more which will cause us to make adjustments. But very optimistic about the future in Guyana and we think we will bring a lot value to the government and people of Guyana. Evan Calio : On the prospect? Jeff Woodbury : On Payara. Evan Calio : Yes. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, so I'd say it is a similar reservoir section to Liza also a stratigraphic trap. Other than that they manage it's really too early to say much more. Operator : We will take our next question from Sam Margolin of Cowen & Co. Sam Margolin : It's been a number of years since people had to think about an OPEC cut and filtering through partners, can you just remind us potential impact to the business and I am thinking specifically of Upper Zakum and some other progress that start up next year within number states? Jeff Woodbury : Yes Sam, I am not really good at speculate on what OPEC might ultimately decide to do. I think what's important for you all to think about is that rest assured that, we are working to create incremental margin in the business. So, directionally, it could impact you on several ways. One, it could -- there could be retractions, but we're going to continue to make the value proposition. But at this point it's just too early to speculate on what we may or may not see from the agreement from the OPEC parties. Sam Margolin : Understood, thanks very much. And then I am curious about this evaluation you mentioned in the press release about another chemical complex in the U.S. gulf. Does that reflect -- I recall at the Analyst Day, there were plans to ramp U.S. unconventional activity that were unveiled and -- is that -- so, is this new chemical complex potentially a reflection of a view associated with that at all and maybe some view on continued at least localized length in liquids and other associated some just coming out of your oil fields in the U.S., or is just a separate economic decision? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I mean, it's, like most everything in ExxonMobil, that all start with our view on the long-term energy quite demand picture. And when you think about chemicals, the chemical demand growth based on our latest outlook as from an overall perspective, chemical growing about 1% above GDP. And from an ethylene perspective, we are expecting that chemical demand will grow just like you add -- need to add about 5 million tons per annum of new capacity per year. And to put that into hardware that would be three to four world-scale crackers per year. So, that really is assets of the value proposition. First as you know, we are expanding the Baytown complex to add another 1.5 tons per annum of ethylene capacity, a corresponding investment at Mont Belvieu, adding the derivative units to produce ExxonMobil's high value metallocene polyethylene. And then we announced to your question, we announced a potential joint venture with SABIC to jointly own and operate a complex in the U.S. Gulf Coast that would notionally be another ethylene steam cracker -- ethylene steam cracker produce ethylene of about 1.8 million tons per annum. And a corresponding derivative units that would be built alongside that, but I think the value proposition is there, I think we're headed the game in terms of making some world-scale investments in this and a very strong component of our chemical business. Operator : We'll move next to Doug Leggate, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : So, Jeff, the new CapEx guidance seems to be following a trend that indicated goes lower again next year, but you've also said that in the recovering environment you could quickly pivot back to unconventionals in the lower 40. And I think the number I have in my head is an incremental 200,000 barrels a day net to Exxon by the end of '18. Can you just walk us through where do you stand on making that decision and whether I'm characterizing it correctly? Jeff Woodbury : So, if you recall back in the March, Analyst Meeting, we provided an outlook through the end of the decade for our capital investment program. And if you remember, we had 2017 flat to down. And of course, the experience that we've realized during 2016 will be integrated into that and we'll update that outlook going into the next Analyst Meeting in March of next year. As you reflect on our ability to pivot, remember there's two components to our investment program, there's a very large component of being our long cycle investments, nothing has really slowed down in that regard and how we're working through the maximizing the value proposition for those investments. And as I said earlier we're trying to take full advantage of the cycle benefits. On the short cycle side you may recall and I think remember you're picking up with as in our unconventional program we shared in March that, we've got the ability to move fairly quick in order to capture higher price environment in our unconventional program to the order magnitude of about 200,000 barrels a day by 2018. So, we've got a lot of flexibility in our short cycle program and when you think about what really sets the balance between short and long cycle investment. The way I think about it from a short cycle perspective, Doug, it's really maintaining a program in a low price environment that allows us to continue to build on our learning curve benefits. You don\u2019t want to go much beyond that. I think as you try and also maximize value. So, I think we're very positioned if you recall in the second quarter of last year, our last earnings call, we shared with you some statistics around our unconventional program where we continue to drop the costs and we have a pretty sizeable ready inventory to go ahead and move on. Doug Leggate : My follow-up if I may on Guyana again, I wonder if I could just pull a little bit to try and clear up some comments that your partner made. So, really about next steps on timing, my understanding is that you\u2019re still on location on Liza-3 looking for deeper objectives. So my question is, have you -- are you done there -- have you found lost [indiscernible] water contract and maybe comment on your partners suggestions that the range of Liza is now at the top end of your prior disclosed range? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. I\u2019ll start with the second half of the question and that is, right now, our guidance is that we\u2019re likely above a billion barrels and really no more detail beyond that at this point, Doug. On the Liza-3 well, we did go ahead and deepen oil, we were targeting a higher risk deeper interval that had not previously have been penetrated on the block. What I would share with you is that the results were positive, and it does support the presence of oil bearing sands deeper in the section. But it is still very early this is real time evaluation that still ongoing and that information will be used integrate not only in the Liza but also in the rest of our exploration. Doug Leggate : So, did you find your water contact or is it another appraisal well block? Jeff Woodbury : Did we find in oil or contacting the deeper interval? Doug Leggate : No, no, in the original session? Jeff Woodbury : We were targeting, it goes back to injective of Liza-3 well, we were targeting water in the lower most sands, and we did encounter that water in the sand that we\u2019re still evaluating the results from the well, Doug. But it\u2019s suffice to say, we\u2019re pleased with the results and are consistent with our perjure expectations. Operator : We\u2019ll go next Brad Heffern at RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern : Just continue the probing on the deeper interval, is that included in the 1 billion plus barrel resource range? Jeff Woodbury : Well, to the extent that I'd say in excess of a billion barrels, yes. Brad Heffern : Okay. And I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail around Skipjack. Can you describe it all what happen there geologically and why it was ultimately a dry whole? And how did it inform the future drilling plan were prospects eliminated based on the results, was the drilling schedule changed? Jeff Woodbury : Well, Skipjack did not find the commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, but it did find the same excellent reservoir quality sands that we see in Liza. We have -- as we have been saying we have numerous additional prospects as well as different play types on the block. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by the success is today as well as the future exploration wells. There is really nothing more to share on Skipjack at this point. We are still doing some final evaluation and of course as I alluded to earlier, those learnings are being fully integrated into our exploration program. Brad Heffern : Okay. Understood. And then switching to Nigeria, certainly very large apparent production impact in this quarter, can you talk about what the current status is of your production there? I know you've at least reportedly recently lifted the force there. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So, when you think about our liquid shortfall versus the third quarter of last year as well as sequentially, it was all primarily driven to the downtime in Nigeria? And there were two third party impacts, the first one I think I may have mentioned in the second quarter earnings call. The first one had to do with the third part rig that was trending that impact or export line which had an impact on our production. And that issue has been addressed and the production is back on. The second one had to do with the third party impact line, and let me just say that we are still investigating with the government, we do not believe that was accidental or due to mechanical failure. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake : I guess that's been press release out of Mozambique saying that you have done a deal with [NI], so I am just wondering, if there is any comments that you can make in public on that? Jeff Woodbury : I know there has been fair bit of media interest in this. There is really nothing that I can comment on with respect to those media reports. You may recall also that ExxonMobil and Rosneft were given the rights to negotiate for a PSC on three offshore blocks in Mozambique, and we are actively working that opportunity that we're participating in 3D survey. Right now, they started up in January and it's still underway. Ed Westlake : Okay. And then second question, I mean I see a lot of ways that you can't get on the offence and we've just spoken about it a lot of them on the coal, maybe we haven't spoke enough about integrating value growth in the Downstream. But there is this issue around impairments, so if I may thanks but putting that on the agenda. One of the triggers that you have in your 10-K for impairments is operating losses. And also the U.S. has been an operating loss very much of 2015 and 2016. And then oil sands may or may not be an operating loss that we didn\u2019t get a disclosure, but let's say it is. I am just looking in your accounts, your net capitalized cost to your consolidate subsidiaries in the U.S. is 83 billion and then in Canada is $36 billion. So maybe just walk us through the approach that of how you would go through those impairments say the trigger was there? And how there would be cooperation will think about the type of impact you might have? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, well, I mean, as I said in my prepared comments Ed, we did an assessment in 2015 and in that assessment as I was very clear in my comments, we saw that the cash flow fully covered the carrying cost of those assets. As I indicated Ed, we are going to do another analysis very similar to the comprehensive assessment we get in 2015, and we will report on any results. But you can see some pretty good detail of what we go through and in fact maybe go to look at given your comments in our 10-K that really defiance the process pretty clearly. But I really don\u2019t have any more to share on the specifics of the mechanics that we go through. But rest assured, we are in full compliance with the rules and standards of both SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Ed Westlake : I guess we could take the RP ratio as a proxy for the years of undiscounted cash flow and then we can make our own forecast of how much cash flow you make it at the strip and compare that to the carrying value would be at least a first approach to it. I guess I just worried that if you de-booked reserve then you'll less reserve life to multiply by the cash flow to then on an undiscounted basis carry against the asset value? Jeff Woodbury : I don\u2019t have anything else more to add on this, Ed. We'll continue to be transparent on this. That was the whole purpose of putting the forward statement in there. It was a -- it's part of our normal planning and budgeting process to look at profitability of our assets and that sometimes causes us to step back like we did in 2015 and do a more comprehensive assessment. Operator : We'll go next to Asit Sen of CLSA. Asit Sen : So, two unrelated questions, first on global gas, could you remind us what percent of your LNG volume is not under a long-term contract and given slowdown in traditional Asian markets, particularly Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Are you seeing more new-term opportunities in other regional markets? And just wondering, if you have any incremental thoughts on European gas picture? And then I've a follow-up. Jeff Woodbury : On the global gas, I mean first let me remind everybody that from our energy outlook we have gas grown about 1.6%. And LNG growth just under three times where we are in current LNG capacity. As you go forward and we said it many times, Asit, that there are LNG businesses as a very important of our portfolio. I don't have a specific breakdown of our total gas production between pipeline sales and LNG contract sales. But recognize that a large part of our Asian gas coming from Qatar and Papua New Guinea is under long-term contracts and a good part of them are liquids linked. So, that's about all I can give you on that. In terms of the markets, clearly Asia-Pacific market is an important market for LNG. We've got a very expansive marketing organization to go ahead and identify value opportunities. We're primarily interested in locking in long term contracts either point-to-point or portfolio sale. You may recall that before we take a project to -- an LNG project to final investment decision that we will lock in a majority of those volumes on a long-term contract. We've been really developed a very strong reputation credibility with the buyers through our ability to deliver these projects on schedule and our responsiveness to managing through the contract terms, we've got a new operation center that we put in place in Asia-Pacific to facilitate the transactions with our many buyers. Asit Sen : And my second question is on Brazil, it appears Brazil is opening up in area where Exxon is not really involved, even Guyana fraction that you have now, could you update us on your latest views on Brazil? Jeff Woodbury : Brazil is a country that's really blessed with a large gamma resources and it's really high quality resource. Remember that how we approach our investment activities, just want to making sure that we get attractive returns for our shareholders. The trends in Brazil have been encouraging we continue to look for where there could be good value opportunities in Brazil and certainly if we think that we can get in engage there on resources or exploration activities that will be competitive on a global perspective to the other opportunities that we\u2019ve got in front of us, so we certainly will consider that. Operator : We\u2019ll go to next to Ryan Todd at Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks Jeff. Maybe if I could follow up on an earlier question in terms of CapEx trends and activity levels. You\u2019ve seen as it has been highlighted before I mean your CapEx here is kind of well over official guidance and even at 20 billion to 21 billion for the year is still relatively low and impressive at this point where you actually cover the CapEx and dividend here in the quarter. So, I guess first I mean I guess with your effectively breaking even in the current environment I know that this is one quarter, but how should we be think about how you manage additional cash flow in the 2017 in oil and gas as covers. How do you prioritize in increase in activity levels versus growth and distribution says reduction and leverage? Jeff Woodbury : It\u2019s a good question, Ryan. And I know we\u2019ve talked about before, but it\u2019s always good to update on this issue. As you know, let me just first talk about capital allocation, it's one of from our cash flow from operations. The first thing that the corporation wants to do is go ahead and pay a reliable and grow on dividend. The next thing is the remaining cash is praetors to a investment program as gotten into point where we believe that we have maximize the value proposition for investments. If we\u2019ve got enough cash to go ahead and invest in to fund an investment program then the remaining cash will be put forward to either stock buyback or share buybacks or paying down our debt. If we don\u2019t have enough cash as you\u2019ve seen us doing this in the recent past as we go ahead and further leverage our very solid balance sheet and debt capacity to take on some additional debt because the service cost associated with that debt is more than benefited rather the return we get from these investments. So, it\u2019s important to recognize that while we are very mindful of prudently managing our cash, we also believe it\u2019s very important for us to continue to invest through to the cycle and we do that in a very measurable way that we\u2019re not remaining value on the table. And therefore my comments I made earlier about making sure that we\u2019re optimizing value in the bottom of the cycle. Ryan Todd : All right. Thanks. Sorry, maybe the follow-up on that, you\u2019ve mentioned earlier on the call how you\u2019ve guys have done a good job I mean you\u2019ve generally maintained a decent amount of investment level on kind of your long cycle type projects, but when you\u2019re looking at this point that you\u2019re pre-FIB into a projects. Can you speak to the progress that you\u2019ve seen on large-scale and conventional projects in terms of cost deflation or evolution of fiscal terms towards enhancing in a competitiveness of this part of the portfolio? Have you seen what you needed at this point to kind of go and kick off the investment in that to continue new investment in that part of the portfolio or is that more that maybe to see at this plan? Jeff Woodbury : Let's bring it up from the component showing, first I would say that we want to make sure that all the learnings that we getting from our capital efficiency afford year-to-date or being in graded into those projects, and we have talked about how we do this to reduce the upfront capital investment, like I have talked in the past about progressing projects in parallels that we can benefit from the learning convinces, subsequent project. So capturing the market response, capturing the capital efficiencies that we build in and the low price environment as you highlighted there is a time to where we may want to go back and purchase some additional resources or reducing expression like in a Owowo, they additional resource to make the investment, the project investment even more robust. The last thing I had mentioned is the application of technology has been fundamental -- absolutely fundamental to our past success and into the future. And if you think about where you are getting those benefits across the full value chain I mean from the Downstream, our Chemical business where we use the proprietary technology to provide high value metallocene to our unconventional business with fracking technology. So, the application in the growth of these technology solutions has been a key element. And sometime some of these projects are really waiting on some of the technology work is underway. So we make great progress, I think we are very well positioned, we got a solid diverse portfolio in which we ahead and selectively invest into the future. Operator : And our next question comes from Anish Kapadia at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Anish Kapadia : Hi, Jeff. Just want to -- I had a question with regards to the way you look at your impairments versus the way that you look at acquisitions. Just want to square the fact that you haven't written down assets 2015, given you've got I suppose a fairly constructive view on the commodity prices with the kind of the opposing side that you haven't been dealt over last kind of year or so given that you haven't seen attracted enough assets from the market. Can you just talk about how those two things kind of work together? Jeff Woodbury : Well, from my standpoint there are two separate processes. Our asset management activity is a function of making sure that we are capturing opportunities as I said earlier at a competitive charge for existing portfolio. The objective here is making sure that we are growing shareholder value and if we think that we can acquire in asset like in our oil transaction then we can add incremental long term value, and we will go ahead and pursue those type of opportunities. Our determination of asset impairment which we talked about is a comprehensive process that we follow. And as I said the detail in our 2015 10-K and it's a separate process, it's not informing or influencing or asset management activity. Anish Kapadia : Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up on Nigeria, you have -- you made the number of discoveries in Nigeria kind of a number of things that you highlighted just potential developments. Could we expect any of these to be functioned for development in 2017 and if so which are the ones that are more progressed? Jeff Woodbury : So, Anish, as you highlight, there're a number of projects that we have in our portfolio that we've shared with you all in our S&L. And several of those have gone through various stages of development planning to capture some incremental value. I would tell you that just like any project, there're a lot of variables that we have to address and some of those variables may take some time. But we continue actively work with the co-benchers. Any government on the Nigeria portfolio, -- I think Owowo-3 well is a good example of how we've added some additional value to our portfolio and strengthened that project opportunity. Anish Kapadia : And then any of that could be sanctioned next year? Jeff Woodbury : Anish, we don\u2019t pre-communicate our FIDs, but the portfolio that we share within the S&L, we've got various stages of development planning underway in those projects, some of them are in feed; some of them are even more advanced like one of them like Tengiz has been FID. But we don't provide advance guidance on our FIDs. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess maybe coming back a little bit of to sort of broader cash flow, CapEx questions here, remember people have asked the question, is CapEx, is it troughing here? Does it go up? I guess to some extent that's going to depend on oil pricing cash flow, but how do you look at it in a world where prices have increased quite a bit from the beginning of the year? And then balancing cash flow, CapEx any sort of asset disposition plans? And then can you lay out any of the parameters for when we should anticipate a recovery in the share repurchase program like what do we need to see? Jeff Woodbury : Well, I mean, I really want to be careful not to speculate on what prices we'll do in the future. But I will tell you as we discussed a little bit earlier, that our investment -- our long cycle investment plans are progressing. When we believe those investments prior to point of maturity where we optimize on value, then we'll make an FID decision. Recall that, we're making those decisions by our long-term view on supply and demand. We're very constructive on long-term energy demand. And that's what really informing those long cycle investments, it's not what current prices are doing. Now having said that, we've balanced that with other factors that we may be able to capture some incremental value in the near term; and it causes us to paste those investments out on a longer cycle in order to make sure that we're fully capturing the value. On the short cycle investments as I alluded to earlier, and we want to keep activity levels in the down cycle commensurate with the learning curve benefits that we've been realizing since that we're enhancing value across the full portfolio. But it doesn't make sense to do much more beyond that. If you recognize, you want to optimize value. But as I responded to Doug earlier, we're very well poised to go ahead and pick up that in the short cycle investments and supported by the business climate and we\u2019ve got flexibility to do so. Roger Read : Sure. Well, the correct response on prices is always is just to say fluctuate right. But in terms of thinking about the share repo side of it, I mean is that you need to be at a point where you\u2019re comfortable or you can let say maintain roughly flat production levels and generate free cash flow or I mean how should we think about balancing production return cash flow? And I\u2019m think about the more normalize environment which should appears where headed to over the next year or two? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So, go back to my discussion on the capital allocation approach with the buybacks. That\u2019s determine in each quarter considering a number of backs including these company\u2019s current financial position, our capital requirements, our dividend requirements as well as what we see in the near-term business outlook. And it\u2019s a all those variables that are really inform the Company as to whether we believe it\u2019s appropriate to go ahead and distribute some of the benefits of the corporation back to the shareholder in a buyback. Remember, the corporation does not believe we should be holding large cash reserves if we don\u2019t have an immediate use to put it to work on and we\u2019ll go ahead and distribute it. Now, to be clear that consideration will also be mindful of the merits of going ahead and paying down debt if appropriate. Roger Read : Okay. Thanks. And just unrelated follow-up, regarding the Kearl assets, is the indicator there best to use a Bachmann price or the use a WCS price and that\u2019s just for us to do our calculations? Jeff Woodbury : Well, I mean well I think the benchmark is reason the WCS benchmark is quite a reasonable. Operator : We\u2019ll go to next to Paul Cheng of Barclays. Paul Cheng : Two quick one hopefully. For Liza, do you have already sufficient well data from Liza and Liza-1 and Liza-2 appraisal, if you need to meet FID on any production system? Or do you need additional appraisal wells? Jeff Woodbury : On the Liza, Guyana, at this time I don\u2019t think we believe that additional appraisal wells required prior to FID decision. But I would tell you that, as I said earlier Paul that, we will continue to integrate the data that we\u2019ve got and there may be a point where we step back and say given the risk profile we may want to put some additional data. But right now, it\u2019s not planned. Paul Cheng : Okay. On Permian and Bakken, can you tell us what is your number of rig and what is the current production? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So Permian and Bakken, I think we\u2019ve got a total of 10 rigs going in the third quarter. Paul Cheng : And what\u2019s there production? Jeff Woodbury : And production on a gross operated basis the Permian and Bakken is about 240,000 barrels a day. Paul Cheng : And one of your pretty large competitors that was talking about in the preparation of indeed that they\u2019re going to add some additional weight by the vendor. Just curious that whether Exxon have any preparation of the increasing activities at this point? Jeff Woodbury : Paul we are -- as I just said a moment ago, we are very well positioned to respond and we think it's appropriate but I am just not going to forecast whether we plan to add anything in the near term. Operator : And our next question comes from Iain Reid of Macquarie. Iain Reid : Just a quick question, I was intrigued to see a news report that Exxon is considering setting up a trading organization, and I was listening to the answers to question on LNG and point-to-point deliveries and coverage by long term contract. Can you foresee a situation where Exxon rather like some of your competitors actually takes some of the equity volumes itself from LNG development and then kind of redistribute via kind of other mechanism? Because other thing Exxon ever done that, it's always been a kind of a point-to-point LNG player or never kind of played in the kind of trading or diversion game. So be interested in a comment on that? Jeff Woodbury : Thanks Iain. I\u2019ll tell you that by and large we're price seekers. We don\u2019t typically speculate. We are taking positions in markets. Beyond that in terms of the inter working and how we want to manage that going forward, there is really nothing more that I can share. We continue to be very mindful from a LNG basis, very mindful what is of interest to the buyers. And I think referred to being open to the portfolio sales, but we are still very much interested in locking in those contracts on a long term. Iain Reid : Okay thanks. And just a follow-you, I just want ask you a question about the long-term on kashagan. Obviously, you're just ramping up the initial phase now, but what is the consortium thinking about in terms of going further on that, because the result is obviously could support a much larger level of production, and given that\u2019s you already got the facility on-stream, must thinking about in next phase of that, so that would be interesting? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, to be real transparent, I mean the joint venture company and the shareholders have been very focused. And I am sure you will appreciate this on getting the initial phase fully up on production and matching capacity. As I said in my comments that will be about 370,000 barrels a day by the end of 2017, but there is a second tranche to that subsequences to reaching 370 and that is with additional gas reinjection facility for gas that will take us to about 450. And certainly the joint venture company and the all shareholders are very focused on, given that we have restarted production and how do we move forward and really maximize value and that will include at the right time, looking at additional resource development. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mr. Woodbury for any closing remarks. Jeff Woodbury : Once again, I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. I thought the questions were very thoughtful and insightful. We of course appreciate your engagement. And I want to thank you again for you interest in ExxonMobil. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter and full year 216 earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. So before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our cautionary statements shown on slide two. Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our performance. ExxonMobil generated full year earnings of $7.8 billion and fourth quarter earnings of $1.7 billion. Corporation continues to generate cash flow through the business cycle to meet our commitment to shareholders and support investments across the value chain. In the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded dividends and net investments by a healthy margin. We are realizing the benefit of strengthening prices in the fourth quarter in our upstream financial results. However these results included a $2 billion impairment charge in the U.S. segment, largely related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the Rocky Mountain region. The impairment charge was the result of an asset recoverability study completed during the quarter and is consistent with the approach we took in 2015. Continued solid performance on our downstream and chemicals segments underscores the resilience of our integrated business throughout the commodity price cycle. Corporation continued to progress strategic investments across the upstream, downstream and chemical segments during the year, including execution of major projects, value accretive acquisitions and pursuit of high potential exploration opportunities. Moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Global economic growth remained modest during the fourth quarter. In the United States, the pace of economic expansion slowed relative to a stronger third quarter. We have stabilized in China and remain tepid in Europe and Japan despite some improvement in the quarter. Crude oil and natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter on anticipation of an improved supply balance as well as colder weather. Refining margins improved in Europe and Asia while seasonal margins in the United States weakened. And finally, chemical margins decreased due to higher feed and energy costs, driven largely by commodity products. Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. As indicated, fourth quarter earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.41 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed dividends of $3.1 billion to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.8 billion, down 35% from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflecting ongoing capital discipline and strong project execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.5 billion and at the end of the quarter cash totaled $3.7 billion and debt was $42.8 billion. The next slide provides more detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash decreased from $5.1 billion to $3.7 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $9.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The negative adjustment for working capital and other items reflects changes in deferred tax balances. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $3.8 billion. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by $4 billion, primarily due to a reduction in short-term debt. Cash flow from operations and asset sales cover dividends and net investments in the quarter by more than $2 billion. Moving now to slide seven for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's fourth quarter earnings decreased $1.1 billion from a year ago quarter as a result of the impairment charge taken in the U.S. upstream segment. This was partly offset by stronger upstream results and in earnings benefit in the corporate and financing segment as a result of favorable non-U.S. one-time tax items. On average, we expect that near-term corporate and financing expenses will be in the range of $400 million to $600 million per quarter which does represent a reduction relative to our previous guidance. Similarly in the sequential comparison shown on slide eight, earnings decreased $970 million. Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Fourth quarter upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion from a year ago quarter resulting in a loss of $642 million. Higher realizations improved earnings by $510 million driven by higher liquids prices. Crude realizations increased more than $8 per barrel whereas natural gas realizations decreased $0.32 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $50 million. And other items added $70 million driven by lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, fourth quarter 2016 upstream earnings totaled $1.4 billion, up $528 million from the prior year quarter. Moving to slide 10. Oil equivalent production decreased 3% compared to the fourth quarter of last year to 4.1 million barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 97,000 barrels per day as new project growth and more program volumes were more than offset by field decline, entitlement impacts and downtime in Nigeria. Natural gas production decreased to 179 million cubic feet per day as higher demand and project growth were more than offset by decline, regulatory impacts in the Netherlands, entitlement effects and divestments. Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings decreased $1.3 billion from the third quarter of 2016. Improved realizations increased earnings by $450 million. Crude prices were $4 per barrel higher and natural gas prices were up $0.41 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects contributed $230 million, driven by higher seasonal demand, lower downtime and project growth. Other items increased earnings by $90 million driven by favorable foreign exchange effects. Moving to slide 12. Sequentially, volumes increased more than 8% or 310,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production was up 173,000 barrels per day, mainly the result of lower downtime and growth from new projects and work programs. Natural gas production was 823 million cubic feet per day higher than the previous quarter. Stronger seasonal demand in Europe and entitlement effects were partly offset by regulatory impacts in the Netherlands and field decline. Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $110 million compared to the fourth of 2015. Weaker margins reduced earnings by $570 million. Favorable volume mix effects mainly from increased operational efficiency and production optimization improved earnings by $200 million. All other items added $260 million, mostly from asset management activities, partly offset by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. In the quarter, Imperial Oil completed the sale of its retail network. The sites are then converted to their branded wholesale distributor model resulting in an earnings benefit of $522 million dollars. Turning to slide 14. Downstream earnings were flat sequentially. Stronger refining margins outside the United States and improved volume mix increased earnings by $160 million and $100 million respectively. All other items reduced earnings by $250 million driven by increased maintenance costs and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects partially offset by asset management gains. Moving now to the chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15. Fourth quarter chemical earnings were $872 million, down $91 million compared to the prior year quarter. Weaker margins primarily for specialty products decreased earnings by $10 million while unfavorable volumes and mix effects further reduced earnings by $30 million. All other items decreased earnings by $50 million largely due to unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects. Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings were down almost $300 million sequentially. Weaker margins driven by higher feed and energy costs reduced earnings by $200 million. Higher volumes added $50 million and all other items decreased earnings $150 million including seasonally higher operating expenses and unfavorable inventory and foreign exchange effects. Turning now to the full year financial results, starting on slide 17. As I mentioned, 2016 earnings totaled $7.8 billion and represents a $1.88 per share. Corporation distributed $12.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx totaled $19.3 billion for the year, a reduction of $11.7 billion versus 2015. Throughout the year, we maintained a relentless focus on costs, capturing both structural efficiencies and market savings while maintaining operational integrity. These efforts resulted in further reduction in total CapEx and OpEx of $16 billion in the year versus 2015 when excluding the effect of the upstream impairment charge. As a result, cash flow from operations and asset sales was $26.4 billion. Turning to slide 18. Cash balances were flat to year end 2015 at $3.7billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in $26.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. The negative working capital and other impacts for the year were driven by lower upstream payables, deferred tax impacts and cash contributions to the U.S. pension plan. Uses included shareholder distributions of $12.5 billion and net investments of $16.7 billion. Debt and other financing items provided $2.8 billion in the year. Moving to slide 19. This graphic illustrates the corporation's sources and uses of cash during the year and highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. In a difficult business environment, the corporation continued to generate strong cash flow from operations and asset sales to support the dividend and most of our net investments in the business, supplemented by a moderate increase in debt financing. We maintain financial flexibility to continue to invest through the cycle in attractive opportunities. As indicated, shareholder distributions totaled $12.5 billion. Annual per share dividends were up 3.5% compared to 2015 and this marks the 3fourth consecutive year of per share dividend growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, ExxonMobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs. During the year, ExxonMobil generated $9.7 billion of free cash flow, up $3.2 billion from 2015 reflecting the resilience of our integrated businesses and our focus on the fundamentals. Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2017 capital and exploration expenditures to be about $22 billion. I know there will be a lot of interest in our investment plans and we will share additional details in a few weeks at our Analyst Meeting. Moving on to slide 20 and a review of our full year segment results. 2016 earnings fell $8.3 billion as the impact of lower realizations in margins on our upstream and downstream segments was partially offset by stronger chemical results and lower corporate costs associated with several one-time tax items. As a result, the full year effective tax rate was 30%. Now assuming current commodity prices and the existing portfolio mix, we do anticipate that the effective tax rate will be between 25% and 35% excluding the impact of any large one-time items. On this basis, our full year 2016 effective tax rate was within the new guidance range. Turning now to the full year comparison of upstream results, starting on slide 21. Upstream earnings of $196 million were $6.9 billion lower than 2015. Realizations reduced earnings by $5.3 billion as crude oil prices decreased over $7 per barrel and natural gas prices declined by $1.40 per thousand cubic feet. Favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130 million driven by new project growth. All other items added $310 million dollars due to lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of favorable tax items. Excluding the impairment charge, 2016 upstream earnings totaled $2.2 billion. Moving to slide 22. As indicated, volumes ended the year at 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day, down about 1% compared to last year but within our full year guidance of four to 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production increased 20,000 barrels per day as project and work program growth was partly offset by field decline and higher unplanned downtime, most notably from third-party impacts in Nigeria and wildfires in Canada. Natural gas production, however, decreased 388 million cubic feet per day. Growth in projects and work programs was more than offset field decline, regulatory restrictions in the Netherlands and divestments. The full year comparison for downstream results as shown on slide 23. Earnings were $4.2 billion, a decrease of $2.4billion from 2015. Weaker margins decreased earnings by $3.8 billion. Favorable volume, mix effects increased earnings by $560 million and all other items primarily asset management gains increased earnings by $920 million. On slide 24, we show the full year comparison for chemical results. 2016 earnings were $4.6 billion, up $197 million from 2015. Stronger commodity margins driven by advantage liquids cracking increased earnings $440 million while higher volumes added $100 million. Other items reduced earnings by $340 million reflecting the absence of asset management gains. Moving next to an update on our upstream project activities. So we continue to deliver on our investment plans with an unwavering focus on long-term value. Five major projects started up in 2016, adding 250 thousand oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. In the fourth quarter, Kashagan and Gorgon Train 2 started up and like other 2016 projects continue to ramp up to plateau production levels. Looking forward, construction activities continue to progress on another five major projects that will come online over the next two years. These projects we will together contribute another 340,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of working interest production capacity. Moving now to slide 26. Our focused exploration program continues to enhance our resource portfolio as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. In Guyana, ExxonMobil submitted the development plan for the initial phase of the Liza field. We continue to progress broader development planning activities based on a phased development approach. As part of these activities, contracts were awarded to perform front-end engineering and design. We expect to reach the final investment decision for the project later this year. Additionally, as I mentioned in the third quarter earnings call, the Liza-3 appraisal well successfully encountered an additional deeper reservoir which was being evaluated at the time. This reservoir is now estimated to contain 100 to 150 million oil equivalent barrels beneath the Liza field. Also, offshore Guyana, the Payara exploration well discovered hydrocarbons marking the second discovery on the Stabroek Block. The well encountered more than 95 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. Two sidetracks have been drilled to rapidly evaluate the discovery and a well test is about to get underway. The data will be analyzed in the coming months to better understand the full resource potential and development options. Now, after the Payara well test, the Stena Carron drillship will next move to the Snoek prospect just south of the Liza discovery. ExxonMobil also made two additional discoveries in the fourth quarter including the Nigeria Owowo-3 oil discovery announced in the third quarter earnings call and the Muruk discovery in Papa New Guinea. Both Owowo and Muruk are near currently producing fields which will enable capital efficient development. We also continued to capture new prospective exploration acreage. In Mexico's offshore bid round one, ExxonMobil and Total jointly submitted the apparent high bid for Block 2 located in the Perdido area near the U.S. border. In Cyprus, ExxonMobil and our partner Qatar Petroleum have been selected as the winners of offshore Block 10 in a recent tender round and we look forward to negotiating the production sharing contract for this high potential block. ExxonMobil has also been awarded an offshore prospecting license for exploration activities in the Gulf of Papua in Papua New Guinea. The initial scope of work on this block is expected to include seismic acquisition. Turning now to slide 27 and an update on ExxonMobil's U.S. unconventional portfolio. As a leading oil and gas producer in the United States, we have a strong acreage position and proven operational expertise in unconventional plays. XTO's daily production is currently more than 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day of which 38% is liquids. Our ownership and operating position enable flexible development and allow us to maximize learning curve benefits through the cycle. For instance, in the Permian Basin, where we operate two-thirds of our production, our average drilling footage per day has increased about 85% since 2014 because of continuous learning and application of ExxonMobil's proprietary Fast Drill process. We continue to focus on liquids growth through development activities and strategic farm-ins and acquisitions. Since 2010, XTO has grown liquids production at a compounded annual growth rate of about 11% and which currently represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. Moving now to slide 28. Our most recent acquisition in the Permian further strengthens our unconventional portfolio adding high quality acreage in the Delaware Basin and more than doubling our resources in the Permian to greater than six billion oil equivalent barrels. ExxonMobil agreed to acquire privately owned companies whose holdings include 250,000 net acres of leasehold in the Permian. The acquisition includes an upfront payment $5.6 billion in Exxon Mobil shares plus additional continued cash payments totaling up to $1 billion based on development of the resource over a specified timeframe. The map on the left shows our heritage acreage in yellow, acreage acquired in transactions in 2014 and 2015 in blue and the acreage associated with the most recent transactions in red. As you can see, the new leasehold represents a significant position in the heart of the Delaware Basin. Less than 5% of the acquired resource has been developed to-date, providing substantial opportunity for future growth. As a result of our proven capabilities, we are well positioned to maximize the value of this resource. This acquisition will add an estimated 3.4 billion oil equivalent barrels in multiple stacked plays, 75% of which is liquids. The highly contiguous nature of the acreage will also provide significant cost advantages by combining XTO's low-cost execution capabilities with proprietary technology from Upstream Research Company. We plan to drill the longest laterals within the play which will maximize per well recoveries and help generate market leading development costs. More than 85% of the wells are expected to have lateral lengths two miles or longer because the acreage is not constrained by traditional land lease issues. This transaction increases ExxonMobil's inventory of Permian drill wells that yield at least a 10% rate of return at $40 per barrel to more than 4,500 wells. We currently produce more than 140,000 net oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian and are operating 10 rigs. This is expected to move higher in 2017 as we begin activity on the newly acquired acreage. Moving now to slide 29. We continue to strengthen our downstream and chemical business through selected integrated investments in our facilities and operations. We recently completed investments in lubricants and chemical facilities in Louisiana that support our aviation lubricants business commissioning a new state-of-the-art jet oil manufacturing facility in October of last year. The new plant will use Group V synthetic base stocks sourced from facilities that started up last year at our adjacent Baton Rouge chemical plant. Across the fuels, lubricants and chemical value chains, we continued to high grade our portfolio and reduce complexity to efficiently capture market value while reducing operational risk and capital expenditures. In the quarter, we reached agreements to divest several downstream affiliates in Africa and South America. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, Imperial Oil completed their conversion of its retail business to a branded wholesaler model. This model benefits from significantly lower capital requirements while continuing to grow retail sales. We also continue to enhance our logistics capabilities by focusing on strategic midstream assets. We recently announced the formation of a joint venture with Sunoco Logistics that will expand access to domestic crude oils by improving transportation options from the Permian and Ardmore basins to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. In Baytown, at Mont Belvieu, Texas, the construction of our new 1.5 million ton per annum ethane steam cracker and associated metallocene polyethylene facility is progressing well with phase startup commencing in the second half of this year. Finally, ExxonMobil recently announced a new project at our Beaumont, Texas facility to expand polyethylene capacity by 650,000 tons per year. This expansion amounts to 65% increase in polyethylene capacity at the site. Together, the projects at Beaumont and Mont Belvieu represent multibillion dollar investments that will increase ExxonMobil's U.S. polyethylene production by nearly two million tons per year or 40% making Texas our largest polyethylene supply point. The new facilities will process advantaged ethane feedstock to meet growing global chemical demand. Moving to the final chart on slide 30. I would like to conclude today's comments with a brief summary of our 2016 performance, which is really underpinned by our sustained focus on value. ExxonMobil earned $7.8 billion in the year, while managing through a challenging business environment. Corporation delivered on its plan to produce 4.1 million oil equivalent barrels per day and maintained focus on business fundamentals. Volume contributions from our portfolio of new developments underscore our project execution excellence and reputation as a reliable operator. Total CapEx was $19.3 billion, down 38% from 2015 as we exercised capital discipline and investment selectivity and continued to pursue market and execution efficiencies. Solid operating performance combined with continued investment and cost discipline generated cash flow from operations and asset sales of $26.4 billion and positive free cash flow of $9.7 billion. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, cash flow from operations and asset sales more than cover the dividend and net investments in the business. Our commitment to shareholders remain strong as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. We are confident in ExxonMobil's integrated business model and our ability to continue to grow long-term value in any business environment. I will discuss our forward plans in more detail at the upcoming Analyst Meeting, which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 1. That concludes my prepared remarks on a very busy year. And now I would be happy to your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Neil. Neil Mehta : Jeff, I appreciate the incremental disclosure here on the Delaware transaction. That's where I want to start. As you think about that deal, is it indicative of the view that Exxon has that you see more value in, let's say, the private market than the public market? And can you just talk a bit more about the opportunity you see in U.S. unconventional to do deals? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Neil, it's a good question. I would tell you that I would not view it as being exclusive to one type of transaction. As we have talked in the past, we keep a full view on what may be out there that could be competitive with our existing resource base and accretive to overall long-term financial performance. You know, these things don't happen overnight. Several of these take many, many months to go ahead and put in place and not all of them transpire into an executed deal, but what's important is that it is a key aspect of our overall asset management program in order to high grade our portfolio with the view of our underlying mission of growing shareholder value. Neil Mehta : I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, Jeff, is on CapEx. I imagine we are going to get a little bit more color on this at the Analyst Day in a couple of weeks, but the $22 billion that you outlined is in line with what you talked about earlier this year, but up from 2016. Can you speak high level to what's driving the growth in 2017 versus 2016 in terms of CapEx? Is that cost inflation? Or is that higher growth? And then bigger picture, can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of cost inflation across your portfolio? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, Neil, as you indicated, we do plan on giving a lot more detail around our investment plans in the analyst presentation that will be just a little bit more in a month from now. As you indicated, the $22 billion that I mentioned is fairly consistent with our forward-looking plan that we provided a year ago. I would tell you that it does not reflect a year-on-year increase associated with cost inflation and in fact the inverse is true is that the organization continues to look for high impact capital efficiencies to drive the cost down and it is, by and large, a function of activity level. Certainly as activity continues to build, we will all experience some market pressures, but that doesn't relieve us of our fundamental objective of maximizing the value proposition and rest assure that the organization will continue to keep focused on what new solutions are there for us to get to a lower cost outcome and the organization is very committed to make sure that we are capturing those and really leading the cost curve. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hi Jeff. Good morning. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Phil. Phil Gresh : I wanted to start on the working capital and other headwind, $2.4 billion in the quarter, $8 billion for the year. It's a pretty big number. I guess I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate or break that down a little more between deferred taxes and some of the other items? And moving forward how do you think about the ability to lessen that headwind in 2017. Jeff Woodbury : Well, I mean obviously there's really two large components that are driving it. Obviously the changes in the working capital, by and large, adjustments in receivables and payables due to activity and changes in commodity prices and then the second part of other balance sheet items, some of that associated with deferred taxes. As I said, it also includes cash contributions that we made to the pension plan. So a lot of moving pieces, as is understandable. And I understand the interest, but that's about all the color I have for you at this point. Phil Gresh : Okay. And then in terms of priorities with cash from here, to the extent you have excess free cash flow above the dividend in 2017, is the first priority, with the trending balances where they are, would it be debt paydown or do you feel like you have flexibility to do other things? Jeff Woodbury : I think it's a function of the business climate and the opportunities that we have for ourselves. As you have heard us say before, if you think about our capital allocation approach, it's a commitment to provide a reliable and growing dividend to our shareholders and at the same time continue to selectively invest in our business with opportunities we believe are going to enhance the long-term return of the corporation. The excess cash, by and large, we don't want to hold large cash balances that we don't have immediate need for it. We will think about either paying down debt or buying back shares and that is done primarily on a quarterly basis. The corporation will step back and look at a number of factors like our current financial position, our potential opportunities to put capital to work as well as what we see in the near term in terms of the business outlook. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Good morning Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Doug. Doug Leggate : Jeff, I wonder if I could kick off with your capital guidance. I guess it's kind of a follow-up. But ask you if could you move it on to talk a little bit about the production capacity that you see that goes along with that capital, because I am assuming the Permian is part of it? What I am really driving at is, you have got a number of projects still ramping up, so could you give us some idea as to what the remaining capacity is of those ramp-ups? In other words, what would the delta be if those projects were running full out in 2017? And then I have got a follow-up, please. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Doug, I mean first observation would be is that you are correct that we have projects that started up all the way back to early 2015 that are still well within their development drilling programs are ramping up to plateau production rate. Some of these things could take 12 to 24 months to fully reach the plateau production rate. I don't have a specific number for you as to what is that incremental capacity that's left to ramp up, but I will also highlight that a number of those projects also are exceeding design expectations due to really strong management by the organization around reliability and reservoir performance. We talked about Papa New Guinea in the past, a design at about 6.9, it's now produced above eight million tons per annum. You have heard in the news about Banyu Urip which the development basis was about 165,000 barrels a day. We have been producing about a 185,000 and it is now under review to take it all the way up to 200,000 barrels a day. Again very, very strong operational reliability and very good reservoir performance. So the point I am making is above the additional ramp up that's anticipated from the major project startups, there is also another layer of capacity that we are building on based on the organization's focus on the operational capabilities of our assets. Doug Leggate : Okay. Just to be clear, Jeff, on the Permian piece of that, I think at the time of the acquisition you talked about moving to a 15-rig program. What's the starting point for that? What are you running right now? Jeff Woodbury : So you are talking about the recent acquisition, I believe? Doug Leggate : Right. Jeff Woodbury : So let me back up and first I say that if you look at the overall development of the new acreage, we see that over the long term it would support a multi-decade production plateau of about 350,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. So a very substantial addition to liquids production as well and in fact if I can put it in scale for you, if you remember, in my prepared comments, I said that our current liquids production from XTO represents about 12% of the corporation's global liquids production. If you were just to add on the expectation from the Delaware acreage, that would take us up somewhere between 20% to 25% of our global liquids production. So the point being is, it's a very material part of the portfolio. As I indicated, we have got 10 rigs running right now. We are planning on ramping up that activity over the near future. But what we would do is, commensurate with the leasehold development requirements, we are very, very positive about this obviously given the acquisition and we want to get to it right away. Doug Leggate : Jeff, I appreciate the answer. My follow-up is a very quick one. Payara, I think in Guyana, the limited disclosure you have given us so far, I guess, has raised some questions about potential scale. Is there anything you can tell us about relative scale or absolute scale of both the Liza and Payara reserve expectations ultimately but also like the development plan on both and the outlook of production system? And I will live it there. Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Doug. So, as we indicated in the third quarter, given the Liza-3 appraisal well, that really built confidence in a view that we have got at least a billion barrels of recoverable reserve. Since then, we have drilled a deeper zone that added additional volume, as I indicated in the prepared comments. Payara, we are very pleased with the outcome. We moved very quickly two drill additional sidetracks in order to better define the reservoir. And as I said, I think the next critical piece of information will be this well test we are starting right now. And that will allow us to size Payara. Now obviously, as we move along in each operational activity, that data is feeding our real time development planning effort to assess the full development scope of the block. And remember, we have got two other blocks that we will have to integrate as well. But right now, we are moving forward with the initial phase development. As we have said previously, it's 100,000 barrel a day FPSO. We do feel like that's a prudent step, very good strong returns and right now, we view that as just the initial phase. Doug Leggate : Okay. I will wait till the Analyst Day. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you, Doug. Operator : We will go next to John Herrlin with Societe Generale. John Herrlin : Yes. Hi. Two quick ones for me, Jeff. Regarding your CapEx, is that just strictly E&D or you are including the acquisition costs for Bass? Jeff Woodbury : Well, John, on the Permian acquisition, remember we are purchasing that via shares. So it excludes that share purchase. John Herrlin : Okay. Well, it would still be part of the costs incurred at the end of the day, but that's fine. Next on Payara, is that age correlative with the upper Liza pay or the lower Liza pay or can you not say anything on that? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. I really don't have anything to share on that at this point. John Herrlin : Okay. That's it. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Doug. Doug Terreson : Just for clarification, is it correct that the $2.1 billion in asset sale gains were after tax and included in the $1.7 billion earnings figure and either way, could you provide some guidance as to which operating segments that these gains came from? Jeff Woodbury : So the proceeds of $2.1 billion are -- you are asking about the proceeds that we had in the press release? Doug Terreson : Correct. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Those are before tax proceeds. Doug Terreson : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : And then those proceeds are primarily within our downstream portfolio. I would say about over 80% of it, it's in the downstream. Doug Terreson : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : And the largest part of that is in the Canada retail sales. Doug Terreson : Can you give guidance on after-tax? Jeff Woodbury : On the proceeds? Doug Terreson : Yes. Jeff Woodbury : Now I don't have any numbers to share with you on that. Doug Terreson : Okay. And then also, three of your competitors have taken steps to enhance their pay for performance linkage by changing the metrics that they are using for their business units to ones which tie to intrinsic value in the stock market and probably CEO pay too. And while your stock has outperformed some of these companies in the equity market over the years, my question is, how is the company thinking about P-for-P this year and specifically where there is a need for change given its rising profile as a corporate governance issue with investors? Jeff Woodbury : Well, if you remember -- you are talking about our executive compensation program? Doug Terreson : I am. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. As you and I have talked in the past, remember that a large part of our compensation program is based on a long-term payment schedule and it is intended in order to make sure that our executives are being held to the decisions that we are making over the long term. And our long-term incentive is paid over a 10-year period, 50% about 5 years. The remaining 50% after 10 years, really it's the later of 10 years or retirement. So some of us go even beyond 10 years, but it's really designed to ensure that our executives feel the same performance that our investors feel because when it does payout, it's paid out at the current stock price. Now I will tell you that the compensation committee does step back and look at the program periodically to make sure that it's ensuring, it's encouraging the right type of behaviors and it's recognizing the success of the corporation. For those that are listening about it, we have got, what we call an executive compensation overview disclosure that we send out annually that provide a lot of good detail about the structure of the program. Doug Terreson : Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Doug, just a follow-up on your question regarding the Canadian retail. As I said in my prepared comments, it was $522 million after tax. Doug Terreson : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : We will go next to Sam Margolin with Cowen and Company. Sam Margolin : Good morning Jeff. How are you? Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Sam. Sam Margolin : So late in the quarter, you finally got FERC approval for Golden Pass. I guess I would add that to the bucket in one of the later slides about de-lengthening your U.S. nat-gas position, maybe. So I was wondering, I am sure you have made comments on this before, but how do you think now in the new environment or how things have played out currently, how U.S. LNG competes with some of your other world-scale LNG potential assets around the world? And how do you think about that moving forward as you want to develop additional U.S. gas assets in the context of that? Jeff Woodbury : It's a good question, Sam. The best place to start is really thinking about it from our overall energy outlook and our supply and demand balances. Over the long term, we expect that LNG capacity or demand will continue to grow. In fact, almost it's up to like 250% of today's LNG net capacity. A large part of that growth is primarily driven by Asia. Now like most commodities, you are going to have periods in which there is oversupply and periods where there is insufficient supply. And we do expect that with the number of projects coming on that there are some projects where there is period in which they will see LNG over supply. Now if I step back from that that's, if you will, the value proposition and I step back, we have got a very extensive portfolio and I would tell you that brownfield developments that is incremental investments to existing operations like Papa New Guinea or even Golden Pass provide us economic advantage by lowering the cost by leveraging the installed investment. At Golden Pass, as you noted, we did get FERC approval. The one key step that we are still waiting for after many years is final Department of Energy approval of non-FTA export authorization. And we are hopeful that that will come shortly. But each one of these projects will be evaluated on their own merit. As you have heard us say previously, as it relates to LNG projects, we want to lock in a large part of that capacity on long-term contracts. And Golden Pass, within the whole portfolio of investment opportunities that we have, we are pursuing long-term sales contracts. But they all will be evaluated on their own merits. Sam Margolin : Okay. I guess my follow-up then, is on the same topic. It might be a similar answer on sort of an individual project analysis basis, but as you look within your 30-year outlook and a lot of energy demand globally is driven by gas and against the backdrop of early this year, the de-booking of some natural gas reserves domestically and an imperative to get those rebooked over time, what do you think is more preferable between uses of that gas for you? Investing in shipping it to these Asian demand centers via LNG? Or keeping it onshore and consuming it within your chemical business? Jeff Woodbury : That's a good question. It really highlights and talks to the issue of optionality. We are the largest gas producer in the U.S. Where do we see that gas going in the future, again stepping back from that energy outlook, we expect gas is going to grow about 1.5% per year. That's primarily driven by two things, one, power generation and the second thing petrochemicals. As you know, we have got a very integrated value chain. The anticipation is that resource will not only meet domestic growth and power generation, but we will also look at the utilization of that into our value chain in the chemicals business as well as, well, we started this discussion around LNG export, so optionality gives us tremendous amount of flexibility to make sure that we are maximizing the value proposition. Sam Margolin : All right. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : You bet. Operator : We will go next to Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning. Evan Calio : I have a question. Any outlook on future project returns, conventional versus your acquired Permian? And I ask the question in the context that you make a significant acquisition in one of the tighter energy asset markets in the world, the Permian. You discuss a relatively healthy future plateau level of production, while there's distress in asset markets globally in regions in which Exxon operates. So I mean just given the assets and these longer laterals you discussed, can you talk about how you think the future returns compete within your portfolio or how advantaged they may be? Jeff Woodbury : Well, from a general perspective, Evan, I would tell you that clearly the recent acquisition, predominantly in the Delaware Basin, is a very competitive. It really goes back to the fundamental objective that we are trying to achieve through acquisitions or through exploration or our investment program that is to make sure that we continue to maintain a focus on value accretive performance. So we are looking for investments that are going to continue to maintain our industry-leading return on capital employed. So certainly very attractive. We have given you sense for the economics where I think back in the second quarter we showed you some of the progress we have made in unit development cost, operating cost. We gave you a sense for the portfolio then, which with the Bakken improvement together, we had over 2,000 wells that achieved greater than 10% return, money forward economics, full and fully loaded on a $40 per barrel price. You add this acquisition into this, it takes us up to about 4,500 wells. So a very robust inventory. The long-term objective, thinking about the short cycle versus long cycle is one of making sure that the pace maximizes the learnings that we are integrating and captures a technology application that we want to apply in order to achieve these outcomes like the length of the laterals. But I would say that this acquisition and the investments that we plan under it are going to be very competitive to our existing inventory of opportunities. Evan Calio : Can you even mention how much of your expected CapEx, $22 million CapEx, is in shorter cycle, however you define that, whether offshore or onshore? And related, how do you consider the value of capital flexibility or cycle times in your gating process, either as a plus or a minus for a longer cycle project? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. On the first question, I would tell you that we are going there to provide some more color in about a month's time at the Analyst Meeting. So if I ask you to just to hold that thought, we will give you a little bit more perspective at that time. On the second one, the overall balance of short cycle versus long cycle, obviously we have got a very large resource inventory with over 90 billion barrels. We are trying to move that resource inventory at the same time maintaining a robust level of short cycle investments. Now, of course, that short cycle inventory continues to grow with all these acquisitions that we have been picking up. So that's done through our annual planning process. We look at the execution capability of the organization, the service sector and then we look at the fundamental cash management objective is to make sure that we have got that flexibility and a key element of when we share a CapEx objective, we have built in flexibility to the upside as well as flexibility to the downside. We know how to flex that program depending on what commodity prices do. Evan Calio : I appreciate it. Operator : We will go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thanks. Hi Jeff. Jeff, I note that in the third quarter press release, you talked about the potential for needing to take some negative revisions to proved reserves in the oil sands and clearly, at least in the quarter, you haven't taken any financial impairments to those assets. Can you talk about whether you would still view those proved reserves as potentially needing to be written down? Or whether the price recovery into the end of the year was sufficient to allow those to remain on the books? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. It's a good question. Again, I want to make sure that everybody's very clear that there is a separation between proved reserves reporting under the SEC rules and then the whole issue of asset impairments. And really what you are asking, Jason, is I think clearly the question about proved reserves. In the third quarter we indicated, because we thought it was prudent at the time given where crude prices were that we indicated that we were likely going to take as much 4.6 billion barrels out of proved and put them in our resource base. And I will remind you that I emphasized at that time that even though we make that transfer, there is no change to our operations or how we manage the business, those assets going forward. We will be announcing our final year-end reserves here in the next couple of weeks as we typically do. In short, we do expect to reflect most of the SEC pricing impact that we discussed in the third quarter, but I will also note that we anticipate that there will be some partial offsets to those numbers. So stay tuned, we will be finalizing that shortly and we will be releasing that information here in the next two weeks. Jason Gammel : I appreciate that, Jeff. And then just as a follow-up, the InterOil acquisition that you announced this year, I am afraid I am a little bit lost on the process for actually completing the InterOil transaction. Can you talk about what is still outstanding there in order to get that deal done? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So we are going back through the process following a decision by Canadian courts and we have put in place a new amended agreement between InterOil and ExxonMobil. And I will just remind everybody that in the first process through, the InterOil Board fully unanimously approved this transaction and shareholders approved it by over 80%. So we are going back through the process and right now there is a shareholder vote anticipated in the middle of February. And then as in the last cycle through this, we will need to go back to the Yukon courts to make a final ruling on the offer and then hopefully close thereafter. Jason Gammel : Great. Thanks Jeff. I appreciate that. Operator : We will go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could have a couple of quick follow-ups on capital budget. And I realize you are giving more details next month. But how should we think about capital allocation for the Lower 48 business with the addition of the Permian acquisition? Does that highlight a growing relative share of the capital budget by the U.S. on shore? Is it additive to your existing activity? Or should we expect to see the capital diverted away from areas like the Bakken in Oklahoma and be replaced by activity in the Permian? Jeff Woodbury : Well, Ryan, we will certainly provide more color here in a month or so. But I mean, directionally, it's a fairly sizable acquisition that we are making in the Permian. We feel good about our acreage position in the other unconventional basins. I showed you a map where we have got a meaningful presence in everyone of them. As an indicative guidance, I would tell you that it's likely going to add additional CapEx to our short cycle investments in order to move forward on the acreage that we have picked up in acquisition. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on 2016 CapEx, which came in quite a bit lower than guidance early in the year. Any comments on what were the primary drivers? Is that cost deflation, deferral of activity, change in any expected scope in spend? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Thanks for asking the question, Ryan, because I think it does reflect very well on how the corporation responded and particularly our people and their focus on recognizing that we are in a down cycle and we have got a great opportunity to take advantage during that down cycle. I would say that it really is a function of a number of things. One is and it all is underpinned by our very strong focus around capital discipline. But it comes down to capital efficiency opportunities that we are able to continue to capture, regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle. It includes market capture. We all know that the service sector and the related costs have dropped materially. Also importantly it has to do with the very strong project execution performance on our operated projects, most of which coming in on-budget and on-cost. And then there was an element of how we paced our projects for several reasons. One, recognizing the business climate, wanting to stay within our means. And two, in a low price environment, there is unique value that we are able to capture by going back and recycling through the development planning process on some of these projects to try to do things like reduce the cost structure, add additional resource to increase resource density, but it really is a opportunity in the down cycle to go ahead and add incremental value to those future investment. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Hi Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Paul. Paul Sankey : Jeff, with the changes in Washington, I just wondered what Exxon has done to, firstly, I assume you guys are pro lifting sanctions on Russia. Secondly, I assume that you would be anti the border adjusted tax. And then finally, can you make any comments about the impact on your operations in Iraq from the recent limitations on travel there? I wondered if that was going to -- I assume that's going to directly impact you. Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. I guess a couple of comments. We will continue to advocate for many of the areas you talked about, advocate for free market principles. When it comes down to the important discussion that's happening in Congress in the current administration around the tax code, we believe the tax code should be globally competitive. It should be predictable, stable, providing investment certainty and not picking winners and losers. So I mean, we will continue to stay principle based in our view on those matters. With respect to Russia, we will continue to fully comply with the existing sanctions and I am not going to speculate when or if they are fully satisfied and removed in the future. And then on Iraq and more broadly speaking some of the issues associated with decisions taken in the U.S., a key aspect wherever we are around the world, including Iraq, is the security of our people and our contractors and we have very dedicated effort within the organization to ensure that we are trying to stay in front of potential threats that the organization needs to respond to in order to ensure the safety and security of our assets and people. So I would rather not talk about specifics, but I will tell you that we are monitoring the situation very closely. Paul Sankey : Understood. Jeff, if I could completely change subject, the President of Guyana was commenting earlier in the week that we could see production startup in 2019 from Liza. Is that reasonable, do you think? We have also obviously heard from Hess about a final investment decision this year. And if we look back to what you did in Angola as an example of your speed with which you can get these things up and running with the idea of getting very early cash flow, I wondered if you could handicap the chances that we do see first production much sooner than the, I think you have been talking more 2021? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. It's a good question. Listen, I think first and foremost is that we are going to work with our co-ventures and the government to move this project along in the most efficient and expedient way. And all stakeholders have a role in deciding how this project moves forward. And we certainly understand the resource owners' interest and I will tell you, we are very attuned to it. As I indicated in my prepared comments, we think it is reasonable that the initial phase will move forward to an FID decision later this year. The guidance that we have been providing as well as consistent with the regulatory filings says that the initial phase would startup in 2020. Paul Sankey : Got it, Jeff. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : You are welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Asit Sen with CLSA Americas. Asit Sen : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning Asit. Asit Sen : So thanks for the color on the short cycle versus long cycle. I just wanted to make sure I got the Permian numbers right. So the 140,000 barrels a day production now and your comment on the 350,000 barrels a day of plateau production from the recent Delaware acquisition, what time frame are we looking at? Jeff Woodbury : Well, we have yet to share the specifics around the buildup of that. But as I indicated, Asit, we want to get at it quickly. But the 350,000 potential and that's oil equivalent barrels per day, we believe is a reasonable investment program that could be maintained over multi-decades. Asit Sen : Got you. Okay. And my quick question on the new project startup, Barzan, is that a 2017 startup? And could you remind us on the working interest that you have there? 7% is that's what I have. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Our working interest is 7% and you really need to talk to the operator RasGas on specifics around the project. Asit Sen : Great. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Welcome. Operator : We will go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays. Moses Sutton : Hi. This is Moses Sutton, on for Paul. A quick question on the impairment charges. Have you completed the review of the entire portfolio? Or are certain assets still under review in 2017? Jeff Woodbury : We have completed the review of the entire portfolio. Moses Sutton : Great. Thank you. That's it from us. Jeff Woodbury : You are welcome. Operator : We will go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Hi Jeff. I also had a question on the impairment. If you look back at your most recent energy outlook, it looks like you have made some quite big changes around the expectation on North American tight oil and gas. Is it possible to relate those changes back to today's impairment decision? It feels like you expect there's going to be a lot of growth in associated gas, for instance. Jeff Woodbury : Well, I mean it's good question, Alastair, but I would tell you, the first point I would make is the reason why we do an annual updated energy outlook is really to make sure that we are most informed about the fundamental building blocks that really underpin that demand projection. The changes that you are asking about is really a function of a number of factors. It's not just energy outlook. We do this in conjunction with our annual budget and plans process. And it also is of the function as part of the energy outlook is looking at the competitiveness of different resources that underpin that demand outlook. So it's a number of factors that will drive our decisions and ultimately the choices that we make. Alastair Syme : Thank you. As a follow-up, can I ask, can you explain what non-U.S. tax effects are on the corporate items? Are these upstream or downstream items? Jeff Woodbury : The non-U.S. tax items are really across a number of the business segments, but the largest in the fourth quarter were primarily in the upstream business. Alastair Syme : Is it possible to get any color what they relate to? Jeff Woodbury : No, we don't have any additional information to share. Alastair Syme : Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : You are welcome. Operator : We will go next to Brendan Warren with BMO Capital Markets. Brendan Warren : Thanks Jeff. Just first question, just on those five major project startups. You flagged 2017 into 2018, particularly with Hebron and Sakhalin that you do operate. Are they still in 2017, recognizing Hebron most recently said it was on track for end-2017. I have a follow-up as well. Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. That's correct. They are currently on plan to achieve those objectives. Brendan Warren : Okay. So they are both in before end-2017. And then my follow-up refers and you would probably say defer this to the capital markets day, but if I refer back to slide 33 from the capital markets day, you had given guidance of cash flow from operations and asset sales for 2016 with a range at $40 a barrel to $80 a barrel. It looks like at $45 average for this year, you have just come in where the $40 a barrel line should be. I am trying to reconcile, you had a weaker cash flow number for 2016. And whether that changes your view for 2017 in terms of cash flow from operations? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Brendan, a good question. An important dialog that we think is something that we should be talking to and we will update that chart you are referring to in the upcoming Analyst Day here within a month and be ready to talk more about it with our current views. Brendan Warren : Okay. Thanks Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Welcome. Operator : We will go next to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Ed Westlake : Yes. Good morning at top of the hour here. Two questions, I guess. Firstly, decline rates. I mean you guys have done very well on the production side to minimize base decline. You have got long duration assets in a number of geographies. Maybe just a quick update as far out as you could go on expected decline rate on the base business. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So we assess our long-term decline rate over every year and in fact, it's in our 10-K. And what we have had in terms of a decline rate here in the recent past, last couple of years, has been 3%. And let me just qualify that 3% as being that does not include project activity. So if we were to stop our investment program, that's what we would have. Ed Westlake : Yes. Jeff Woodbury : Okay. Ed Westlake : And then we haven't really had a conversation around OpEx and margins, maybe deferred tax maybe to the prior question on cash flow as you go forward, but maybe just a word on how much more savings you can get on OpEx? The new projects, are they accretive to margins? And then what you expect to happen to deferred taxes as prices bump up a little here? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. A really good question in terms of OpEx and how we are managing that. I would tell you that we are never satisfied. We clearly understand there's been a lot of progress here over the last two years, but I can tell you that the organization doesn't believe status quo is sufficient. As I alluded to previously, we will continue to look for structural opportunities. We will continue to be very focused on our organizational effectiveness. And importantly, we will continue to work with the service sector to come up with lower cost, higher quality opportunities. And I am sure if the activity continues to build, there is going to be market pressures, but we are going to continue to work against those market pressures to capture incremental value. On deferred income taxes in the future, there's really nothing more I can share with you. You can appreciate some of this has to do with the current low price environment that have been through here last couple years. Ed Westlake : And margin should also improve with the new projects coming on, presumably? Jeff Woodbury : Well, that's the objective of the investment program. Thanks, Ed. Operator : We will go next to Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP. Theepan Jothilingam : Yes. Hi. Good morning Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two actually. Firstly, could you talk about, I know you are intending to issue equity for the recent Permian transaction. Is there any thoughts about buying back to offset that dilution? And my second question, just in terms of exploration for 2017. I know the focus is on Guyana, but could you talk about any other high impact place for 2017 and the spend associated? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So Theepan, on the fundamental question of, to me, I interpret it as whether we would buy back any stock and I will go back to our earlier discussion around it. It's really a quarterly decision that management makes based on a number of variables that I have already described. And as I said in the prepared comments, we don't anticipate doing any type of buybacks, other than into to address anti-dilutive impacts associated with the benefits programs and plans. On other exploration focus, we expect for the near term, flat spend out to out through the next several years, but I have shared a number of key areas that we are focusing our attention. Cypress, the high quality block we have got there on Block 10 that we have entered in negotiations on the production sharing contract, but we are very encouraged by it. Mexico, the Block 1 that we picked up, which is right along the U.S. border adjacent to some U.S. acreage that we have got. Again, very encouraged by it, putting plans in place. I indicated that we continue to expand to our exploration acreage position in Papa New Guinea. You think about some of the big high potential areas for us, Papa New Guinea is very important to us. Guyana, that area has been very important to us. And then as we have been talking about often on today is the unconventional business with a very strong focus on the liquids potential. So I think it really does make a very strong statement around the value proposition that we are trying to deliver to our shareholders. Theepan Jothilingam : Okay. Thanks Jeff. I was just wondering, when you think about potential acquisition add between equity and adding debt, could you talk about how the market should think about that? Should we see if there are opportunities Exxon uses paper rather than debt? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, it's going to be case specific. I mean the important message for you to understand is that we have the flexibility to do either. The final structure of a given transaction is really a function of the dialog between the parties with the focus of what the seller wants from the transaction. But I wouldn't read anymore into it relating to our capital structure. Theepan Jothilingam : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question guys. Just two quick ones. You mentioned that almost all of the increase towards the $22 billion CapEx budget reflects higher activity. Can you be a little more specific on what service cost inflation you are assuming, particularly in your North American CapEx? Jeff Woodbury : Pavel, as I indicated earlier, we are going to provide more color around our investment plans in about a month's time in the Analyst Meeting. I would just ask you to hold out until we get to that point. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. And as far as the InterOil closing process, you are currently doing the rerun of the shareholder vote. Should the Yukon court bock the second attempt, as they blocked the first one, is there any other alternative in your mind to getting shareholder approval? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, well, I mean let me not speculate as to how this will progress. Very strong support from the shareholders of InterOil. This is a process that InterOil is running and we think that we have addressed some of the comments that were made in the first process. So let's let that go through and then we will decide how we move forward from there. Pavel Molchanov : All right. I appreciate it. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Jeff Woodbury : Well, I want to thank everybody for their participation today and I really do appreciate your time and the questions. We appreciate your continues interest in ExxonMobil and we really do look forward to visiting with you next month at the Analyst Meeting. So until then, we will keep very focused on our fundamental mission of growing long-term shareholder value. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings call. The comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. So before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2. Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our first quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $4 billion in the quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $8.9 billion, more than covering both dividends and net investments in the business for the second consecutive quarter. We achieved solid results from each of our business segments and remain steadfast on managing costs and operating efficiently. In the first quarter, we continued advancing strategic opportunities to grow value through disciplined investment, portfolio acquisitions and high-impact exploration. Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. The global economy started the year with modest growth. In the United States, expansion slowed in the first quarter. However, growth rates were stable in China and Europe and appear to have slightly improved in Japan. The commodity price environment improved in the quarter, as both crude oil and natural gas prices strengthened. As a result, the global rig count increased, driven primarily by higher activity in the U.S. Refining margins also improved, with global demand growth, heavier industry downtime and seasonal product inventory draw. Further, global chemical commodity margins increased on higher realizations, with industry polyethylene capacity utilization remaining strong in advance of U.S. Gulf Coast expansions. Turning now to the financial results as shown on slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil first quarter earnings were $4 billion or $0.95 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.1 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $4.2 billion, down nearly 19% from the prior year quarter, as the corporation continues disciplined execution of its investment plans. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.9 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4.9 million. A debt was $43.6 billion net debt, which is debt less cash, declined in the quarter. Debt was impacted by the funding of the escrow account for the contingent resource payment associated with the InterOil acquisition. These funds, which totaled $1.7 billion, were loaned back to the company for the escrow account. Now, this impact is temporary, as ExxonMobil acquired a receivable as part of the InterOil deal, which is expected to more than cover the contingent resource payment. The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, cash balances increased from $3.7 billion to $4.9 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $8.9 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.1 billion and net investments in the business of $4.5 billion, which included the $1.7 billion to fund the escrow account I previously mentioned. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by $100 million, which included the impact of anti-dilutive share purchases. Cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered dividends and net investments with an excess of $1.3 billion. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.77 per share, representing a 2.7% increase from last quarter and marking our 35th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. In the quarter, ExxonMobil continued to limit share repurchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the second quarter. Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's first quarter earnings increased $2.2 billion from the year ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream results. Further gains in the Downstream were offset by lower Chemical results and higher Corporate and Financing expenses. In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 8, absent the fourth quarter 2016 Upstream impairment charge, earnings increased over $300 million due to strong results from the Upstream and Chemical businesses. This was partly offset by higher Corporate costs driven by the absence of last quarter's favorable one-time non-U.S. tax items. On average, we expect Corporate and Financing expenses will continue to be between $400 million and $600 million per quarter in the near-term. I'll note our corporate effective tax rate was 38% during the quarter, up from 19% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time items. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 9. First quarter Upstream earnings were $2.3 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from the prior quarter due to higher realizations. Crude prices increased more than $19 a barrel versus the year ago quarter and gas realizations increased nearly $1 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $150 million, largely because of lower entitlements and higher maintenance. All other items increased earnings $170 million, driven by lower operating costs. Upstream unit profitability for the first quarter was $6.19 per barrel, excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. So moving now to slide 10, oil equipment production in the quarter was 4.2 million barrels per day, a decrease of 4% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Liquids production was down 205,000 barrels per day, the result of lower entitlements and increased maintenance. New project volumes more than offset field decline. Natural gas production increased to 184 million cubic feet per day, as volumes from new projects and higher demand more than offset field decline and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands. Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11. Upstream earnings were $867 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2016, when the effect of last quarter's impairment charge is excluded. Our realizations contributed $570 million of earnings. Crude prices increased nearly $3 per barrel and gas realizations increased nearly $0.50 per thousand cubic feet. All other items added $300 million, again, largely the result of lower operating expenses. Moving to slide 12, sequentially, volumes increased about 1% or 30,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production decreased about 50,000 barrels per day because of lower entitlements, whereas new project volumes offset higher downtime. Natural gas production increased 484 million cubic feet per day, due to ramp-up of recent project startups, increased demand and lower downtime. Moving now to the Downstream financial operating results starting on slide 13. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up $210 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $160 million, mainly from increased operational efficiency which resulted in higher throughput. All other items added $40 million, mostly from minor asset management activities, partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Turning to slide 14. Downstream earnings decreased sequentially by $125 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $220 million, primarily driven by higher planned maintenance. All other items reduced earnings by a further $110 million, driven by higher turnaround costs and the absence of fourth quarter asset management gains of more than $500 million from the Imperial Oil's retail network sale. Now this was partially offset by lower operating costs and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory impacts. Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15. First quarter Chemical earnings were $1.2 billion, down $184 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker margins, primarily from specialty products, decreased earnings by $70 million. All other items decreased earnings by $110 million, largely due to increased turnaround expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Moving to slide 16. Chemical earnings improved sequentially about $300 million. Stronger commodity margins increased earnings by $170 million, as higher realizations outpaced rising feed and energy costs. All other items increased earnings $140 million, primarily reflecting lower expenses and the absence of unfavorable fourth quarter inventory effects. Turning to slide 17 and our business highlights. First, a strategic acquisition in Mozambique. ExxonMobil signed an agreement to acquire a 25% indirect interest in Area 4, offshore Mozambique, for cash consideration of $2.8 billion. The deepwater Area 4 block is estimated to contain more than 85 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in place, with high expected well deliverability, underpinning a world-class LNG project. We believe the project will be well positioned to supply LNG customers in markets around the world. ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operations of the planned onshore facilities, including liquefaction trains with capacity of up to 40 million tons per annum. As such, ExxonMobil will contribute its expertise in project execution and operations to support the project's success in a globally competitive LNG market. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. After it has closed, the partners will optimize development plans and determine key milestones such as FID and startup timing accordingly. Now elsewhere in Mozambique, we are evaluating three high-potential blocks for which we were awarded the right to negotiate exploration and production rights. We participated in a multi-client 3-D seismic survey which was completed in November of last year. We look forward to finalizing discussions with the government of Mozambique on PSEs for these blocks. Turning now to slide 18 for an update on our project and exploration activity. To begin with, ExxonMobil closed two significant acquisitions this quarter. The first was the InterOil deal with assets in Papua New Guinea. We are now engaging with co-venturers to assess optimal development of discovered, undeveloped resources, both legacy and acquired. The Antelope-7 appraisal well is complete and the interim resource recertification process has been initiated and will be completed later this year. The second transaction was our acquisition of companies owned by the Bass family, which more than doubled our Permian Basin resources. An integrated asset team is in place to manage these newly acquired properties. In order to fully capitalize on the advantages offered by the highly contiguous acreage position and our participation across the full value chain, the team is leveraging corporate expertise in unconventional development, research, project management and logistics. We do expect to spud the first well on the new acreage shortly. Next, we continue to selectively invest in projects across the value chain. We currently have 18 major projects in execution across all business segments. In the Upstream, this includes projects such as Hebron and Odoptu Stage 2. Commissioning work's progressing well on both of these projects, which are expected to start up before year-end, adding a combined gross production capacity of 215,000 barrels of oil per day. In the Downstream, the Antwerp coker project will start up later this year, delivering higher value products including ultra-low sulfur diesel, and the chemical expansion project at Baytown and Mont Belvieu will begin a phased startup in the second half of the year. In other recent developments, in Australia, Train Three at Gorgon-Jansz started up in March. All three trains are now available to ramp up to full plant capacity of 15.6 million tons per annum. Turning to exploration, we remain focused on adding resources that are attractive in the current price environment. We recently announced the Snoek discovery in Guyana with reservoirs similar in age to the prior discoveries at Liza and Payara. The rig has moved to the Liza-4 appraisal well, which is evaluating the east flank of the Liza field. A well test is expected to begin on this well next month. After Lisa-4, the rig will drill a delineation well at Payara and we'll also test a deeper exploration prospect. We also continue to capture new high potential acreage around the world. In the U.S., ExxonMobil is the current high bidder on 19 blocks in the central Gulf of Mexico. In Papua New Guinea, a recent farm-in to two offshore blocks was ratified by the government. These blocks are just 60 miles south of our LNG facilities. The initial scope of work is expected to include seismic acquisition. And finally, in Cyprus, we were awarded an exploration and production-sharing contract for offshore Block 10 with our long-standing partner, Qatar Petroleum. The contract includes commitments to acquire 3-D seismic data and drill two exploration wells, with the first well anticipated in 2018. I'll note this block is near the recent Zora discovery. Moving now to the final slide, the corporation remains committed to growing value across our integrated businesses. All three of our business segments contributed to solid performance in the quarter, together earning $4 billion while remaining highly focused on business fundamentals. Upstream production volumes were consistent with plans at 4.2 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Total CapEx was $4.2 billion, a decrease of 19% from the prior quarter. The corporation has remained disciplined in its investment program, selectively advancing strategic opportunities across the value chain while maintaining focus on capital efficiencies. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $8.9 billion and free cash flow was $4.9 billion, more than covering $3.1 billion in quarterly shareholder dividends even after funding the escrow account for the InterOil transaction. We remain committed to our shareholders as demonstrated by our reliable and growing dividend. Regardless of the business cycle, we are confident in ExxonMobil's integrated business model and our ability to create shareholder value over the long term. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be very happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we will take our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Morning, Jeff. How are you? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Brad. I'm doing well. How are you? Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good, good. Thanks. So a couple of questions on LNG. Obviously that and Mozambique now \u2013 that goes into a really long LNG queue, so you've got P&G, Golden Pass, Scarborough, the list sort of goes on and on. I'm curious how you think about the order of priority there? And just generally, how much room you think there is for more LNG in the portfolio? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, good question, Brad. I think I'd start first with the second question, and really think about our energy outlook and our long-term view on demand, and particularly as it relates to LNG. So to start off, as you know, we have gas growing from 2015 to 2014 at about 1.5% per year, in fact becoming the second highest source of supply overtaking coal for the obvious environmental benefits. On an LNG basis, over that same time period, out to 2040, we have LNG capacity and thus demand growing by about 250%. So there is the business case right there. Now obviously like any type of supply/demand mechanics, you're going to see periods of tightness, periods where there's excess demand and requires a supply response. So as you highlighted, Brad, moving into your second \u2013 your first question, there are a number of LNG projects that we are concurrently progressing. I will tell you that not all of them will move at the same pace. We've got a good diverse portfolio, some that are associated with Brownfield expansions to existing facilities, such as the Papua New Guinea or the Golden Pass. And then others more large greenfield developments like Mozambique. Each of them have unique characteristics that we're going to try to place them in the market, but it's not choosing one or the other at this point. It's a matter of moving them all forward, and depending on all the different variables that have to work for a multi-billion dollar investment, some will come to maturity quicker. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess digging in slightly on Mozambique, I was curious if you foresee any changes to the development plan as it's been laid out in the past, I'm specifically thinking about coral and how you feel about the floating LNG plan there. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Brad, I would tell you that obviously we've got to wait for the regulatory approvals to be concluded and then get with the co-venturers and have discussions. But the current plan is that coral will progress. Brad Heffern - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we will now hear from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Jeff, always appreciate your perspective on the oil macro. Brent's really still trying to get some legs under it here in 2017. Where does Exxon believe we are in terms of the crude rebalancing process? We appreciate your views on OPEC/non-OPEC in demand. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. That's a good question. Clearly, I would say that the macro would still indicate, from an ExxonMobil perspective, still indicate the need to be cautious going forward. As we've talked in the past, underlying demand growth has been generally strong. We're seeing demand growth of about 1.4 million barrels a day, similar to last year. And that's above the 10-year average. As we would've expected, we're seeing a supply-side response to supply and demand coming into balance, and we do see that non-OPEC volumes are growing particularly driven by North America, and specifically the unconventionals. And you think over the last recent period, unconventionals have grown to, round numbers, about 800,000 barrels a day on trend to maybe 1 million barrels a day over a 12-month period. So I think it all indicates the importance of making sure that we are very thoughtful about the near- and longer-term macro environment. On an OPEC basis, as you've seen, OPEC has generally met their commitments. A little bit short, but they are demonstrating a level of compliance. But when you step back and look at the supply side, I think is the biggest issue in front of us, and that would be a function of so many elements, including the North American response I talked about, but also economic growth and other variables. Remember, we still have round numbers about 600 million barrels in storage, and depending on what near-term prices do, that's going to come out at some point. So a lot of variables to think about, and that's what really underpins my comment about just being cautious. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate that, Jeff. And the follow-up is that, just want to talk about your long-term growth aspirations in two regions that don't always get a ton of attention. And the first would be Iraq and the second would be Russia. Any comments on either of those, it would be helpful. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, let me start with Russia. I mean, as everybody clearly knows that the sanctions remain in place, and that I want be very clear that we remain in full compliance with those sanctions. And therefore, not a whole lot is being done there other than our assets on the East Coast that are not included within the sanction restrictions. And I'll tell you, that development has continued to perform exceptionally well. I mentioned in the prepared comments that we've got the next phase of development there with the Odoptu Stage 2 starting up by the end of the year and it's moved remarkably well and we've got a very, very strong co-venturer there that supports our activities. In terms of Iraq, we are running generally consistent in terms of our production activities. I mean, the key for Iraq will be ongoing investment to build up capacity for water injection, to maintain reservoir pressure in these big very large oil fields. We'll continue to invest to build that capacity commensurate with the availability of the required infrastructure and we'll just need to see how that plays out over time. We're actively involved with other co-venturers and the government to address the future requirements. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You bet. Operator : And our next participant is Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Morning, Phil. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, first question just on the capital spending, obviously, was trending well below the full-year expectation in the first quarter. Maybe you could just give us a little bit of color about how you might expect that to progress for the year. Are there going to be significant ramps as we progress through the year? And I guess, specifically, I see that the U.S. number on E&P was actually down quarter-over-quarter and I know from the Analyst Day, ramping shales is a big focus; so maybe any color you can give on rig count today and where you hope to be, perhaps, by year-end. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Will do. Let me first talk about our CapEx. I mean there really is no change right now, Phil, to our CapEx guidance. I will continue to emphasize that the organization has done a remarkable job in identifying and capturing capital efficiencies. I mean, I think that is a huge opportunity for value growth in the future. I think you saw that, if you recall, our actual spend last year was down materially versus our guidance and that was, in part, due to the organization's focus on this important area. So $22 billion is still our guidance. If you remember in the analyst presentation, we gave a breakdown on how we plan to spend that and what key areas that we're planning to focus on. You mentioned the short cycle program which, I'll just remind, is not only unconventional, but also a very significant component of a conventional work program. But if you look at our total rigs in the U.S. unconventional, they have gone from 13 in the fourth quarter and we're now up to 18 rigs. So we are starting to ramp that activity. As I said in the prepared comments, in the Delaware acreage that we recently picked up, we've got a very concerted focus to this effort and we should have a rig on site here soon and we'll continue to ramp up activity in that property. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And where might you hope to be in rig counts by year-end in order to achieve some of your production goals for the next one to two years? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, Phil, I don't really have a number to share with you on that, but I will tell you that as we signaled previously, our intent was to pick up in the order of magnitude, order, range of about 15 rigs in that Delaware acreage over time. Whether that happens by the end of the year or that happens later into the following year, I really can't go ahead and give you a more exact number. But it will be a function of a number of factors. Remember we are looking at this from a value chain perspective and we're working on all the elements to make sure that we can, when we make the investment, that we can get that product all the way to the consumer. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure, okay. And just my follow-up would be on the chemicals project. You mentioned the phased ramp as the year progresses. I guess what I'm wondering is maybe a little bit more color around when you might expect a full actual contribution from the cracker? Would you be thinking by early 2018, you might be up at a full run rate? Or might it take a bit longer than that? Just any additional clarity. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Let me say, first of all, just to remind everybody that it's another 1.5 million tons per annum of capability and then corresponding derivative units to provide high-quality calcium polyethylene products. The construction has been going extremely well. We expect that we'd be starting up the full facility by the end of the year into the next part of the year, so there will be some time to ramp up thereafter. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, Jeff and team. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : I have a couple of questions on pay-for-performance per your new documents. First, when you consider that ExxonMobil's performance peers only posted a TSR of about a third or so of S&P 500 during the past decade, it seems like the bar could be higher for comparative purposes and that shareholders may be better served if it were. And while you outperformed most of these companies, Jeff, my question is how does the company think about the need to stretch the objective in this particular area as some of the peers have done? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I think we have a very unique executive compensation program, Doug, as we've talked in the past, with a large part of the compensation really at risk based on the corporation's performance, particularly on its stock performance. Just to remind everybody that our long-term performance is based on a 5-, and a 10-year vesting, and the 10-year is really the latter of 10 years or retirement. So therefore, some can go even beyond 10 years. So it really does incentivize management to focus on our fundamental mission as a corporation and that is to grow shareholder value. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : That's right. And so let's stay on that for a second because it is the season on pay-for-performance, and during the past nine years, Rex was awarded I think around 225,000 shares every year, even though there was pretty insignificant variability in industry conditions, company performance, et cetera. So my question on that, Jeff, is what is it in the compensation system that drives this apparent mismatch between low variability and the pay factor, or one of them that is, and high variability in the industry and company outcomes? Meaning is it as simple as following a heavy weighting on the part that aligns CEO pay with the compensation and performance peers which is, I think, considered good corporate governance? Is it investment lead times? Or is it something else? Or either way, how do you expect this correlation between these variables to change in the future, if you think that it will? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, Doug, I mean I think I would just focus on ExxonMobil and the structure that we've put in place and how it has really proven over time. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Right. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: If you look at the way the Compensation Committee considers this, there are seven key areas that we're thinking about and they really focus on all of those areas in terms of deciding whether we have achieved first quartile performance. And they're thinking about it over the investment lead times, so we're not looking at the given year, we're looking at it over a period of time, and particularly focused on the return on capital employed and our safety performance. And that is what sets and determines whether the corporation is, or that the most senior executives have achieved first quartile performance, which then sets the award amounts. And we think that that is working extremely well and it really does very much align the executives with that of the performance of shareholders. I mean, a very clear correlation that we have got to focus on that shareholder return as job number one. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And you guys did a good job of laying it out this year in my opinion. So thanks for that, Jeff, and thanks again. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You bet. Thank you. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Operator : We will now hear from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff, good morning, everybody. Jeff, I wonder if I could go back to the CapEx question. The $22 billion guidance for this year, does that include the acquisition in Mozambique? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, it does. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So your actual CapEx, your organic CapEx then is obviously closer to $18.5 billion, $19 billion then. Is that right? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Well, it'd be the $22 billion minus the $2.8 billion. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, okay. Yes, I can do the math. Thanks so much for that. Well, I guess just a related question, then. Is 25% of Block 4 enough to do things the Exxon way? Meaning, you typically bring in Qatargas as a partner, Golden Pass, I guess being the most recent case in point, and I guess you know where I'm going with this. Do you think Block 1 is necessary for you to move forward? Or can you move forward with Block 4 as it stands? And I've got a follow-up, please. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Well listen, I mean, Doug, I mean I understand the point of the question. Clearly, we did the deal with the expectation that we're going to move forward with co-venturers on Area 4, and we think it's an accretive opportunity to our overall value proposition given the diversity of our existing portfolio. As I mentioned, Doug, we also have what we consider as high-potential exploration acreage that we're going to continue to progress. So, I mean standalone, as it is right now, the acquisition was premised on a very successful and competitive LNG development on Area 4. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for that. My follow-up is on Guyana, Jeff. If I heard you correct, you said you're planning a well test on Liza-4. I'm assuming that means Lisa-4 was spud 31st of March, if I understand correctly. Does that mean Lisa-4, you're declaring that a success this morning? And if so, can you give us an update on next steps as it relates to FID, first oil because I think the license you applied for is second half of 2019 versus 2020? And just any color you can give on next steps would be great. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. So the Liza-4 is still drilling, to be clear. Following the completion of that well, we would then go ahead and move into a test, and as I said, the rig would then move over to Payara for the delineation well that will allow us to not only do the delineation in Payara, but also this deep exploration prospect. The well itself will be integrated; the results of the Liza-4 well will be integrated into our development planning activities that ultimately will inform a FID decision on the initial phase at Guyana. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, no update on timing on FID? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I'm sorry. Say again, Doug? Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No updating on timing of a final investment decision? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Midyear. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Midyear. Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Morning, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So normalizing your CapEx for the full year run rate and taking out asset sales, you spent in line with distributed cash in the first quarter \u2013 you spent in line with cash, sorry, in the first quarter. Went for an average $54. Crude is lower. Clearly, investment sentiment is lower. You mentioned a cautious near-term crude outlook, but can you discuss the factors that the board considered when raising the dividend? Whether that's the balance sheet or the short cycle element or future margins? Just kind of give us some color to delays against an increasingly gloomier outlook? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I think the first thing I would say, Evan, is that it really does reflect the confidence that the board and senior management has in the efficiency of the integrated business model, recognizing that we're going to see peaks and valleys in a commodity-priced business and that we have built the business to be durable in a low-price environment. So, I mean it really talks to the business model at the start. The second point I would make is that we have thoroughly communicated through the years that a reliable and growing dividend is clearly the priority. Now putting that aside as, if you will, the backdrop to the decision, then it's looking forward and looking at the investment plans that we have and understanding how we're going to continue to grow value within the corporation. So I think it's all those factors. And remember, when we're thinking about our investment planning, Evan, we're thinking about it consistent with a long-term view, a constructive view on supply and demand. So it's about making sure that we're comfortable that we're going to continue to generate, from our perspective, industry-leading returns and continue to grow value. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That makes sense. And my second question is on Guyana. I know Technip earlier this week announced that it won some Liza Phase I contract for trees, which was subsea trees, which was for 17 trees. I guess that's more than we would have expected given flow rate of wells and high reservoir quality. Does that higher number indicate any kind of potential upsizing for Phase I FPSO beyond 120,000 barrels a day? Just any color on that, if you could. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, Evan. I'd say it's probably a little bit too premature to talk about. I mean we are on, as you can appreciate, if we're getting close to an FID by the middle of this year, we're getting pretty close to fully defining the scope of the development, and there's still more work to be done, and we'll obviously share more of the specifics when we get to an FID decision. But right now, I really don't want to get into the specifics of the analysis that is actually underway. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thought I'd give it a try. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: All right. Operator : And we will now hear from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Jeff. Jeff, could we go back to Mozambique if we could? I've obviously heard what you've been saying about it, but could you just clarify the development? I think Eni had talked about floating LNG. I assume, obviously, that you're leading an onshore effort means that presumably that's the direction that you're going to want to head in. Could you firstly just remind us why you bought into this reserve? Secondly, how you plan to develop it? Especially as we're aware that you're not involved in the existing project onshore? Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, well, the why is really because that we see it as a very competitive low cost to supply LNG source in the market. You think about some of the big greenfield developments that we've done historically and that we've participated in upfront in the development of Qatar and we're very proud of the role that we played in helping the state of Qatar to meet their overall objectives and has evolved into the world's leader in LNG. Papua New Guinea, another big greenfield development that has been extremely successful and is a key competitive source of LNG in the market and we see the same type of characteristics in Mozambique. And so that's why we see it as a very competitive LNG source. In terms of what the plans are, remember that there was a floating LNG concept that was being progressed by the current co-venturers. It's called the Coral floating LNG, that is still intended to move forward. And then the most significant part of the Mozambique development would be an onshore development. As I said in my prepared comments, with anticipated capacity up to 40 million tons per annum for Area 4. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Is that going to be your own standalone development then, led by Exxon? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I'm sorry? The large... Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : The onshore. Yes, the 40 million tons. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Let's be clear what's going on. So the actual ownership is by a Eni affiliate that we bought into. So the operator is Eni East Africa. The leadership will be provided by ExxonMobil on the onshore LNG facilities and Eni on the onshore facilities. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Forgive me. I looked at the financial annual that you put out recently in the Mozambique section. I can't see. Do you have an onshore position, land or site? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It's being worked with the government concurrently. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So that's not yet the case, but it's underway. Understood. And what's the best guess, Jeff, for when this thing might actually be final investment decision and producing gas? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. I really have nothing to share with you at this point. I think what's important right now Paul is that we get the regulatory approvals and then working with the co-venturers to really optimize the development and we'll have a better handle on that once we get past those milestones. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You bet. Operator : And our next question comes from Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Yeah, good morning. I think it's going to be a LNG focus this morning given that Mozambique slide. Is there any change in LNG pricing approach, or I guess contracting approach? Obviously, Europe has got a big spot market that cargoes can be put into. Are you still thinking of the conventional way where you basically sign up Heads of Agreement and then contracts with long-term off-takers before launching an FID? The reason I ask is that there is a number of competing LNG schemes which will try and hit that 2023-2024 mismatch between supply and demand for LNG. So just trying to see how flexible you'll be to make sure these projects get in that first window. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, Ed. It's a really good question. I mean, first point I'd make is given our success in Qatar and Papua New Guinea, I mean, we have built a tremendous amount of market credibility with the customers. We have an operational center that we set up in Singapore in order to provide the customers all the support they need. So I think the first message there is one of being able to go out and interface with the customers, meet their needs, but fundamentally, our objective will be to enter into long-term contracts that will underpin the investment. And the commercial structure of that continues to evolve. But I would tell you the commercial structure will be such that it will certainly underpin the substantial investments required for these LNG projects. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Okay. And then on Guyana, more about timing. I mean, obviously you have your rig and it's going to be exciting to see how big Liza and then Payara could be with these appraisals. At the Analyst Day, you did walk through a number of other prospects that were being matured. I'm just wondering how many of those do you think would be drill-ready for when the rig is freed up in a few months on Payara, say, through the end of 2018? Wild guess. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. I mean, I'll tell you, Ed, this is job number one for our folks in exploration is making sure that they are staying well ahead of the rig, maturing the prospects to get them to a drillable stage. I'll just remind you that it's not only the Stabroek Block, but it's also Canje and Kaieteur that we're real-time integrating the 3-D seismic. We're taking the well results that we've got from the Stabroek Block program to date and we're real-time assessing the highest potential and they're staying, by definition, they're staying well ahead of the rig line. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Good luck with the drilling time of one month. That's going to be some fast work. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I'd tell you, I will say give some credit to the drillers and the wellsite team and the contractor. I mean, we have had just remarkable results on the program in Guyana. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : And we will now hear from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Jeff, good morning. I had two questions for you, maybe I can just ask both. The first is on Oil Sands. Many of your peers have been minimizing their footprint and I was just curious if you could comment on your appetite to maintain your existing position there. And then the second, forgive me it's a little bit detailed, but on the buybacks, I see that you were just purchasing or repurchasing to offset dilution, but that number in the quarter struck me as fairly large, $500 million, where I think last year, you did just under $1 billion for the full year. So is there anything from a timing standpoint or one-off that kind of inflated that dilution in 1Q where we should think that to kind of normalize going forward? Thanks so much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, so on the Oil Sands, let me just step back a little bit and just remind everybody that we've been working on Oil Sands for over three decades now, and with that, we've maintained a very focused technology program. And I'd start off on the mining side with Kearl which was unique in its own right because of, we were able, through technology application, avoid the investment and the environmental footprint associated with an upgrader. And as we said during the analyst presentation, we have continued to work on the cost side and have substantially reduced the overall cost in that operation. So remember, long-lived assets, a long source of cash flow for us, and like we have always done with all of our assets, we will continue to be working towards enhancing the value of it. On the oil sand side, our long history in Cold Lake, and then, looking at how we step the technology out further to not only enhance recovery but also lower cost and lower the environmental footprint. And we're looking at some new technology on SA-SAGD that we think will take us to that next step, but as you may recall, Blake, we've got a very large oil sands portfolio. And we like what we've got and we'll continue to look for ways to make it even more valuable in the future. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Okay. And the buybacks, the dilution? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I'd tell you the buyback \u2013 I mean clearly, it varies over time. If you look over our history, there's variability with respect to that dilution, and it's fairly in line over a reasonable length of time. There's really nothing more I can share about it. I mean it's clearly defined as our intent to avoid dilution on our shareholders. Blake Fernandez - Howard Weil : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Maybe to follow up a little bit on Blake's question there on the share repos and guidance, not to do any more than offset dilution in Q2, you did outperform on cash flow in the quarter, especially with the lower CapEx. What should we be looking for or what do you think execs on the board are looking for in terms of the confidence? Is it oil prices, is it mostly just Exxon internally focused, a combo of the two? I'm just curious what would bring you back to that conference to buy back shares. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I mean, despite the macro volatility, which frankly, we have lived within for over 130 years, we're going to ensure that the business model is durable regardless. But it's then looking back about the value growth proposition that we've been able to put in place and how that has ultimately added back into further financial capability than what we currently have. It's the same variables that we've discussed previously about how we decide whether to move forward with a buyback or not, and that decision is made on a quarterly basis. We'll consider things like the company's current financial position, our near-term CapEx requirements, our dividend requirements as well as the near-term business outlook. It's part of our capital allocation, Roger. The decision at this point will be one of deciding to put the cash to work either through buyback or reducing our debt load. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then, you mentioned earlier the idea of a 15 rig target in the Delaware Basin, a spread between when we could expect that. What do you see as the main kind of levers that we should be watching to get pulled or need to see in the market to reach that target sooner or later? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, again, we'll be thinking about it from a long-term. We made a substantial acquisition, and that acquisition had assumed a certain amount of activity. And if we have true confidence in one, our business model, and two, our energy outlook, we'll go ahead and deliver on that activity level and ramp up. We see unique value that we're going to bring to that Permian acreage. And as we said back when we consummated the transaction, we believe that we're going to demonstrate that we are going to be industry-leading in terms of overall unit development cost and overall return on investment given the unique aspects of it and that being, as I said previously, the contiguous nature of it and the ability for us to bring our value chain perspective. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Sorry. Just if I could follow up real quick on that, the decision to expand the Downstream along the Gulf Coast, obviously, was tied into that, but is there a \u2013 in terms of the timing of developing the Delaware Basin, is some of the focus on supplying your Downstream? Or is that two separate items, two separate decisions? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: But I'd say on a macro level, it's one and the same. We're thinking about we participate across the full value chain. When you get into the specifics, I wouldn't necessarily say that they were connected. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Operator : And our next participant is Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Jeff, I just wanted to ask about how you see the role of the exploration program for the corporation currently. Many of your peers have really cut back activity levels and even your own spending has essentially fallen in half, at least in 2016 relative to where it had been in previous years, but you're also talking about fairly significant restocking of the portfolio that had some pretty clear success in Guyana. Is this an area where you see Exxon perhaps being able to distinguish itself from peers in the near-term? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. I mean the short answer is yes. I mean I would tell you that, as I said previously, a key aspect of the exploration program is to target resource opportunities that will upgrade \u2013 from a value perspective, upgrade our existing portfolio. I mean that is exactly what we're doing. We want the exploration folks to know that whatever they discover, the objective is that that gets to the top of our portfolio and brings unique value to the corporation. Yes, we did slow down some of the exploration activities, but I'd say that we maintained a very healthy program in the down cycle. Last year, we shot the largest seismic acquisition program that we've done historically at a lower cost because of the market conditions. I think it was over 60,000 square kilometers of seismic in 2016. A very successful outcome. And then, you think about the Guyana discovery, or discoveries, and the acreage capture that we've been able to pick up here in some really high potential unique opportunities. I think it really talks to how our exploration company and the organization how it has really contributed to not only the current but the future success of the corporation. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Appreciate that, Jeff. If I could just follow up a lot of what you're doing in exploration and indeed what you've added in Mozambique, is targeting deepwater areas. Is this a function of Exxon believing that deepwater can still be competitive if you have the right resource? Or is this really just a function of the opportunities that were available to you at the time? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, let me start, first, that our program is primarily focused in two key areas. The first one is high potential unexplored areas that, as I said a moment ago, that really compete with high grading the portfolio, like Guyana. And the second area is where we see material potential near existing infrastructure, like the Gulf of Mexico, like Canada East where we've picked up a lot of acreage by our Hebron and Hibernia facilities. So that is really what sets up the framework of our exploration program. And I would say that, as it relates to deepwater, that we do believe that given the right quality resource and given the progress that we have made on reducing the costs associated with our development programs, that we do see deepwater as being competitive. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: That's very helpful. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Operator : And we will now hear from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Jeff, two quick questions. First, the asset sale proceeds is about $700 million for the quarter. So can you share with us what's the asset sales gain and how that's split between different divisions? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. So as you said, it's just under $700 million in gross proceeds, and the earnings impact in the quarter was about $230 million, about half of it in Upstream and half in the Downstream. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And secondly then, you recently joined force with the Saudi on the Chemical to build a new Chemical site I think in Corpus Christi. In the U.S., given that you have such a commanding and well-established operation in Chemical, just curious that what's the rationale behind that you don't go ahead on your own and then you start using a joint venture structure given that it's always a little bit more challenging that when you're trying to manage a joint venture over time, so what exactly you expect that is going to bring to you that you decide not to go ahead and just do it on your own? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, I think it's a good question, Paul, and each one of these transactions are unique in their own right. We have a very long, well-established and successful partnership with SABIC, and this is something that in our broader business dealings both parties wanted to do and we saw that this was a good opportunity and a good means to achieving that. So as you know, the current expansion on ethylene capacity and corresponding polyethylene at Baytown and Mont Belvieu is 100% ExxonMobil, and as part of our long strategic relationship with SABIC, we decided to enter into a joint venture with them to pursue this possible steam cracker in the Gulf Coast. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Should we read that into that or maybe there's just too much that in the future expansion in the U.S., that would be the path that you take or that this is really just one-off? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I mean it will be dependent on the circumstances. I mean this one, as I said, there were strategic reasons for doing it. It made good sense. We had a very good long-established relationship in Saudi Arabia with SABIC, and we think this is the right thing to do. But I wouldn't read anything specific into it. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jeff. Maybe just a couple follow-ups. One on Liza. As you get ready for FID, any high level thoughts you can share on drivers for the cost structure for the field, both specific drivers that are specific to Liza in terms of driving down a lower cost structure and then, maybe what you're seeing on a broader, specific things from the broader cost structure in terms of developing these types of projects, in terms of cost deflation, in terms of how we can think about potential costs of the project? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. I mean it's a good question when you think about the full scope of our development in Guyana, and clearly, the higher the resource density, the more profitable it's going to be, so I mean it starts with the resource, and then it goes to the focus on the design. And we really would like to get very much in the mode of designing one and building many, like we did in Angola, get in a routine of really working in optimal design, and then replicating that as you continue to expand resources through your exploration program. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And any thoughts in terms of the, I mean as you're close here, the cost deflation that you've seen across those types of product lines in terms of relative to where we were a few years ago? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I mean that's a specific focus area for us, and if you look back at our analyst presentation, if you look at a pool of projects that we've been working on, and from a development planning perspective and take us to current day on those projects, we've seen about a 30% cost reduction and that's through a lot of the development planning, the design work, the scope reduction or scope optimization that we've been doing. So a very substantial reduction over the last several years in terms of what we anticipate these assets are going to cost. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up. You've been active so far in asset acquisitions on everything ranging from international gas to domestic onshore oil. Any thoughts on where you're seeing greater value these days, international conventional style assets versus U.S. onshore and whether you continue to see a high level of interesting opportunities globally? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Ryan, I don't think I would focus on any one asset type or geography. As I have said previously, we will keep alert to opportunities around the globe, whether it be in the Upstream or the Downstream or Chemical business. And we'll evaluate those specific opportunities on their own merits. And remember, our objective here is, once again, to acquire assets that will compete with our existing portfolio and we're looking for opportunities that we can see accretive value to. So I mean that's how I would characterize it, but we've had a number of transactions, as you're aware of, and we keep our eyes open and I think that's another indication of the strength of the corporation, that we've got the financial flexibility to pursue those opportunities when they come up. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Welcome. Operator : And we will now hear from Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas : Yeah, hi. Morning, Jeff. Just a couple of follow-up questions actually. Firstly, just a comment on sort of your investment plans. I think you talked about 2017, including Mozambique. I was just wondering when you look at the guidance from the Analyst Day for 2018 to 2020, and the $70 billion to $80 billion there, I was just wondering how much in there is sort of assumed inorganic spend? And then the second question, I think characteristic of these results, the Q1 has been sort of the lower operating expense from Exxon across multiple businesses. I was just wondering how much more do you think there is to go from an internal perspective through 2017, 2018. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Well, Theepan, I guess the first point I'd make on the investment program is that if it was not already in progress, there's really nothing in the forward investment plan. It goes back to my last comment that we've got that financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions if we think they are value accretive. So there's nothing really I can highlight for you on the forward 2018 to 2020 investment program that we shared in the analyst presentation. Looking at our cost structure, the first thing I would say is that I'm always very much amazed with the success the organization is able to achieve with finding more innovative solutions. And I want to be really clear. This is not just squeezing the margins on the service sector. This is working with the service sector to find lower cost innovative alternatives to allow for this work to get done. And I think that relationship, that collaboration has been a key to success that we've been able to achieve. I will tell you that, from our perspective, we believe we're never done on driving that cost structure. We continue, as I said, the organization continues to identify new opportunities to lower that cost structure while maintaining and enhancing operational integrity. So I'm not going to put a specific target out there, but the role of the organization is one to really identify and capture the lowest lifecycle cost. And it starts with the exploration program. It goes into our development program getting the lower unit development costs, and then it goes into the production organization to find ways to drive that cost structure down. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas : Okay. Great Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Iain Reid with Macquarie. Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.: Yeah. Hi, Jeff. Couple of questions from me. Just firstly kind of philosophically, it looks like Exxon is at the sort of level in terms of oil and gas prices where your free cash flow is pretty much equivalent to your dividend. So I just wonder how that makes Exxon management's feel about maybe accelerating the pace of growth in terms of potentially more acquisitions or spending a bit more in terms of CapEx? And just is this the kind of level at which we can see somewhat of an inflection in terms of the pace of Exxon's investment plans? And I've got a follow-up after that. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Iain, I guess the first point I'd make is that, as I said, our free cash flow is $4.4 billion, our dividend is $3.1 billion, so we had excess of $1.3 billion. And then, to remind you that we also funded this escrow account for the InterOil transaction of $1.7 billion. So round number is about $3 billion excess cash. And I think, again, it really speaks to the effectiveness of our business model. Now, going back to the point around the pace of our investment program, that pace is going to be driven by value optimization. It is going to be driven by our ability to get our portfolio to a place where we think we have the optimal value, and we're ready to move forward. And it's not a constraint by the balance sheet or the amount of cash that we're generating at this point, but to be transparent, I mean we do step back and we look at the macro and look at the near-term period to make sure that we retain that financial flexibility. But we're not going to forego opportunities. If we think that we see one in terms of additional acreage to pick up or an acquisition or a unique opportunity to go ahead and progress investments in a lower cost structure or in other arrangements, then, we're going to proceed with it and we've got that capability to move when it's appropriate. Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.: Yeah. And that kind of brings me on to my second question. You've used your shares for two of the kind of major transactions which you've completed in the quarter, or at least announced in the quarter. That seems to me a very obvious thing to do given the rate in which your shares trade on certainly relative to your peers. I wonder is that your kind of favored method of transacting when you're buying assets. What advantage do you think that gives you over using cash? And in terms of this dilution which you talked about earlier about buying back the dilution, do you intend, as a kind of priority, to buy back the dilution which you're creating by using your shares as an acquisition currency? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: There's a couple elements in that. The first point I'd make is that we have the flexibility to do either. The final structure of that transaction will be a function of the dialogue between buyer and seller. And as you know, over the last three transactions, one was cash, two were stock, but we've got the capability to do either and I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of a preferred approach. The second point is on dilution. Since the merger of Exxon and Mobil around 2000, we have bought back about 40% of outstanding shares. So it's a tremendous progress when you think about it over the years, and that is one of the things that we believe is a tax efficient way to distribute excess cash to our shareholders. Iain Reid - Macquarie Capital (Europe) Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome, Iain. Operator : And we will now hear from Anish Kapadia with TPH. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Hi, Jeff. My first question is just thinking back over the last few years. It doesn't seem like you FID'd a major Upstream project in the last three years through the down cycle. And I suppose you haven't seen the countercyclical investment coming through from Exxon that maybe some would have expected. Can you just talk about what's kind of the reasons behind the lack of FIDs over the last few years? Was it waiting for costs to come down? Is it the project queue that you've got? And how could that change going forward? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, Anish, I mean the first point just to make sure everybody understands that in 2016, we did have six FIDs. We had two in the Upstream, two in the Downstream and two in the Chemical. Probably, the biggest one in the Upstream was the Tengiz expansion. We have announced two FIDs in 2017 both in the Downstream at this point. I would tell you that there were several factors that play into the pace of our FIDs, one, obviously, being the ability to make sure that we're comfortable, that we've gotten all the value out of the opportunity, particularly when you're in a down cycle, there are opportunities to step back and look at are there other ways now in the current business climate that we can go ahead and generate more value from it. And we've done exactly that. As I said a moment ago, over the last several years, the projects that have been closer to FIDs, we've been able to get about 30% out of the cost. So it's a very keen sense of have we fully optimized the value proposition for these investments. When we get to that point, we've got the financial flexibility to move forward, and we want to make sure that these investments, as we always have historically, are durable in a low price environment. And I think that will really set the pace going forward. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : And to follow up, maybe just drilling down a little bit more into that, specifically, in West Africa. When I look at Nigeria, there's been a number of projects that you've had on books for a long time in that pre-FID category that don't seem to have made much progress. I think in your latest Financial and Operating Review, we've seen some projects disappear out like the Uge development. I think the Satellite Fields Development capacity has been cut down. So I'm just wondering in terms of Nigeria, is it the cost that's still a problem? Is it the politics? I just wanted to get a little bit of an update on how things are going there. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I mean, you're really touching on another element of pace, and that is making sure that we've got certain stability within our commercial structure, and that all the partners have the capability to go move forward and fund these projects. But just to make sure the record is clear, over the last five years, we have had four startups, Erha North Phase 2s, the Satellite Fields Development Phase 1, Usan, so we've had a number of startups. There are a number, as you point out appropriately, they are on the development planning exercise, and that'll be a function of some of these variables locking up. We need to make sure that we've got a \u2013 not only have we optimized the design, but that the co-venturers are all ready to move forward and that we have a very clear view of the fiscal stability. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Great. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next participant is Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. A quick one about Guyana. Given that you're going to be one of the very few operators anywhere in the world to reach FID in 2017, can you just talk directionally about how the supplier contracting process has been as you've been approaching project sanction in terms of cost, competitiveness, et cetera? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, Pavel, as I've talked to, we work very closely with our contractors, our service providers, to identify win-win outcomes to ensure that we've got the optimal development scope defined and that has continued to work extremely well. I think everybody is really excited about the opportunity in Guyana and I think there's a lot of enthusiasm moving forward, and with that comes a lot of good thoughts and innovation. So specifically, in terms of cost, I'd only point to the progress that we've made that we shared at the analyst presentation that we've reduced the cost structure by about 30% in the suite of projects that we're progressing. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then, just a quick housekeeping item about African liquids. That was the steepest decline in your portfolio year-over-year in Q1 down 25%. Is that Nigerian disruptions or other culprits behind that? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, I think you're referring to, I guess, both sequentially and quarter-on-quarter. It was due to entitlements and downtime. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Any particular country? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I mean entitlements, they're all PSC, and in the downtime, it's primarily in Nigeria. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Clear enough. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : And we have time for one final question. We will hear from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah, yes, thank you. Jeff, in terms of your short cycle activity, the industry is obviously ramping up creatively. You're now more exposed in the Permian. What are you seeing in terms of cost inflation for the kind of projects you're pursuing for the short cycle time? And is it something that you feel you'll be able to manage effectively? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, good morning, John. I would tell you that, broadly speaking, that the inflationary pressures that we've seen year-to-date are really fully offset by the efficiencies we've been able to capture. Clearly, as the activity picks up, there are going to be some cost pressures, but I can tell you that the organization is very focused on making sure that we drive those costs down. And I'll refer you to a couple of presentations that we've shown on that. The last one being in the analyst presentation where we showed the Permian cost reduction we've been able to achieve over the last couple years of about 46% on our field and 72% on the development cost, and we fully expect that the organization is going to continue to find ways to offset any type of cost pressures. John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Great. Thanks. That's it for me. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think the only other point I'd add to you, John, is that as you see activity pick up, the key will be also maintaining really strong efficiency and execution, so. John Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Agreed. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodbury for any closing remarks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, to conclude, again, I'd like to thank you for your time and the very thoughtful questions this morning. And I want to say that we do appreciate the trust our shareholders place in ExxonMobil, and we look forward to talking to you all in the future. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes the call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and welcome to ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement, shown on slide 2. Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our second quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $3.4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date cumulative earnings to $7.4 billion. First and foremost, we remain focused on business fundamentals; that is, operational integrity, costs, reliability, and disciplined investment, with the objective of growing value regardless of the commodity price environment. Cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded dividends and net investments in the business for the third consecutive quarter. We continued to advance key projects across the value chain for strategic growth, some of which I'll highlight later. In the Downstream and Chemical segments, we're investing to meet growing demand for higher-value specialty and differentiated commodity products across the globe. Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. The global economy maintained modest growth in the second quarter. In the U.S. and China, economic expansion accelerated compared to the previous quarter, while Japan and the Eurozone experienced steady growth rates. As you know, the commodity price environment weakened in the quarter, as both crude oil and natural gas prices decreased. Nonetheless, the global rig count increased, driven primarily by higher North American activity, compounding uncertainty, and future supply/demand balances. Refining margins improved with heavy industry maintenance and a change to summer gasoline specifications, whereas global chemical commodity margins showed signs of softening with new industry capacity coming online, as anticipated. Turning now to the financial results, as shown on slide 5, as indicated, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were $3.4 billion or $0.78 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $3.9 billion, down 24% from the prior-year period, as the corporation remains disciplined in its investment plans while delivering investment-class execution. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $7.1 billion. And at the end of the quarter, cash totaled $4 billion and debt was $41.9 billion, down $1.7 billion from the prior quarter. The next slide provides additional detail on sources of uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.9 billion to $4 billion. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items, and our ongoing asset management program yielded $7.1 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $3 billion. Debt reduction and other financing items decreased cash by $1.7 billion. Cash flow from operations and asset sales more than covered dividends and net investments, with an excess nearly $800 million. In the second quarter, ExxonMobil did not make any share repurchases to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the third quarter. Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segmented results, ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings increased $1.7 billion from the year-ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream and Downstream results and lower corporate charges due to one-time favorable tax items. In the sequential quarter comparison, shown on slide 8, earnings decreased $660 million due to weaker results from the Upstream and Chemical segments. This was partly offset by lower corporate charges due to one-time favorable tax items and stronger Downstream performance. On average, we expect corporate and financing expenses will continue to be between $400 million to $600 million per quarter in the near term. I'll note that our corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%, down from 40% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time items. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 9. Second quarter Upstream earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of nearly $900 million from the prior-year quarter, due to higher realizations. Crude prices rose about $3.50 per barrel versus a year-ago quarter, and gas realizations increased more than $1.00 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $140 million, largely because of sales timing and lower entitlements. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, we had a net underlift of more than 150,000 barrels per day. All other items increased earnings $140 million, driven by lower operating expenses. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $3.41 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Moving to slide 10, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, a decrease of nearly 1% compared to the second quarter of 2016. Liquids production was down 61,000 barrels per day, as new project volumes and buildup from work programs were more than offset by field decline and lower entitlements. Natural gas production increased 158 million cubic feet per day, as volumes from new projects and work program more than offset field decline, lower seasonal demand, and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands. Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 11, Upstream earnings were $1.1 billion less than in the first quarter of the year, as lower realizations for both liquids and gas reduced earnings by $390 million. Crude prices decreased more than $3.00 per barrel and natural gas fell $0.29 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings another $250 million. Negative sales timing effects, reduced demand, and increased downtime were partly offset by new project volumes. All other items further decreased earnings by $430 million. This is largely the result of asset management activity and higher operating expenses. Asset management impacts included our relinquishment of East Natuna, located offshore Indonesia, as we continue to high-grade our portfolio. Moving to slide 12, sequentially volumes decreased 5.5% or 229,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Liquids production decreased 64,000 barrels per day, driven by higher downtime. Natural gas production decreased 988 million cubic feet per day, as seasonal demand dropped significantly, but were partly offset by new project volumes and work program. Moving now to Downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 13, Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up $560 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. Stronger margins increased earnings by $220 million. Favorable volume and mix effects improved earnings by $90 million, mainly from lower planned maintenance, which resulted in higher throughput. All other items added $250 million, mostly from ongoing asset management activities, favorable foreign exchange effects, and lower turnaround costs. Turning to slide 14, Downstream earnings increased sequentially by $269 million. Stronger margins increased earnings by $200 million. Volume and mix effects improved earnings by $40 million, primarily driven by increased fuel sales. All other items further increased earnings by $30 million. Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results, starting on slide 15, second quarter Chemical earnings were $985 million, down $232 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker commodity margins decreased earnings by $40 million. Lower commodity volumes reduced earnings by $50 million. And all other items decreased earnings by $140 million, largely due to increased turnaround expenses and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. Moving to slide 16, Chemical earnings decreased sequentially by $186 million. Weaker commodity margins reduced earnings by $100 million. And all other items decreased earnings $90 million, primarily from increased turnaround and project-related expenses. Turning to slide 17 and a review of our Upstream business highlights, we continued to capture new high-quality acreage with recent portfolio additions offshore Australia, Equatorial Guinea, and Suriname. ExxonMobil will be the operator of each of these new blocks, with total over 3.5 million gross acres. While appraising the Muruk discovery in Papua New Guinea, we confirmed the presence of a second gas-bearing fault block. Production testing confirmed good quality reservoir with high deliverability. Further appraisal is needed to delineate this resource, but this discovery has helped to derisk several other leads, on trend with the fields in this area. In June, we successfully completed the tow-out and installation of the Hebron Platform, located offshore Eastern Canada. The 750,000-ton platform was towed over 350 kilometers from the Bull Arm construction site to the Hebron field in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. The facility is capable of producing 150,000 barrels per day, with a total estimated recovery of more than 700 million barrels of oil. Commissioning work is progressing and drilling began this month. The field is expected to start up before year end. The Odoptu Stage 2 project also remains on track for first oil by year end. A major milestone was achieved in June, when the final facility modules arrived on Sakhalin Island. Turning now to slide 18, we continue to make strong progress in the Greater Guyana-Suriname region. We recently announced the signing of a production sharing contract for Block 59 offshore Suriname. The 2.8 million-acre block will be operated by ExxonMobil with co-venturers Hess and Statoil. Block 59 is in deep water located approximately 190 miles in the Guyana-Suriname Basin. We look forward to leveraging our regional knowledge to help evaluate the block's potential. In Guyana, we're currently acquiring a large 3-D seismic survey over the Kaieteur block to assess resource potential. Also, the rig is currently on the Payara 2 delineation well, and initial results are encouraging. We've encountered nearly 60 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone, deeper than the previous lowest known oil in the first Payara well. This brings the total Payara discovery to about 500 million oil equivalent barrels. As a result, total gross recoverable resources on Stabroek Block are now estimated at 2.3 billion to 2.8 billion oil equivalent barrels. This higher estimate is driven by the results of Payara 2 and the previous Liza-4 well, which encountered more than 197 feet of high quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The rig will next move to drill the Turbot and then Ranger prospects. These two prospects represent new play tests on the Stabroek Block. Moving to slide 19 and still in Guyana, we reached final investment decision on Phase 1 of the Liza development. First oil is expected by 2020, less than five years after the initial discovery. Phase 1 will develop 450 million barrels of oil from a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel, with production capacity of 120,000 barrels per day. This development is expected to cost $4.4 billion, resulting in a unit development cost of less than $10 per barrel and a projected double-digit return, even in a flat $40 per barrel price environment. The combination of high resource quality and proven execution capabilities applied in today's lower-cost environment positions Liza for success. Development planning for a second phase has also progressed following the recent success at Liza 4, which confirms significant additional resources that underpin future phases. Successful well test of Liza 4 confirmed the anticipated superior well deliverability expected from this high-quality reservoir. We are certainly excited about the tremendous potential of Liza, Payara, and the greater Guyana Basin, and we look forward to working with the government and of course the people of Guyana in the years to come to develop this world-class asset. Moving to slide 20 for an update on our Permian development, ExxonMobil's Permian assets rank among the top-tier investment returns in our global portfolio. Strong drilling and completion execution in the Midland Basin has to date yielded unit development costs of about $7.00 per oil equivalent barrel. We've been steadily increasing our Permian drilling activity through 2017. And our current net production is more than 165,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 20% from the prior-year quarter. Despite growing industry activity in the Permian, we have successfully offset inflationary pressure through increased efficiencies and high recoveries per well. And this includes, amongst other factors, a continuing reduction in drilling days and cost per foot as well as further improvement in completion designs. We currently have 16 operated rigs in the Delaware and Midland Basins combined, and expect to reach 19 total rigs by the end of August. Specifically in the Delaware Basin, we just finished drilling our first operated well on the recently acquired acreage. This well has a lateral section of 12,500 feet, well above the industry average. As we further progress development and gain additional learning curve benefits, we anticipate extending lateral lengths, including leveraging our learnings from our recent completion of Bakken horizontal wells of over 3 miles. Our superior, highly contiguous acreage position in the Delaware Basin uniquely positions us to exploit longer laterals and drive down unit development costs. We also continue to optimize our logistics and infrastructure plans, including export capacity, gas gathering, and water handling. For example, ExxonMobil recently executed an agreement for Summit Midstream Partners to develop, own, and operate a new associated gas gathering and processing system servicing the northern Delaware Basin. I'm pleased with our progress to date, and anticipate that as activity continues to ramp up, we will continue capturing efficiencies. Our estimated unit development costs for the full northern Delaware acreage is $5 to $7 per oil equivalent barrel. Turning to slide 21 and our Downstream and Chemical business highlights, we continue to strengthen our portfolio by increasing feedstock and logistics flexibility, upgrading the value of hydrocarbon molecules, and expanding volumes of premium products. In May, we reached mechanical completion of two new 650,000 ton per year polyethylene lines at our plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The company expects production to begin during the third quarter of this year. Building on the success of our Gulf Coast initiatives, the corporation also continues to advance new opportunities to meet growing demand for ethylene and related products. We recently selected a site in South Texas for our proposed joint venture with SABIC to construct a world-scale petrochemical complex, including an ethane steam cracker and a monoethylene glycol unit and two polyethylene units. In May, the venture partner signed an agreement for the next phase of the project, which enables planning for front-end engineering and design work. Recognizing that Asia-Pacific continues to be the largest and fastest growing lubes market globally, we recently completed the expansion of our grease and synthetic lubricants operations in Singapore. The new synthetic lubricants plant is the only facility in the region that can manufacture Mobil 1. We're also increasing our basestock capacity in Asia, with the further expansion of our Group II production in Singapore. This value-driven investment underpins our continued leadership in basestock production. In the quarter, ExxonMobil also announced its plans to enter the Mexican fuel market with Mobil-branded stations and its advanced Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels. Through local partnerships, we plan to open our first Mobil service station in central Mexico during the second half of 2017, with additional stations to follow by year end. We plan to invest about $300 million in fuels, logistics, product inventories, and marketing over the next 10 years to provide a reliable supply of quality products to retail, wholesale, industrial, and commercial sectors. Finally, we continue to invest in research and development to position our long-term success. ExxonMobil and Synthetic Genomics have jointly researched biofuels for over eight years, and recently announced a breakthrough involving the modification of an algae strain that more than doubled its oil production. We are pleased to have achieved this important milestone, and we'll continue to progress the potential commercial application over the longer term. Turning to slide 22, we are also progressing a strategic acquisition in Singapore to grow our chemical capacity to meet increasing Asian product demand. ExxonMobil signed an agreement with Jurong Aromatics Corporation to acquire its plant, located on Jurong Island in Singapore. This aromatics plant is one of the largest in the world, with an annual production capacity of 1.4 million tons and also produces 65,000 barrels per day of fuels. Integration of this plant with ExxonMobil's existing manufacturing facility will provide product, operational, and logistical synergies that will enable cost-competitive growth of the aromatics business. As you may know, Singapore is home to ExxonMobil's largest integrated refining and petrochemical complex and has a crude oil processing capacity of almost 600,000 barrels per day, and includes two world-scale steam crackers with a capacity of 1.9 million tons per annum. Acquisition of the Jurong Aromatics plant will increase ExxonMobil's Singapore aromatics production to over 3.5 million tons per year, of which 1.8 million tons is paraxylene, used in polyester production. We're looking forward to closing this acquisition in the second half of this year. Turning now to slide 23, a summary of the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives and commitment to our shareholders. As shown, year-to-date 2017 cash flow from operations and asset sales of $16 billion funded shareholder distributions, net investments in the business, and a reduction in debt. Following the most recent drop in commercial prices, this is the third consecutive quarter where our free cash flow has exceeded our dividends to shareholders, reflecting capital discipline and the strength of the integrated businesses. And I'll note that the cash operating surplus in the second quarter is after covering a seasonal working capital build. Moving now to the final slide, I'll conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. Simply put, we remain focused on value growth through self-help and attractive investments. Our integrated businesses continue to generate solid cash flow and earnings. Our business segments collectively earned $7.4 billion, an increase of nearly $4 billion compared to the first half of 2016. Upstream production volumes were consistent with plans at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. We remain disciplined in our investment program, selectively advancing strategic opportunities across the value chain while maintaining focus on capital efficiencies. Year-to-date CapEx was $8.1 billion, a decrease of 21% from the prior year. Our capital guidance for 2017 remains at $22 billion, as we previously shared. Cash flow from operations and asset sales totaled $16 billion and free cash flow was $8.5 billion, more than covering $6.4 billion in shareholder distributions. Due to the strength of our integrated businesses, we remain confident in ExxonMobil's ability to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders in ever-changing industry conditions. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I would now be very happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we'll go first to Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, Jeff. How are you? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Neil. I'm doing fine, thank you. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Jeff, I asked you this question last quarter, but I always value your opinion on the oil macro. I just wanted to get ExxonMobil's perspective as a buyer of 5 million barrels a day of crude of where do you think we are in the rebalancing process and how you see the macro playing out going forward. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks, Neil. Let me just give you some observations. On the positive side, clearly demand continues to be relatively strong when you compare it against the 10-year average. We're likely to see demand growth about 1.5 million barrels this year. We are seeing some inventories, commercial inventories draw both on crude as well as products. Still quite a bit of inventory to go ahead and draw down. Of course, on the opposite side, working against the balances that we are seeing a significant build in production in several places, notably in North America, right now pretty much on trend to reach about an additional 1 million barrel a day capacity growth over the last, say, 12 to 18 months by year end. That's going to work against us in some regards. And of course, how other non-OPEC producers perform over the near term will have an effect. When you put all that together, you are seeing convergence of supply/demand in the second half of 2017. That will probably spread out again as demand drops in the first half of 2018. But I think I'd summarize by saying that we are seeing some progress towards a healthier balance. But as I indicated, there are a lot of variables in play. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I appreciate those comments. The follow-up is on gas. You have a lot of optionality on global gas with PNG, with the InterOil acquisition, Mozambique, and there's talk about the potential for expansion in Qatar. Can you just comment on each of the three opportunities and then how Exxon is thinking about prioritizing the different options you might have here? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: As you said, Neil, we do have a lot of optionality here. As part of our diverse resource base, we've got a very large presence in gas. We see gas, as you may recall from our energy outlook, growing about 1.5% per year between now and 2040, so that really sets up the investment basis. We're progressing all of these opportunities forward. As you can appreciate, there are a lot of variables that will determine the pace, and some of these will likely move quicker than others. When you think about the full spectrum of the portfolio, those that are what I would characterize as brownfield expansions of existing operations are probably going to add some of the lowest cost of supply. I'd note specifically Papua New Guinea, where we have built up a very substantial resource base, starting with the foundation project that has exceeded the original scope in terms of offtake and total resource, to the success of our exploration program. And as you know, the acquisition of the InterOil assets, that positions us very well to expand that facility, and I'd suggest that that's going to be on the left side of the cost of supply curve. To some other very large resources, like the acquisitions we're pursuing in Mozambique that are also going to be very competitive on a cost and supply, as well as our continued interest in supporting the objective of our partners in Qatar, which we take a lot of pride in supporting their ultimate plans for the North Field. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, Jeff. Can you hear me okay? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, I can, Doug. Good morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, a couple things, maybe two questions, if I may. The first one is on volumes in the second quarter. Is there anything unusual going on in Europe? I know that production is typically seasonally weak annually, but it just looks \u2013 down about 20% year over year looks unusually low. And related, I guess Canada volumes, oil volumes were down also, and I'm guessing that's maintenance. Can you speak to some of the moving parts in the quarter? Because obviously international E&P seemed weak. And we're just trying to get a handle on whether there's something changing here which has some leaks, or if it's really just one-off seasonality? And I got a follow-up, please. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks for the question, Doug, and you're right. We are pretty low in the second quarter, and there are a couple of drivers for that, as I said my prepared comments. We saw pretty significant downtime in a couple of regions, one being Canada, as you highlighted. We had a turnaround in Kearl. We also, as has been pretty well publicized, Syncrude has been down. We expect Syncrude to ramp up to full capacity by August. Staying on the liquids side, we had some downtime in Nigeria and West Africa as well. The second quarter tends to have a lot more of our planned maintenance activities in the upstream. On the gas side, one of the biggest drops was the reduction in the European gas demand. Of course, that is seasonal in nature. On top of that, as I said in my prepared comments, there are some impacts associated with the regulatory restrictions at Groningen. On the positive side, I think it's important to highlight that we've had some really significant builds, and some of these projects have come on really good progress in places like Upper Zakum, Kashagan. We continue to ramp up some of our additional projects that started up over the last one or two years. And then the last negative I'd highlight, which is real clear on the chart, is that there was a significant liquids decrease associated with entitlement volumes, which as you know, is really a price-driven impact. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, I appreciate the lengthy answer, thanks. I guess my follow-up, I realize you just reiterated the spending guidance for the year, Jeff, but realistically you're running very light at the half-year level. Even with the Bakken loaded spending, the number still looks a little bit aggressive on the back end. Can you just speak to that in terms of are you just being really conservative here, or do you really expect that significant ramp up in the run rate spending in the second half of the year? And I'll leave it there, thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Doug. Well I can certainly appreciate that view, and we are spending lower, if you will, on a season-wise basis. And I'd bucket them into really two categories, one being timing-related, and the second one being that the organization has continued to make significant efforts to capture new efficiencies, and we are seeing those capital efficiencies in that performance. On the timing side, we got a couple things that I'll share with you. One obviously is we've got two acquisitions that we are working to close by the end of the year, the two being Mozambique and the Jurong Aromatics Corporation acquisition. We also, as I indicated in my prepared comments, are ramping up our Permian activity as well. Those factors lead us to the view that we want to keep the guidance flat. In some regards, you can say there's some upward pressure to that, but we've got full confidence in the organization that we'll continue to capture additional savings as we go forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : You made a point a few minutes ago about growing value, and several of your peers have become much more focused on return on capital employed during the past year. And besides more disciplined spending, they've increased divestitures to try and realize greater value from their portfolios. And because returns for all companies have declined over the past couple of years and because you pulled this lever slightly less than your peers over time, not a ton less but slightly less, my question is, how do you guys think about the opportunity for value creation from this mechanism? Meaning it's not new, but are there reasons to step up or not step up your program at this time given the current environment where assets are starting to pretty freely trade hands? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah Doug, just a couple thoughts to share with you on that regard. First, I'd also say that we have had a continual asset management program, and we've shared the total value benefit from that in the past. But when you look at that, for us it's not a defined we're going to sell X amount of assets over a defined timeframe. It's an ongoing focus around how do you high-grade the overall portfolio. And I can share three key components of doing that. One is clearly identifying new highly accretive assets that can compete in your portfolio through exploration activity or acquisitions. And then the second one, the last one being that this ongoing program to monetize what we see as assets that may be of greater value to others. And if you look at our annual performance on that, we're selling anywhere between $2 billion to $4 billion of assets per year. If you look at, say, over the last five years, that equates to about over $20 billion from those asset sales. So we maintain a very active program. This is not a fire sale. This is all about the fundamental objective of this corporation is to grow value, and the decisions are value-based. If we see that we can get that value through monetizing it through a sale, then we'll go ahead and proceed with it. But we like the portfolio. We've been very successful in ensuring that there's a constant high-grading of that portfolio. And then you think in the \u2013 I want to talk about the broader comment about return on capital employed. The fundamental objective of our investment program is to be very selective on how we can grow our value proposition, and ultimately that will evidence itself in the return on capital employed. If you think about from the Upstream through the Downstream and Chemicals, it's all about that value chain investment to provide accretive financial performance. So very strong discipline, and we've never lost our view on that. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then also, Jeff, the Downstream has historically been an area of industry leadership for ExxonMobil, and needless to say, it still is. But in this area, your results seem to have lagged your peers during the past 6 to 12 months, again, not a ton but there seems to be a little leakage. And so my question was whether or not you had any insight into this outcome, not so much from a return on capital perspective, which is probably explained by changes in pre-productive capital with your new projects. But is there anything from a margin or earnings perspective or anything else that might be worth mentioning about the Downstream performance? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: The only thing I would share with you on that, Doug, that again I'm not sure what your reference point is, but we did have a fairly heavy maintenance period in the first half of the year. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think we completed about 85% of our overall planned maintenance in the first six months of the year. I will focus also on the very strategic investments that we're making throughout the Downstream. It's a good example of how we're not necessarily growing volume but we're going value, where we're going ahead and upgrading lower-value products like marine fuel oil to higher-value products like ultra-low sulfur diesel or lube basestocks. Specific projects, Antwerp is doing that. Rotterdam is doing that using proprietary technology. Should take us to the largest Group II basestock producer in Europe. So it really demonstrates how the investment is very focused, very strategic, and all underpins that value proposition. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Doug. Operator : And we'll now move next to Sam Margolin of Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, Jeff. How are you? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess we'll start with Liza just because it sounds like there has been some developments there. So as the recoverable resource reserve gets bigger and bigger, are there any other factors in place with the development that might be changing? Is this project getting more complicated or less complicated as you're building economies of scale? And just curious about your thoughts around development impacts of the resource increasing in ongoing discoveries. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: The short answer is we really like what we've got, Sam, and we've got significant scope to continue to increase the resource. As you can see, we've grown the acreage substantially to I think about 14 million gross acres now with the additional pickup of Suriname. Yes, clearly you can see the model that we've employed here is that we're trying to get production or a revenue stream on pretty quick through this leased FPSO approach. Five years from discovery to startup is industry leading. At the same time, we'll continue to maintain the ongoing exploration and appraisal program. That, as you've seen in our recent communication, has continued to build the resource base, positioning us for subsequent phases of development. And you can see the analogue we've got here with what we did in Angola Block 15, where we got out there early with a leased FPSO to get a revenue stream on it. We maintained our exploration program. We built mass. It allows us to get into much more of a manufacturing process. We designed one template and then we go ahead and build that template throughout the development of the resource. And that allows us ultimately to make this value proposition that I talked about with Doug previously, drive that unit development cost down, and maximize the results. So as I indicated in my prepared comments, very excited about where we are, a lot of activity going on and a lot of scope. This is exactly what we want to be doing right now. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then I guess moving on to Permian, since you're accelerating there currently right now too, you did mention some inflation, but you have offsets with efficiencies and application of some I guess development techniques that you've developed in other areas. Is there any critical mass? Is there any tipping point there, or do you think that you'll continue to be able to beat out these inflationary trends with production technique? Just because it does sound like you're adding rigs and laterals are getting longer. Service intensity does seem to be increasing. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, well I mean clearly as I indicated previously, we are really trying to keep the organization focused on progressing various structural efficiency savings going forward. As I said in the prepared comments, it's through some of the execution, but it's also driving our unit development costs down, leveraging the global scale of our organization through our procurement business. And we've got that unique structure. We've the procurement organization that's really focused on driving the cost down over the lifecycle of the asset, and across the business have made significant gains. If I back up and talk corporate-wide, we are seeing some inflationary pressures. They're very localized on specific services, but the organization is fully offsetting those costs as we go forward. Taking it down to Permian, we're being very strategic in terms of our forward development planning and execution. I mentioned by way of example, we're thinking about the logistical and the supply chain requirements. So we're planning on all that, and all that effort is driving that unit development cost down and offsetting those inflationary pressures. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. Operator : And now we'll go to Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, good morning, Jeff. Just a quick one, on the buyback, will you continue with the anti-dilutionary buybacks, or is it all suspended? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Yes, we will, to the extent that we are buying or need to maintain anti-dilution, but right now in the quarter we didn't have any. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, but it might continue in Q3? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It's usually a couple \u2013 I don't remember which month it is, Paul, but it's really tied to our overall benefits plans. Typically we see in it the first quarter. But it's... Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, thanks. That's good enough, Jeff. Go ahead. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Go ahead, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : No, I was going to suddenly change the subject. Could you talk through Mozambique? There's been \u2013 obviously you've made a significant move there. Could you just outline what's going on there? Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Sure, so Mozambique, as I indicated when Neil asked the question, is clearly another big opportunity for us to leverage our capabilities, to really go ahead and bring what we think is going to be a very competitive cost of supply to market. As we announced earlier this year, we went ahead and executed an agreement with Eni to pick up indirect interest of about 25%. That's a cash transaction that was valued at about $2.8 billion, but it is subject to government approvals, and that's what we're working through right now. In that arrangement, ExxonMobil will take responsibility for operating the midstream, which will involve leading the construction and operation of onshore facilities. I will tell you that when we get to that point once we've gotten the necessary approvals and we are able to close the transaction, we'll get involved certainly with all the co-ventures, the government, and even Area 1 to look at how further synergies can be captured, recognizing the potential growth and development in that specific area. But I'd say a very large resource. Area 4 contains more 85 trillion cubic feet in place. And we think it's going to compete very well on the left side of that cost of supply curve. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. And just forgive me for asking three, but the situation in Qatar and the announcement from Qatar on expansion, firstly, how have the sanctions in any way impacted you? And secondly, how would that fit going forward in terms of the massive expansion that they've announced? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: So there are no sanctions with Qatar, but I think what you're referring to is the diplomatic issues amongst the Middle Eastern countries. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Right. Yes, obviously not the U.S. sanctions, yes. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. Simply put, we've not experienced any impacts to LNG production or exports. With respect to the aspirations of Qatar to further expand their LNG capacity, I'd put it this way, Paul, that as you know, Qatar is a very important partnership for us. We are very proud of the contributions that we made in supporting Qatar's evolution as what we believe is the world's largest LNG supplier of LNG. As you look forward, we'll continue to support Qatar. We're very interested in future investments, and we're very interested in supporting their stated objectives. It's a very strong relationship, and I think we're very well positioned. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Paul. Operator : And we'll now move to Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Evan Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I had a quick question on Guyana, where you've had great success. Given the returns, better returns I presume, at the top of your gating process, how do you think about accelerating subsequent developments to maximize the value of this resource base? Meaning with several phases underpinned past Liza, is there a scope for a faster pace of development than Kizomba or faster than an FPSO every two to three years? What are the thoughts there? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It's a great question, and I think it really talks to the development planning process that we go through. We're doing a lot of this activity in parallel. We took our largest 3D seismic acquisition. We're analyzing that. We're integrating real-time the drill well data that we're collecting, and we're building that into the process. One of the ways to get that faster pace is being able to put in place a standard template as we go forward and develop these assets. As I indicated in my prepared comments, we're already looking at the subsequent phases in Guyana. And to the extent that we can standardize that template, I think it's going to allow us to move quicker. But it goes right back to the fundamental objective that we're looking for, and that is how do we maximize the value for this investment. And we'll certainly keep a very close watch on where we can capture through learning curve benefits additional capital efficiencies. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But it sounds like Kizomba is a good model for now. Is that fair? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, it was a very successful outcome for the corporation, and it certainly demonstrated its value proposition, and it's a good model going forward. Now of course, our desire is to just continue to see additional success in our exploration program. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. The second, in the Permian, there's a chart on slide 20. It's the chart at the bottom right. It seems to indicate the potential for up to a 20,000-foot lateral. That's clearly a function of your contiguous position, and I also know you guys hold the record in lateral drilling in Sakhalin conventional. Can you talk about plans to test at that length or discuss \u2013 is it too early or could you discuss any technical challenges you see from either completion or equipment perspective? And that's it, a pretty long lateral. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks for your question, Evan. This is in our wheelhouse. It's all about leveraging our technology to achieve these types of aspirational objectives. A couple data points I'd give you. One is, as you indicated, we've got very strong success with our drilling execution. We've got a number of execution processes that allows us to fully analyze the physics associated with drilling that allows us to overcome some of the impediments to be able to achieve those type of outcomes. The second point I'd make, as I said in my comments, we just finished drilling over 3-mile long Bakken wells. That's allowed us to really inform ourselves, and that's all being integrated real-time into our ongoing \u2013 let me say our ongoing unconventional drilling program, but notably in the Permian. So it's a very strong focus on thinking about what are those limiting factors and how do we push it out even further. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I look forward to hear. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Operator : We will now go to Phil Gresh of JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, Jeff. Sorry about that. First question is around the capital spending and the acquisition, the two acquisitions you're talking about. Could you quantify those for me? I know what Jurong and Mozambique is. But if you put the two together, how much of an impact is that on the full-year guidance? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Phil. The Mozambique acquisition, as I said, was $2.8 billion. The Jurong Aromatics acquisition, the actual acquisition price has been confidential. It's not been disclosed. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So I guess as I think about \u2013 I guess I'm asking a similar question again here. But as I think about your comments about including those numbers in the full-year guidance of $22 billion, and you talk about some upward pressure from inflation, is there also a significant increase in activity level you're expecting in the second half of the year? I'm just trying to tie out why we'd have such a big increase in the back half. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, sure, a couple points that I'll just reiterate. One is we are seeing some very good progress beyond what we had in our business plan in terms of some additional efficiency benefits that we're capturing. But there is a lot of timing implications associated with not only the acquisitions in the second half, but we've got, as I said, the ramp up in our Permian activity. But also there's a number of big projects that just the spend profile ends up being a little bit more skewed to the second half of the year, particularly in our development company and our Chemical business. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I guess as we think about the longer-term guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day of $25 billion annualized 2018 through 2020, I guess is what you're implying here that the second half ramp is the reason we get to the run rate of about $25 billion for the next couple years, up from $22 billion this year? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, it's a good question, Phil. I understand where you're going with it. I wouldn't try to anchor the second half 2017 spend on the projection that we provided in the analyst meeting for 2018 forward. Ballpark, we're going to see anywhere between $20 billion to $25 billion going forward. We're pretty comfortable with the range that we had provided earlier this year as an outlook out to 2020. It's going to moderate based on progress on certain projects and some new opportunities that have been brought into the portfolio. So as a rule going forward, if you think that we stick with around $22 billion in 2017, slowly ramping up through the end of the decade is the way I think about it. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure, that makes sense. Thanks a lot. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Phil. Operator : Our next question will come from Brendan Warn of BMO Capital Markets. Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question. Just back on Liza or Guyana, I just want to ask a question about Turbot and Ranger. You talk about them as being, call it, new play tests. Are they different, call it, horizons, different prospect types? Can you just probably expand on that comment in terms of what are the additional risks related to the step-outs on that block? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks for raising that, Brendan, because it is an important point to make because any type of ranked well-cap exploration has got a fairly material risk to it. Turbot is still in the upper cretaceous. It's still a stratigraphic trap, but it is in a different fairway or depositional environment than Liza, Snoek, and Payara. The Ranger prospect, the analysis that we've done really suggests a large carbonate buildup. So higher risk and uncertainty, but obviously we see the potential as being material to justify that risk profile. Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: Actually the follow-up to that then, if it's carbonate, are we talking the same source from the Cenomanian-Turonian? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I'm sorry, Brendan. Can you say that once again? Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: So for Ranger, is it still the same source rock from the CT? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Maybe, it's probably early to fully conclude that, but potentially. As I indicated earlier, we've got a lot of things going on in parallel right now in our analytical work. Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank has our next question. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff, maybe one high-level question on your thoughts around the Gulf Coast initiatives that you have down there. Can you talk a little bit about the potential expansions that you see there? I know with some of them you talked about the potential petchem expansions. Are there likely to be refining expansions? And how do see the Gulf Coast region? Do you see it as a strategically advantaged location for exports of everything from refined products to petchems? And how does that figure into your long-term strategic plans there? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: In fact, you answered where I was going to start. Strategically, it's very well positioned in terms of the feed advantage, the unconventional resource base, the infrastructure and the linkage on that infrastructure, the integration that we have throughout our facilities, the full integration of fuels, lubricants, and petrochemicals, the logistics capability. All those factors really position it very well. As part of our Gulf Coast initiatives program, we've had a number of very successful projects that we've implemented. The ones that are in progress right now is obviously the big Baytown expansion. That adds another 1.5 million tons per annum of ethylene capacity. I referenced in my prepared comments the corresponding polyethylene trains that are starting up in the third quarter. We've got an expansion going on at Beaumont for additional polyethylene trains. And then we've got the big greenfield development down in South Texas potentially with our partner SABIC that will add that additional 1.8 million tons of additional ethylene capacity and then associated derivative units. And now on the Upstream side, we are still moving forward with an assessment of the Golden Pass LNG export facility. You may be aware that in April of this year that the Department of Energy finally authorized Golden Pass to export LNG to countries that do not have free trade agreements with the U.S. That was really one of the last big significant authorizations we were looking for. And now we're focused more on bringing together all the remaining elements to really position the project for a potential final investment decision, specifically looking at and updating the technical and commercial details at this point. So that's a high-level summary of the benefits of what we see the Gulf Coast brings as well as the investments that we're progressing. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. It's mostly I guess petchem and LNG. Are we likely to see any type of refining expansion down there? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: As part of this whole Gulf Coast initiative, we have made some investments to expand. For instance in Beaumont, we added something like 20,000 barrels a day of additional feedstock capacity that allow us to have the capability of bringing in more of the unconventional feedstock or production for feedstock. So we've made a lot of investments to really focus in on the following areas, either building logistics flexibility, building feedstock flexibility, but importantly, focused on the integrated benefits of the facilities and really increasing the value of the products that we make at those manufacturing sites. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And maybe as a quick follow-up on that, I saw the announcement of the expansion there in Mexico. How big of an opportunity could this be? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: We're certainly pleased with the business climate where it has moved to. It's an attractive market for, as we just were talking about, our Gulf Coast refining. We have a reliable facility, and this is a good outlet. We've had a very long history in Mexico, and I think it positions us well. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We will move next to Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Maybe to just come back to CapEx real quick so I can understand some of the moving parts here, the two acquisitions, are those going to be cash-only or cash and shares? I'm just trying to think of the impact on cash flow in the second half. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Those will be cash transactions. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then as we think about the guidance that CapEx slowly trends higher through the end of the decade, presumably you don't build acquisitions into that CapEx assumption. So should we think about that as field development, exploration, et cetera, the CapEx spending, or should we build in an acquisition expectation in that? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: By and large, you're exactly right. Unless there's something that's in the works that we feel fairly confident with, we will not include it in that projection. Now I'll be clear. Mozambique was in that outlook we shared in March during that analyst meeting. We just didn't highlight it because it wasn't ready for prime time. But we'll go ahead, and depending on where we are, we'll represent it accordingly. Important to highlight is that we've got a very \u2013 and you know this, Roger, we've got a very strong balance sheet. It allows us to capitalize on the moments, regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle. And I think you just look back over the last six to nine months, we've been able to pick up four very accretive, very high-quality assets that really meet the objective that we're trying to achieve with high-grading the portfolio. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No absolutely, I appreciate the longer-term view that you're able to take. And then my follow-up question, I think it was slide 20, estimated project development costs in the Delaware Basin of $5 to $7 per BOE. Multiple benches out there, so is the $5 to $7 looking at the development over the course of 10 or 15 or longer years, or is this the way to think about Phase 1? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: If you remember when we communicated the acquisition, we laid out a long-term development expectation, a certain level of rig activity. Total buildup I think was about 350,000-plus oil equivalent barrels per day, so it was a long-term view of the development of this northern acreage in the Delaware. That's what that represents. It's the overall assessed scope that we had built in to develop it based on, if you will, our technical assessment that underpinned our decision to go ahead and assess or acquire the asset. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Roger. Operator : And now we'll move next to Blake Fernandez of Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey, Jeff. Good morning. I was hoping to go back to the volume question, the production question. I know you already tackled the European rollover, but I'm trying to get a sense of how much is associated with just pure seasonality and how much is more regulatory Groningen effect. Is there a way you can quantify the quarter-to-quarter change that's down about 159,000 barrels a day in gas? Can you quantify how much of that is actually Groningen? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, so if you look on quarter to the prior quarter, my recollection is about 90 million cubic feet per day was associated with the cap impact. That was the second quarter 2017 to the second quarter of 2016. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. The second question is on your slide showing the free cash flow above dividend. You had mentioned your debt has definitely been working down over the past year, and I guess I'm just trying to understand the appetite for reimplementing the buyback program over and above offsetting dilution versus reinvestment into the business. Obviously, you've got a whole host of acquisitions that are underway, so it seems to me like your appetite is more geared toward acquisition opportunities rather than buying back stock. But I just didn't know if you had any commentary you could offer there. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Blake, I'd pitch it this way, that if an opportunity comes along from an acquisition perspective that we think would be very competitive to our existing investment portfolio, we're certainly going to go ahead and pursue it. And as I said earlier, we have the financial capability to do that regardless of where we are in the commodity price cycle. The buyback decision really steps back, and I think I've mentioned this before. If you think about our capital allocation approach, it really is founded on being committed to a reliable and growing dividend and at the same time continuing to invest in accretive investment opportunities. With the remaining cash, then the decision is around how do you put that to additional work, how do you distribute it to your shareholders if you feel that's appropriate. And that's really viewed on a quarterly basis where we step and we consider is there some debt that's maturing that we'll go ahead and close out, or does it make sense to go ahead and purchase some shares with it. So think about it as a separate \u2013 it's part of the overall cash management that we'll consider that on. But we like the trend we're on. And regardless of what commodity prices do, if you pick up anything from me, it's one of through our self-help and through our investment program, we are building value. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Howard Weil : Understood, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : We will now move to Paul Cheng of Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jeff, on the warning, can I go back? In Africa year over year there's a 50 target in your liquid production. I think you mentioned that you have healthier than, maybe healthier turnaround activities there. But you also have a sale of I think some Nigerian operation. So I'm trying to understand that. How big is the job year over year? In the first half of the year it's related to sale, or is that more structural? And how much is really just more activity? And also you mentioned in your prepared remarks you have a underlift this quarter, 150,000 barrels per day. Do you have an earnings impact related that? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, so a couple points. On the first one you were talking about the decline that we've seen in our Africa volumes, and there are several things that are driving that. One has to do with natural decline in Africa. The second one has to do with there has been a reasonable amount of downtime that we've experienced. And then the third one that I mentioned earlier was the entitlement impacts due to the commodity prices. I would summarize that those are probably the three key areas that are driving the volumes in Africa right now. The second question about the underlift and the earnings impact, it's a large part of that component. I think it's in excess of $100 million-plus earnings impact associated with it on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And the final one on Liza, in Phase 1 you're reinjecting the gas. I think the estimated gas resource is maybe about 20% of the total BOE, or maybe a little bit more, a little bit less. In the future phases, will you be able to still just reinject, or do you actually have to fund the infrastructure to develop it? And if that's the case, given that the a lack of infrastructure over there, what kind of cost component that we may be talking about? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, well Paul, as you said in the Phase 1, the plan is that we will reinject the gas into the reservoir. Going forward in subsequent phases, obviously that's a key aspect of our development planning efforts. I think it's probably too early to signal where we end up on that, but that will certainly be an area of dialogue with the resource owner and making sure that we're meeting their objectives as well. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. All right, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Paul. Operator : We will now move to Anish Kapadia of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Hi, Jeff. Just a first question on the overall LNG market. You're obviously seen (74:48) announcement, yourselves adding quite a lot of potential capacity over the next decade from Mozambique. So I was just wondering, how have your conversations been with LNG buyers? Have you signed any deals this year in terms of your future projects? Because obviously, we've see on the other side of the equation companies canceling projects such as a large project in Canada that was announced in the last week or so. I just wanted to get an idea of how those conversations with the LNG buyers are going. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, well I guess a couple points to share with you, Anish. First, again, our forward-looking perspective around the LNG development opportunity is really underpinned by our energy outlook, which with gas growing at 1.5% per year throughout the period out to 2040, that translates into LNG capacity growing 2.5 times. As it relates to our interaction with potential buyers, obviously, I can't share the specifics. That's part of those confidential discussions, but I will note that there have been a number of announcements that we've released regarding heads of agreements, one of them having to be, I think was in Indonesia for an extended period sale. There were others that were announced. I just don't have them all in front of me, Anish. But I think the message you should understand is that we have a very large program right now. We've got a very strong marketing organization, and we have continued to underpin our LNG investment decisions, our final investment decisions with long-term contract structure that helps ensure the return expectations on those investments. And rest assured, we've got active marketing programs in place. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Right. And just a very quick follow-up is you mentioned I think some asset sale gains in the quarter that helped the results. Could you quantify what those were on an earnings basis? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes. On an earnings basis, Anish, in the second quarter, it was $68 million, and all of that was in the Downstream. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Many thanks. Operator : We will now go to Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP Paribas. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.: Yes. Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got just two actually, please. I think you discussed the broadening of the fuels marketing business in Mexico. But is there a broader strategy there for Exxon to invest more aggressively in fuels marketing, and where are those opportunities as you see them today? And then secondly, we've talked about the deepwater and Liza and Guyana. But I was just wondering whether you saw opportunities for Exxon in the bidding rounds coming up in Brazil. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well Theepan, thanks for the questions. On our fuels marketing, you may be aware that we had transitioned to a branded wholesale model, really with a focus of expanding our market share and brand, and at the same time reducing our capital and operational risk, and that's worked very well. We're seeing some really good pickup out there with these branded wholesale opportunities. And we see that as an important element of our value proposition going forward. Of course, in conjunction with that is that we're rolling out at the same time and expanding our signature line on Synergy gasoline and diesel fuels. So it's the whole package that's important in terms of our overall expansion of this branded wholesale model. On the second question about our interest in participating in Brazil, in short, no doubt about it, Theepan, Brazil has a very nice endowment, resource endowment, high quality, great geology. We need to see what's being offered in terms of the potential blocks as well as the participation structure, and that will guide us in terms to the level of interest that we will progress. And you think about it from a benchmark perspective, we're looking for things like Guyana with really high quality, really good, if you will, risk/reward structure on how we manage this portfolio going forward. We do have a bias towards wanting to operate these assets because we think through our long-established project management capabilities and our ability to continue to grow the value proposition, once we make the investment and all the way through the lifecycle of the asset, that we tend to get more out of it. So I'll leave it there, but you can get the sense that certainly very interested, it's just got to compete with the rest of the portfolio. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane Ltd.: Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : We will now move to a question from Biraj Borkhataria of Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Europe Ltd.: Hi, Jeff. Thanks for taking my questions, I had a couple. The first one was on Guyana and back on Liza. Based on what you see now, would you be able to give us your blue-sky scenario for the resource base and how you think that can go over the next year or two? And then the second question on LNG relating to Mozambique, so you acquired 25% of the project. One of your peers has talked about the willingness to take on more than their equity interest as an offtake volume in order to enhance the portfolio. Is that something you would be interested in for that project? Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, on the first one, what I just summarized, other than what we've already communicated at this point, Biraj, around what we anticipate as a recoverable resource, as you can see from the display that we shared with you, there's a lot of potential plays there. They've got very material potential. It's really too early for us to go ahead and share what we think the ultimate resource potential is. You may recall that it was stated back at the analyst meeting that we clearly see multiple billion-barrel potential for the blocks. In fact, we're there today, but we're very encouraged. And I think the additional seismic acquisition, the analysis that we\\re doing, and the drilling that we're doing is going to help us converge on a look, on a view longer term. Can you tell me again the second question you had about what you're hearing from a competitor? Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Europe Ltd.: So one of your peers has talked about their willingness to take on more than their share of the equity interest. So for example, you have of 25% interest in Mozambique. Would you be willing to take on say 50% of the offtake volumes? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Again, early days. We need to get into the venture structure here hopefully within the end of the year. and then we're always open to potential opportunities, again, as long as it competes with the portfolio that we've got right now. But I'm not going to speculate on market rumors or whatnot because I'm really not familiar with the specifics that you shared. Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Europe Ltd.: Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We will now take a question from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. First on PNG, many of your shareholders came into the stock based on their InterOil ownership. And for their benefit, I'm wondering if you can give an update on the resource certification of the Elk-Antelope field and the contingent value rights? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, thanks for asking the question, Pavel. Certainly, I know there are many that are interested in how that closes out. As you know, we completed the Antelope well that we were drilling, and the resource certification process is in progress. The plan is that will be concluded in the third quarter, and then the final results will be shared as per the arrangement. So I'm hopeful that that will come to closure soon. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, very helpful, and then one more on Europe. You talked about the year-over-year decline in Groningen, but there is an additional further cap that you guys are currently appealing. If that appeal at the Dutch court fails, do you have any other options before you have to reduce production further? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think what you're referring to is that this minister went ahead and decided to further curtail production from 24 billion to 21.6 billion cubic meters per year. That doesn't go into effect until the next gas year, which starts in September. I really don't want to get into the discussions that we're having with the government. We certainly understand the issue. There has been a lot of really good collaboration amongst the various parties to make sure that we've got a good understanding, and that will all be addressed in these discussions between the various parties. I'm not going to speculate how that turns out. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No problem. Operator : We'll now go to John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Just two quick ones on Guyana, Jeff. Is Ranger a structural trap or a strat trap? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, John. Ranger, the carbon build, it would likely be structural. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. I was just wondering if you had clastics off lapping on it. Next question, for Liza Phase 1, Hess mentioned that you're only planning eight producers. Is that correct? And should we assume for comparable phases that it will be a low number of wells given relative productivity or expected productivity? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yes, as you heard, we had a really nice test on Liza, and that really sets us up for the development plan. So we do have eight production wells planned from four drill centers, and we'll see how that goes as the development progresses, but that is the current basis going forward. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Great, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, John. Operator : And we'll now go to Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug, if you could, please check your mute function. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry about that. Yes, indeed, sorry for lining up again, Jeff. I just wanted to close the loop on one issue. The deeper Payara tail, Hess gives some color on it, but I guess we're going to get the official version from you. Can you just give what your prognosis was there, whether there are plans to go to a Payara 3 and try that deeper section again, or are you done with that one and moving on? I'll leave it there, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: In terms of the plans, Doug, that's yet to be determined. But yes, we did deep in approximately 300 meters to evaluate a deeper exploration objective. And I'll just note before I share the results that this was a good low-cost opportunity to evaluate what we saw as potentially a material prospect. In terms of what we found, we found high-quality water-bearing sands that oil shows throughout. I think we would characterize the results as being encouraging, both from a reservoir quality and hydrocarbon systems standpoint in the deeper section, and that information will clearly be integrated into our forward assessment. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jeff, do you find people bite to that at a future date with another Payara appraisal and maybe another deepening? Because it sounds like you're not \u2013 I'm trying to read the tea leaves here a little bit. Are you writing the deeper section off completely, or are you saying there's further testing you want to do in that Cenomanian part of the play? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think the results would indicate that clearly we need to integrate that into our overall model of the depositional environment and the potential, and that may lead up to some additional work in those sands of a comparable geologic age. But it's just way too early to comment on specific plans at this point. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right, I'll leave it there. Thank you for taking my follow-up. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: All right, Doug. Operator : And we have time for one final question, and that will come from Guy Baber of Simmons. Guy Baber - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Guy. Guy Baber - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks for fitting me in here. I apologize for revisiting this, but I think it's important, and just trying to understand the messaging on the $25 billion or so medium-term capital spending framework and how sensitive that might be to the oil price environment should we find ourselves in a lower oil price world than you may have anticipated at the time you gave the guidance. And really, I'm just trying to understand that tension between investing sufficiently to sustain, replenish your portfolio, against the willingness to tolerate some cash flow outspend. And really, I just ask because on an organic basis, your spending right now is obviously well below that $25 billion future potential run rate, even allowing for some pretty material activity increases over the back half of this year. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think it's a very good question. A couple thoughts I would share with you is, one, remember our long-term investment program is really founded on our long-term constructive view of energy demand, and we are really trying. For us to compete and win, simply put, is that we have got to be the lowest cost of supply producer out there. And that's really the mindset that we use as we set up these long-cycle investments, okay? So a large part of our investment program that we shared with you all in March at the analyst meeting out through the end of the decade is really is long-cycle investments. Now of course we've got a short-cycle component, and it represents, let's just say round numbers, about a third of our total Upstream spend. And we will look at that, particularly in a near-term low-price environment. We'll look at that to make sure that it makes good sense because one of the things you want to do in the short-cycle program, particularly in things like Permian or the Bakken, is you want to maintain a certain level of activity to continue to grow that learning curve. You don't ever want to drop back on that learning curve. On the same hand, you don't want to over-invest. The last thing we want to do is over-capitalize in unconventional business. So we'll keep a level commensurate with that learning curve benefit. And you saw that over 2015 to 2016. As we dropped rigs, we stayed pretty high in our activity level. So those are some of the tradeoffs we've got. Let's summarize by saying that we've got flexibility. We have always built in flexibility and we tried to share some of that at the analyst meeting with respect to our capital program. But again, I'll just emphasize that the long-cycle program is really based on our constructive view of supply and demand. Guy Baber - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : And this does conclude our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Woodbury for any additional or closing comments. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: To conclude, I just thank everybody once again for your time, very thoughtful questions this morning, a really good exchange of some of the key fundamental elements that drives our value proposition. I do appreciate the preparation. And importantly, we really do appreciate the trust that our investors place in ExxonMobil. So we'll close here, and we look forward to our future discussions. Thank you. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation third quarter 2017 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations & Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide 2. Turning now to slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our third quarter performance. ExxonMobil earned $4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date earnings to $11.3 billion. Earnings rose 50% from the prior-year period, as commodity prices improved and business performance strengthened. All three business segments delivered solid results, generating cash flow from operations and asset sales that exceeded dividends and net investments for the fourth consecutive quarter. These results were achieved as the company worked to safely bring our Gulf Coast manufacturing operations back online following the devastating effects of Hurricane Harvey. In addition, we continued capturing attractive opportunities across the value chain from securing high-potential exploration acreage, to logistics investments, to expanding chemical capacity in growing markets. I'll highlight these items in more detail later. Moving to slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Overall, global economic growth was modest in the quarter. The Eurozone and Japan experienced slower economic expansion along with the U.S., which was negatively impacted by hurricanes. In China, economic expansion remained steady compared to the previous quarter. The commodity price environment was mixed, as crude oil prices increased, but natural gas prices were flat to down. Global rig count increased slightly, driven by higher activity in North America. Refining margins improved with stronger global distillate demand while global chemical commodity margins softened, driven by increases in feed and energy costs. Turning now to the financial results on slide 5. As indicated, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $4 billion or $0.93 per share. In the quarter, the corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx was $6 billion, reflecting increased activity and the completion of the Jurong Aromatics plant acquisition. As previously indicated, this facility provides added value to integration with our existing world-class petrochemical facilities in Singapore, which are well placed to meet growing regional demand. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.4 billion, more than $1 billion higher than the last quarter. Cash totaled $4.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and debt was $40.6 billion, down $1.3 billion from the prior quarter. Next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. So over the quarter, our cash balances increased from $4 billion to $4.3 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $8.4 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Note, this includes a working capital build of approximately $1 billion related to Hurricane Harvey. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $3.4 billion. Debt reduction and other financing items decreased cash by $1.4 billion. In the third quarter, ExxonMobil did not make any share repurchases to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs, and we don't currently plan on making additional purchases to reduce shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide 7 for a review of our segment results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings increased $1.3 billion from a year-ago quarter, driven by stronger Upstream and Downstream results and lower corporate charges from favorable tax items. Although corporate and financing charges have been trending below our guidance range in recent quarters, we expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be toward the high end of the $400 million to $600 million guidance. I'll note that our corporate effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, up from 20% a year ago, reflecting changes in our segment earnings mix and other one-time tax items. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide 8. Third quarter Upstream earnings were $1.6 billion, an increase of nearly $950 million from the prior-year quarter, driven by higher realizations. Crude prices rose nearly $6.50 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter, while the gas realizations increased about $0.60 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $20 million. All other items increased earnings $70 million, driven by lower operating expenses, which were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $4.53 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Moving to slide 9, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day, an increase of nearly 2% compared to the third quarter of 2016. Liquids production was up 69,000 barrels per day. Favorable volume impacts from projects, work programs and reduced downtime were partly offset by field decline and lower entitlements. Natural gas production decreased 16 million cubic feet per day, as project and work program volumes were more than offset by fuel decline, lower demand and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands. Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results on slide 10. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.5 billion, up $300 million compared to the third quarter of 2016. Stronger refining margins, primarily distillate and gasoline, increased earnings by $1 billion. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $160 million, mainly due to lower throughput from Hurricane Harvey, partly offset by improved operations. All other items reduced earnings by $550 million, reflecting the absence of favorable asset management gains of $380 million related to the sale of Canadian retail assets in the third quarter of 2016, as well as expenses related to the hurricane. Now, moving to Chemical financial and operating results on slide 11. Third quarter Chemical earnings were $1.1 billion, down $79 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker commodity margins, driven by increased feed and energy costs, decreased earnings by $200 million. Higher product sales, driven by increased demand, new capacity and improved operations, increased earnings by $120 million. All other items in the quarter included costs associated with Hurricane Harvey and expenses from new production units in Saudi Arabia and Singapore, offset in part by favorable foreign exchange effects. Moving now to slide 12 for an update on our hurricane recovery efforts, Hurricane Harvey had devastating impacts for many of our employees, contractors, and the communities in which we live and operate. Nonetheless, our highly dedicated people and effective operations integrity systems permitted a safe shutdown of our refining and chemical operations in Baytown, Mont Belvieu, and Beaumont. Because of advanced planning and preparation, we were able to protect the infrastructure of our manufacturing plants, and we're well positioned to resume operations in a timely fashion. Refining and chemical operations at these sites are now back to normal. Following the storm, we worked closely with our partners and customers who sell our branded products to maximize fuel supplies to consumers and emergency responders. We acted quickly to bring in gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel from other regions in the U.S. and abroad to supplement our production, ensuring the return of reliable supply to our customers. Our Upstream operations fortunately experienced limited impacts, with some offshore platforms temporarily shut in. Overall, Hurricane Harvey had an estimated unfavorable impact on third quarter earnings of $160 million and a debit of $0.04 per share. ExxonMobil employees continue to dedicate their time and resources to support the communities impacted by the storm, and we are proud of our employees who provided hands-on assistance with flood relief, and we continue to support them in their efforts. Moving to slide 13, we're making good progress on further strengthening our portfolio in South America with high-potential opportunities. First, in Guyana, we announced our fifth offshore discovery with the successful Turbot well. The well encountered 75 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, and is located approximately 30 miles to the southeast of the Liza Phase 1 project. Evaluation of the discovery is underway. Importantly, this success proves a new play and helps to derisk multiple plays in the Turbot area. We plan to drill an additional well in the new year to help delineate this discovery. The rig is now moving to the Ranger prospect, which is another new play test on the Stabroek Block. In Brazil, we are pleased to have secured an attractive offshore acreage position, winning 10 blocks in the September bid round and completing a farm-in on two additional blocks. Each of these blocks is under a concession contract. In the highly prospective outer Campos pre-salt, ExxonMobil was jointly awarded six blocks with Petrobras. Each partner holds 50% working interest, with Petrobras as the operator. ExxonMobil was also awarded an additional two blocks in the Northern Campos Basin with 100% working interest. In the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, ExxonMobil recently farmed in with Murphy on two blocks held by QGEP. We then jointly bid with this co-venture group, and we were awarded two additional blocks in the same basin. For all four of these blocks, ExxonMobil will operate and hold a 50% working interest. The 12 blocks combined offer promising deepwater exploration potential. The Campos Basin blocks are an extension of the pre-salt play where multiple world-class discoveries have been made. We have identified multibillion-barrel prospects on our own existing high-quality seismic data over these blocks and look forward to working with the government and our partners to progress exploration plans. We anticipate commencing exploration activities in 2018 with 3D seismic acquisition and then drilling in 2019. Turning now to slide 14 for an update on our efforts to further enhance business integration for our growing attractive resources in the Permian Basin to our Gulf Coast manufacturing hubs. As you know, we continue to expand our acreage position in the Permian using strategic trades and acquisitions. Since the Delaware acquisition in the first quarter of this year, ExxonMobil has executed another five acreage transactions, adding a combined total of 22,000 operated acres for an implied cost of about $20,000 per acre. This acreage is contiguous to our core positions, making it ideal for capital-efficient development using long lateral wells, and adds more than 400 million oil equivalent barrels of low-cost resources. We're also expanding logistics access and flexibility to capture value from wellhead to premium fuels and chemical products. Earlier this year, we completed the formation of the Permian Express Partners pipeline joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners. In addition, in July, we concluded an agreement with Summit Midstream Partners to create a new natural gas gathering and processing system, servicing production from our acreage. Earlier this month, we further enhanced our logistics capabilities with the acquisition of a crude oil terminal in Wink, Texas from Genesis Energy. This acquisition marks ExxonMobil's first terminal in the Permian Basin to be anchored by the company's recently acquired Delaware acreage. The terminal is strategically positioned to handle Permian crude oil and condensate for transport to Gulf Coast refineries and marine export terminals. The facility is interconnected to the Plains Alpha Crude Connector pipeline system and is permitted for 100,000 barrels per day of throughput, with the ability to expand. The terminal provides crude producers with a full range of logistical options, including truck, rail, and inbound and outbound pipeline access, establishing ExxonMobil as a key midstream provider in the rapidly growing Permian Basin. These logistics investments support ongoing manufacturing investments to increase feed processing flexibility and capacity for higher-value products in our Downstream and Chemical businesses. Our leading presence in the Permian, from equity production through to Gulf Coast refining and chemical capacity, positions us for world-class development across the value chain. Moving to slide 15, the graph on the right shows our progress to date compared to the unconventional liquids volumes forecast we provided at our Analyst Day in March. Our total unconventional production from the Delaware, Midland, and Bakken basins is now over 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. We are currently operating 20 rigs in the Permian and will continue to ramp up to approximately 30 operated rigs by year-end 2018. We are leveraging our contiguous acreage position to drill long-lateral wells, targeting industry-leading unit development costs. The wells drilled in the Midland this year average about 10,000 lateral feet, well above the industry average. We continue to work with our dedicated innovation and technology team to improve our efficiency. We told you last quarter about drilling our first 12,500-foot lateral well in the Delaware, and this well was just brought on production. By leveraging our learnings in the Bakken, where we recently fractured the first of several 3-mile laterals, we will start drilling our first 3-mile lateral in the Permian before year end. ExxonMobil's best-in-class operational expertise allows for more efficient drilling and completions, which in turn enables us to enhance value through our operated investments. We'll continue to incorporate learnings to lower unit costs as we grow our unconventional liquids at a 20% compounded annual growth rate through 2025, underpinned by near-term annual growth in the Permian at about 45%. Turning now to slide 16, the summary of the corporation's year-to-date sources and uses of cash highlights the solid performance of our business segments, which enables the company to meet its commitments to our shareholders. As shown, year-to-date 2017 cash flow from operations and asset sales of $24.4 billion funded shareholder distributions, net investments in the business, and a reduction in debt. In addition, we continue to generate free cash flow while selectively investing in the business and maintaining capital discipline. This quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter where free cash flow has exceeded distributions to our shareholders since the significant drop in oil prices. Moving now to the final slide, I'll conclude today's presentation with a summary of our year-to-date performance. Simply put, we continue to remain focused on long-term value growth. Our integrated business has grown cash flow from operations and asset sales to over $20 billion, an increase of over 40% compared to the first nine months of 2016. Our business segments have collectively earned over $11 billion, an increase of over $5 billion compared to the first nine months last year. Upstream production volumes are within our guidance range at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. We continue investing in and capturing new high-quality opportunities across the value chain, but remain disciplined in capital allocation while delivering best-in-class execution. This has resulted in total capital expenditures year-to-date of $14.1 billion. Finally, our year-to-date free cash flow of $13.5 billion more than covered our reliable and growing shareholder distributions of $9.7 billion. In short, we remain confident that our integrated business is well positioned to continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and we'll now open it up to your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. And we will first go to Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, Jeff, the capital expenditure year-to-date continues to look quite right relative to your guidance. So I wonder if you could just speak to if whether you really expect a catch-up at the back-end of the year and also maybe the $25 billion indication you gave for 2018. I guess what's at the back of my mind is that the Permian is a very low-cost offset to whatever you think the portfolio decline is. And it seems to us your CapEx flexibility is a lot better than perhaps your guidance suggests? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Doug, as you said, our year-to-date expenditures on CapEx is trending lower at this point, but we still have our guidance at $22 billion. You may recall that our objective is to go ahead and close the transaction for the Mozambique Area 4 acreage before year end, and that's still the plan, and that was about $2.8 billion. At the same time, we have also ramped up some activity in our unconventional business. And, of course, we've got the Brazil transactions that we just consummated. And all of that really leads us to the view that the guidance is appropriate. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : To be honest, I didn't \u2013 go on, go on, I'm sorry. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Looking forward into 2018 and thereafter, of course, we'll go ahead and provide an update before 2018 gets there. But our plan is still \u2013 and I wouldn't assume that our CapEx is linear over that timeframe. And I think we showed $70 billion to $80 billion over 2018 to 2020. But it is going to be in the general ballpark of about $25 billion plus or minus. But like I said, we'll go ahead and provide an update here early next year. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So I didn't mean to interrupt you, Jeff. But just to be clear, first of all, I didn't realize that Mozambique had not yet closed, so that explains it perhaps. But the $25 billion number next year also include acquisitions? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, Doug, we tend to leave a little flexibility in the budget to pursue opportunities that come up. But we'll give you \u2013 if there's something that we believe is fairly close and certain, we typically would include it. But if it's not at a point where we believe it's going to close, we typically do not. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. My follow-up is \u2013 I'm not going to be too predictable here, but is Guyana, your comments on Turbot. I guess my understanding is the rig stayed on location several weeks after you disclosed the result. One wouldn't expect you to do that on a small discovery. So I wondered if you could speak to what you're thinking in terms scale of the greater Turbot area. And maybe an update on how you're thinking about the coincident timing of multiple phases in Liza, Payara? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, sure. Well, again, as you would expect that we are very pleased with the Turbot discovery. We do plan \u2013 as I may have indicated previously, we do a plan going back and drill a follow-up well in 2018. The important message on Turbot is that it did confirm a new play, different depositional environment, and there's still a lot of work to be done. It's early days in order to assess it, but there were a number of follow-up plays in this area that allows us to go ahead and better define and potentially go ahead and assess. As you go forward, to your second question about the subsequent developments, what I would tell you is that obviously, we're very encouraged by the results in Guyana. We had previously given you a range of about 2.3 million to 2.8 million barrels of recoverable resource. Obviously, the Turbot results puts us towards the higher end of that. And we will certainly, as we better define Turbot, we will certainly refine our resource range. But given those results, we have had active development planning for subsequent phases and progress. I would say given the significant exploration success to date that we are considering at least two more phases, Phase 2 and Phase 3, for Guyana. And we are also considering higher processing capacity for the ships. Now, of course, as we continue our parallel exploration program, that will be integrated into our development planning efforts, and things may change. But very positive progress and certainly a very important component of our portfolio going forward. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, Jeff, I'll leave it there. But I just wondered if you would give us some idea as to when you would expect to FID the subsequent phases. And I'll really leave it there. Sorry for the extended question. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I really don't have \u2013 I certainly appreciate the interest, Doug, and I really don't have a timeline at this point. We're looking at all the various options, but given the progress we made, I mean, you can appreciate with the Phase 1 development, that was a best-in-class five year from discovery to startup, and the extent that we can continue to capture the, if you will, Design One Build Many concept, we want to keep on a fairly good pace going forward. Okay? Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we'll now go to Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Around this time of the year, companies often reassess strategy and pay incentives to reflect changes in competitive and corporate governance environments. And on this point, ExxonMobil has historically emphasized returns on capital employed and free cash flow and shareholder distributions, and these metrics have very strong correlations to total shareholder return, which is obviously a good thing, especially in relation to some of the growth metrics. Simultaneously, ExxonMobil's stock is flat versus a decade ago and relative performance versus energy peers is mixed. And so that begs the question whether a change in the mix or weightings of incentives is needed or whether a more challenging peer group, which might include S&P 500, as a peer has done, might be beneficial to shareholders, too. So can you comment, Jeff, on how the company thinks about these issues given the performance of the stock over the past decade? And how important this topic is internally in the grand scheme of things? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Doug, as we've talked in the past, I'll just reinforce to the broader group that it is very important. And the fundamental principle for our executive compensation structure is to tie a large component of the compensation to the same performance that our shareholders will experience. So we have one of, if not the longest, incentive programs in terms of vesting. And the -again, the \u2013 that whole ultimate compensation is driven by how the stock will ultimately do. As you know, we are in a business that has very long cycle times on returns because of the magnitude of the investment. And we want to make sure that we hold our executives to the decisions that they made over a long period of time. So we have a very large part of the compensation that is performance-based, that is tied directly to the share's performance. As you said, there are other parameters that the board considers, and return on capital employed and safety performance are two of the seven key criteria. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. No, you definitely seem to be using the right metric, so I just wonder if the weightings could be reset or what have you. But anyway, so \u2013 I also have one other question, Jeff. You guys announced a pretty meaningful asset sale, if I read this correctly. Can you talk about how it affected the published earnings number of $0.93 per share in the quarter? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: The \u2013 you mean the overall asset proceeds of... Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Yes. Was there any gains and losses we should know about that were meaningful? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. So, overall, from an earnings impact, it was actually a quarter-on-quarter decrease. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: A quarter-to-quarter decrease on earnings by about 300 \u2013 just over $300 million. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: On the overall proceeds, in the release, it was about $850 million. And a lot of that in the third quarter was really associated with the receivable that we had due in Papua New Guinea. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, absolutely. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay? Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, Jeff. Thanks a lot. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: All right. Thank you, Doug. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Maybe another strategic question to start. Peak oil demand driven by (32:59) penetration has increasingly captivated investor attention, and it does represent a medium to longer-term challenge. I know that you expect on your macro work to see demand growth for decades yet. Has the risk of peak oil demand altered in any way, or how is that considered in your gating process for both Upstream and Downstream projects, especially given the depth in your portfolio? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Evan, this is a very important question and one that probably can take a lot of time to describe. But for us, it really starts with the annual update of our energy outlook. That is fundamental to providing us the insights around our business strategy and our investment planning. If I very quickly summarize that oil demand is primarily driven by three components : light-duty vehicle consumption, heavy-duty consumption and petrochemicals. And what's really driving that growth are the latter two : petrochemicals and heavy-duty consumption. Right now, there's not a sufficient alternative to replace those energy sources because of the energy intensity requirements. Now our energy outlook assumes on light-duty vehicles that we will reach a peak in gasoline demand and come down, and that's driven by two things. It's driven by efficiency of ICE, of internal combustion engines, as well as greater hybrid and EV penetration into the marketplace. So the bottom result of all this is, is that we do look at variations in the peak or in the EV penetration. And if you look at our forecast right now, we have by 2040 the fleet is about 6% EV. If you were to increase that by 50%, that would have a liquids demand impact of about 0.5 million barrels per day. So not substantial when you think about overall oil demand of over 100 million barrels per day at that point, but certainly, something that we keep a very close look at as we think about our research and development activities, as well as building the strategy. And then a key element of what we have been doing in this area is, and you've heard us talk about it, is how we are making strategic investments today in order to upgrade those gasoline molecules into higher-value products, like distillates and lubricants. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate the color. Second one on the U.S. onshore bases. Exxon is one of the fastest accelerators here, growth you've gone from 16 to 25 rigs and four in the Permian just since mid-year, and your plan is here to add another 10 by 2018. I guess, particularly as it relates to the Permian, are you seeing any deterioration in equipment or completion crew quality that is being highlighted by some smaller operators? And are you able to fully mitigate or offset some of those pressures given your global sourcing advantage? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. No, that's a good question because any time you come off a very low cycle like we've just been through, you have to be very mindful of the crew qualifications and the equipment capability. But remember, Evan, that even in that low cycle, we maintained a fairly active rig program in the onshore U.S., and that is because we want to maintain that learning curve benefit and we want to make sure that we are taking full advantage of the market at that point. So therefore, as we ramp up, we've got a very strong fleet of service providers. As we add additional rigs, clearly, the partnership that we've got with our service providers, they understand what the minimum standards are because what you want to avoid is all that rework associated with execution, shortfalls in quality \u2013 shortfalls in quality performance. But we have not \u2013 there is nothing material that I would point to at this stage, but it's something that you've got to watch very carefully as you go into a ramp-up phase, especially in areas where there's a lot of activity. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Phil Gresh from JPMorgan. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi, good morning, Jeff. Just first question, I just want to clarify the comment on the asset sale gains in earnings. You mentioned that quarter-over-quarter, but could you give us the absolute number? I know Downstream \u2013 we didn't have the gains from last quarter, but what was the absolute Upstream gain? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: And you're asking for in the quarter or quarter-on-quarter? Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In the quarter on an absolute basis. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: The absolute gain was almost $80 million in the quarter, and most of that was in the Upstream. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Second question is on the CapEx that was asked about before looking towards the longer term. You were talking about $25 billion plus or minus in a given year. And I think when I asked about this last quarter, you did seem to suggest maybe it'd be a bit more of a linear path lower and then kind of ramping in the out years. Is that still how you think about it, or will 2018 be more in that $25 billion plus or minus? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Phil, I think it's probably best to wait until we get to the next phase of communication around our forward investment plans. I mean, it's going to be in the \u2013 where we are in 2017 to around that ballpark. But as you know, we picked up a number of very attractive new assets that we're going to get after right away. And that needs to be integrated into our forward investment plans. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Got it. And then you made a comment that you will not be doing buybacks to offset dilution. I think in the third quarter \u2013 I mean, it tends to be lumpy it appears, maybe if you can just comment on that and the decision not to do that. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. So there's two components. One is the purchase of shares to offset dilution for our benefits plans and programs, and that is lumpy. That happens usually I believe in the first quarter timeframe. The second component of that is our buyback program. And as we've talked previously in capital allocation, the way we think about it from our sources of funds, the first things that are being funded are our dividends and our investment program. And if there's any cash left at that point given that the corporation does not want to hold large cash reserves, it's at that point that we will look for what the next best thing is. And maybe if we have some debt maturing, we'll pay that debt down. But on a quarterly basis, we'll make a decision on whether we go ahead and buy back some shares. And I'll say, Phil, that decision is a function of number of factors. One being the current financial position of the corporation, as I said, both our CapEx and dividend requirements, as well as what we see in the near term in terms of the business outlook, but it's a decision that ultimately is made on a quarterly basis. Phil M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. I will leave it there. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Roger. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : If we could come back to the Permian, the comment about 10,000-foot average laterals now going to 12,500 or at 12,500 and then the idea of 15,000, can you give us an idea of maybe what you've done pilot-wise to this point that gives you confidence that's the right direction to go just because as you go longer laterals, more things can go wrong, and since you do have the acreage, maybe an idea of the performance you're seeing out of those longer wells relative to, say, 10,000 or less? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It's a good question, and you're really honing in on a key element of our overall strategy. I'll start with it's probably becoming much clearer to the group what the value chain strategy that we've put in place for the Permian. We've built up a very large contiguous acreage position that really allows us to leverage the strength of our technology capability. For us, I'll be real clear. It's not about just how we execute. It's all about how do we extend best-in-class performance. Clearly, what we're trying to do is leverage our full technological capability to go ahead and achieve the lowest unit cost and then capturing the highest value from the barrels through the full value chain, ultimately to the customer. Okay? So what have we done is we have recently drilled several wells in the Bakken on 3-mile laterals. The first one has been completed now. These are very long wells. We want to make sure that we get good inflow performance across the full lateral length. We drilled the first well in Delaware at 12,500 feet, and that well is just coming on right now. And we're getting ready to drill a 3-mile lateral in the Permian as well. And we've got a very focused research effort on this from the reservoir all the way to the hardware, and we're really looking at how do we make a step change in the ultimate development here. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, back to the earlier question on CapEx, if we make the adjustment for the \u2013 let's just assume the Permian acreage was the big change Q2 to Q3, it implies that your overall CapEx was fairly stable Q2 to Q3. And then you have the Mozambique in front of you. Is there any other \u2013 other than the comments about higher drilling in the Lower 48, anything else that we should think about that steps up as we go into year end the first part of 2018? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Let me just correct you. On the increase in the third quarter, that was primarily driven by closing the acquisition for Jurong Aromatics. Okay? Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm sorry. I was talking Upstream CapEx only. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Oh. Okay. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So $2.8 billion went to roughly $3.2 billion, and the math works out that that's the Permian. Obviously, you've got plenty of things moving around, but I was just trying to understand. If that is the case, then the step-up, even if we adjust for Mozambique, still has to be fairly significant in the latter part of this year. And then I was just wondering what else was going on as we walk our way into 2018 other than an increase in Lower 48 activity? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Probably the biggest piece is the increase in the Lower 48 drilling, predominantly in the unconventional. I'll just remind you, we also have four major projects underway that a couple of them are getting close to a startup stage, so it's primarily project spending, it's the ramp-up on unconventional, and then our base work program in the Upstream. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Sam Margolin from Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: I'd like to get your assessment of the LNG market right now, considering it ties back to a couple of the acquisitions you made over the past year-plus. And you did mention that some of the capital ramp is going into those new assets. The market has been really quiet over the course of all of 2017, not a lot of new FID activity or reports of buyers really looking to accelerate commitments. And I wonder how much of that is due to the wall of supply that's coming on between now and 2018? And if you think that can pick up as the second half of next year emerges, or if this quiet period might last a little bit longer and how that might affect some of your timing around those new big global gas assets you have? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Sam, again, I'd start with our energy outlook, where we've got gas growing from 2015 to 2040 at about 1.5% per year. And a pretty sizable component is our LNG business, and that's growing probably about 2.5 times over that timeframe. Now, just like any type of commodity, we're going to have periods of oversupply and periods where there will be insufficient supply. And I think everybody's well aware there's a number of projects that have come on that are ramping up. Others will be starting up, and that's likely to provide a period where we'll have oversupply to, say, the mid-2020s. But as we think about the very large, very diverse portfolio we have that potentially could be LNG projects, we're moving all of them forward at the pace consistent with where the project is in its maturation timeline. And the objective is to move all of them into a final investment decision. But we recognize they're not all going to go at that same pace. The key here, the very important message here is, we've got to be on the far left side of the cost of supply curve. We have got to be the most cost competitive out there in the market in order to attract that demand growth that I was talking about. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And I guess \u2013 so the follow-up then, I guess, because this hasn't been apparent, by the way. The market has progressed over the past year or so. Do you think that there will be opportunities for you to get commitments from buyers at the scale that you might need to FID some of these project, even if the market at that time is oversupplied? Are you seeing from your customers a look out into that post-2022 timeframe when the market is more balanced and they can sign up commitments out in the future, or do they need to see more near-term evidence of tightness before they move? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think it's a mix of both. I think the buyers are looking far out. Obviously, they need that supply. They need to make sure that they are well positioned from their standpoint to competitively capture that supply. I would just remind everybody that we have underpinned our past LNG project funding decisions with long-term firm contracts. And we all know that the market continues to evolve, adding more flexibility in commercial terms on shorter durations. So while our objective remains to secure commercial certainty to underpin these large funding decisions, it's more likely that projects in the near future were based on a hybrid of sales, although that doesn't diminish our interest in locking in long-term firm contracts. Sam Margolin - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right, thank you so much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks, Sam. Operator : And we'll now go to Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Jeff. There's a little bit more Permian disclosure that's being referenced. When I look at the data that you've given here, you added 22,000 operated acres, more than 400 million oil equivalent barrels. So would I be mistaken in assuming that you spent about $400 million in the quarter based on the statement that you paid about $1 an oil equivalent barrel? And would I be even more mistaken if I said that that was about $18,000 an acre, or is that pretty much inferenced? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: That's an implied cost. And the reason I say that, Paul, is because the five transactions we're talking about were both cash and trades. So there were a number of non-cash trades that were in there as well. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, all right. That's fine. And then it's interesting that you're talking about these much longer laterals, the 10,000 feet. And then you're saying that you're going to be drilling a 3-mile lateral in the Permian, but you've actually just completed one in the Bakken. I think that's what I heard, correct? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: That's right. We actually drilled \u2013 I think it's four in the Bakken, and we've completed the first one. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great, thank you. And then if I look at the slide, and this is obviously slide 15, the implication of the very impressive growth forecast that you have is that you have all the acreage you need more or less to achieve the very aggressive volume growth that you're going for insofar as you identify the acreage that's going to provide that. Again, is that too much inference, or is that a fair sort of... Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No, Paul, that's a good clarification. The volume that we have on slide 15 is really based on existing acreage that we have. Now, as I said in my prepared comments, one of the things that we're doing in a lot of our transactions is a build on \u2013 they bolt on to existing acreage that we have. So directionally, I can share that one of the strategies is to continue to grow that contiguous acreage. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot. And then Jurong was reported in the press to be a $1.7 billion sale. I think that's public information. Is that about the number? I'm trying to get obviously to the clean underlying CapEx. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Paul, unfortunately, we're bound by a confidentiality agreement on that with the sellers. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood, Jeff. And then the last one for me was that you did mention that you've been trending lower in corporate and other expenses, but there will be a bounce in Q4. I just wondered what that was about. It's bit of an arcane question for you, but thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: As you know, corporate finance costs have a lot of variables in them. But I would say that probably the largest part of it, Paul, will be the absence of some of the favorable items that we're seeing in this quarter. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Fair enough, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Jeff, maybe just a couple quick ones. In the Permian disclosure that you have there, you talk about the planned increase from 20 Permian rigs to 30 by year-end 2018. Is the assumed pace of activity growth the same as what was implied in the 2017 Analyst Day earlier this year? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I would tell you that it's picking up a bit. And I will just \u2013 just make sure I want to clarify for everybody that these are operated rigs. This does not include non-operated rigs that we participated in. But the volumes itself is our total net production. The \u2013 but the rig counts \u2013 I mean, it's comparable to what we had originally planned when we detailed out the basis for the acquisition, and that's what we shared with you in the March Analyst. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And how do you think \u2013 when you look at over that multi-year period, how much does commodity price figure into that? I mean, you tend to kind of \u2013 I know you are executing the long-term plan, which is based on value creation. But as you think about potential upside and downside risk to that plan going forward, how much does the commodity figure in versus if you think of things like efficiency gains and cost inflation or inflation? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Certainly it's a factor, but we're working on both sides of that equation. We're not only working on the realization being mindful of it as we do the economics, but we're also working on the overall capital invested and operating costs driving that cost basis down. And you may recall in an earlier call, we provided a snapshot \u2013 I think it was in the Analyst Meeting, a snapshot of the economic resiliency of the existing portfolio. And at $40 flat rail, which is a reasonable lower end here, we had over 5,500 wells in the Permian and the Bakken that generated at least a 10% rate of return. And a large part of them \u2013 let's say about a third of them generated actually better than a 30% rate of return. So very good economic resiliency, but don't think of that as being static because we continue to work on dropping that cost. And you remember, last quarter I was sharing with you all that while our average unit development cost is $7 per oil equivalent barrel, we are trying to push that down further to \u2013 as far down as $5 per barrel. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great. Thanks. And then maybe just one on Brazil. I appreciate the disclosure you have in the slides on Brazil. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your thoughts on the acreages that you've acquired, and how it would compare possibly to the upcoming pre-salt round, which I think is going on today in blocks, which I think you're potentially involved in? And then maybe what are your requirements from a drilling and seismic point of view over the next few years and how it more broadly fits into your global exploration portfolio? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: As you probably pick up from my prepared comments, we're very excited about the acreage position that we have. In fact, the bid round that's going on right now, I guess it's been announced now that ExxonMobil won the high bid on North Carcara as well. So this has really allowed us to get into a very prolific basin that we've been looking at for some time. You're all very much aware that this is all about value for us, and we've been very mindful of making sure that while it's got a very strong resource endowment, we needed to do it on the terms that it was competitive with our existing inventory, and we're very pleased with that. So, obviously, when you think about how we high-grade the portfolio, it's all about through our acquisitions and our exploration program, bringing in resources that go to the very top of the portfolio and then through our divestment program, monetizing the resources at the very bottom. And our full intent, as I said in my prepared comments, to get right after the Brazil acreage, we've got some really strong partners that we'll be working with. Well, we've already got some seismic \u2013 as I said in the prepared comments that we have some good sense of what's out there we're going to get right out to in 2018 3D seismic and then shortly thereafter, drilling. So very pleased with where we are. The potential that we've got and yet another high-quality deepwater resource that we'll bring our expertise to. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alastair Syme from Citi. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Good morning, Jeff. It's a topic that you mentioned, the Brazil award that has just been announced. I'm going to guess Exxon shifted a lot of the deepwater focus in recent years from West Africa to South America. Do you think the focus on the other side of the Atlantic margin is geological based or regulatory or really a combination of both? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I mean, we keep a very broad brief of where there is high-value potential in the various basins. And really when you think about how we have structured our exploration program, it's primarily focusing in two areas. One being a focused exploration program on high-quality resources where we have existing operations that we can quickly leverage to get those discoveries on production in a very fast timeframe. And then the second area is new big, high-value potential that's play-opening. In Brazil, very strong geology, the government has evolved the fiscal basis and it's got good fiscal \u2013 competitive fiscal terms. So that's where \u2013 how we are focusing it on \u2013 on the exploration program. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: My follow-up, Jeff, on the offshore is we're seeing a lot of deflation, and some of the recently awarded rig contracts have been getting pretty low. Are we at the stage yet that ExxonMobil is getting concerned about the financial viability of the supply chain that you see? And if so, what are you trying to do about it? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I think you do address an issue that this industry has had to deal with over the cycles. When you get into low period, as I referenced earlier, the service sector starts getting down to their cost structure and we have got to find \u2013 continue to find those win-win solutions that allow the producer to achieve an attractive return, and at the same time keep the service sector healthy. One of the areas that I think ExxonMobil contributes is, we develop very long effective relationships with our supplier sector. And they fully understand that \u2013 the amount of activity that we can provide is a function of the value they add to the investment decisions. They have a tremendous amount of capability and innovative concepts that they have brought to collaborate with us in terms of providing new solutions for some of the more challenging resources. And I think we have a mutual objective here, and I think most of the service sectors understand that as well. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Okay, thank you very much. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks, Alastair. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Good morning. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Simple really quick clarification. Earlier in your presentation when you were looking at the Permian expected growth, say, up to 500,000 \u2013 600,000-barrel per day production by year 2025, is that based on the rig program at 30 by the end of next year and then steady, or whether that's based on a continuing incremental growth in the rig program? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It's really the latter. We would see some further growth in the rig program. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And at this point, that is too early for you to comment on what is the growth rate of the rigs that you may have in mind? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No, and really it's an interesting question because remember, these rigs are getting much, much more productive and how we drill these wells are getting much \u2013 much more efficient. I mean, I would expect over this timeframe that we will see much greater efficiency as we continue to progress this development as we have historically. I mean, if you look the rig counts right now in the Lower 48, while they're down more than 50%, that's not an equivalent reduction in overall activity because these rigs are much, much more productive today than they were back at the peak periods. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Second question, that in the press release and you also mentioned the half year impact is $160 million. Just want to clarify, is that represent only the cost associated for the repair or this is also include the lost opportunity costs? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. It includes two components. It includes the expenses as well as the lost volume. So that $160 million as we had in the press release and as I talked about previously equates to about a $0.04 per share hit. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And on Turbot, the mix \u2013 where are you going to drill next year, is that a place or to the Turbot discovery itself, or are you just going to test on the good (01:04:12) Turbot area other structures? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It will \u2013 on the existing resource, it will be a delineation of the existing resource, there's some \u2013 anytime you drill \u2013 remember this is a large area with a very small wellbore that's gone through it. These are generally stratigraphic traps. And it's about making sure that we test these multiple traps that we've seen in these accumulations. So it's going to have several objectives as we go forward. And then, of course, there in the general Turbot area, there are several other prospects that given now we have now proven the play, we need to go ahead and integrate those learnings into our forward rig schedule. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And final one. The 22,000 net acre, the five transaction that you did, you mentioned there's about $20,000, so that's roughly about $440 million. So should we assume that the increase in \u2013 from the second to third quarter in the U. S. CapEx is all related to this because I mean if you back out $440 million, it actually \u2013 well, it means that CapEx in U.S. actually slightly down sequentially? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No, actually that's not the case, Paul, because as I responded to Paul Sankey earlier, that is a combination of both cash as well as trades that we made. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see, okay. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Because there were some non-cash transactions there. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But you still have a net increase of 22,000, right, or that the 22,000 is the final transaction, which is not a net increase? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: That's a net increase of 22,000 in the Permian. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. So it is a net increase even now that you have the trade, you're still \u2013 no, but that's fine. We can get you off-line. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Don't think that the trade is \u2013 involved is just Permian assets. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understand, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Operator : And we'll now move to Blake Fernandez from Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, Jeff. Good morning. It's late in the hour, so I'll just keep it to one question. I wanted to just shift gears a bit to our European gas, last quarter that came off pretty dramatically and it looks like it's remained depressed. I don't know if you could just help us kind of ways to think about modeling that going forward. I know seasonally you would typically have an uptick into 4Q, but any thoughts on that potentially returning at some point to next year or so? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, there really are two components on the European gas. Obviously, as you already pointed out, seasonal demand impacts which would turn around in the fourth quarter or start to turnaround in the fourth quarter. And then the second, it was about \u2013 I'm thinking it was about a 90 million cubic feet a day impact associated with the regulatory cap on the Netherlands, as well I think, Blake, there was some downtime in the UK. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: And just so I'm clear on that 90 million a day, is there any outlook on that potentially changing into the future? Or should we just view that as pretty much out of the volume mix going forward? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, we are in \u2013 or NAM is in active discussion with the government. I really can't speculate on how that will play itself out over time. Blake Fernandez - Scotia Capital (USA), Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Operator : And we'll now go to Jason Gammel from Jefferies. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Well, thanks. I just wanted to come back to the point that you're making about enhancing Permian across the integrated value chain. Obviously, you've been building a big Upstream position and already have the Downstream position on the Gulf Coast. Can you talk about appetite for owning midstream assets? And I guess to put them in the context of the terminal acquisition at Wink. What would you consider strategic that you would want to own with obviously your low cost of capital, and what are you willing to contract out? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Jason, thanks for highlighting that because that's really the key message that we wanted to convey as it relates to our Permian. It's just not a pure Permian play, it's the full value chain from resource all the way to molecules to the customers, whether it would be refined products or chemical products. And as you heard in my prepared comments, one of the things that we're looking and we continue to look at is, where is the value leakage across that value chain, and do we add value in that? And if we do, that's what will play into our strategy and how we capture incremental assets along that value chain. On the Permian, we've got a very strong Gulf Coast manufacturing facilities. We have a very strong Permian resource position, we pick up these flexibility in a logistic system through the pipeline transactions that we've made. We've now got this oil terminal. It gives us control and value capture. We will continue \u2013 like we do in all of our assets, by the way, we'll continue to look at how can you further strengthen that value chain proposition that we or our shareholders are capturing a majority of the value there. Now, there may be some things along that value chain that we just don't add value to, and we're okay with someone else providing that missing piece in the value chain and getting value for it. But I think you get a better line of sight of what we're doing in terms of our value chain management. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay, thanks a lot, Jeff. And just the second one, if I could, please. Now that the Jurong transaction has been completed, can you give us some idea of how to think about the incremental profitability from the Chemical business? And I know we've got the PX volume and we can take that times margin, but can you just talk about some of the synergistic benefits that you get from that transaction when you combine it with your existing Singapore assets? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I think probably the best guidance we've got from me for a quantification is what you just said in terms of the additional aromatics that we are picking up from it. And remember, there's still about \u2013 it's about 65,000 barrels a day of fuel coming from that facility as well. But, of course, the value proposition for us was not only the added value we will get from what the market currently values the asset from because of the unique contributions we think we bring to it, but also the synergies between the Jurong Aromatics site and our big Singapore manufacturing facilities. Probably the biggest part of that is logistics, leveraging the logistics capability of that site for the full integrated site, but we have not put numbers out there externally on that. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay. I guess I'll just make some guesses then. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets has our next question. Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two. First one is on Mozambique, could you just talk through the steps from now until closing and any significant things you need to close it by year-end, and if there's any risk to that slipping into 2018? And the second one is just on the Carcara acquisition that was announced just now. In the press release, from one of your peers, there were some contingent payments. I was wondering if you could just detail whether these are just related to the oil price or anything else that you can highlight. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. On the first one, on Mozambique, I mean, it's really simple in that we need to get a number of approvals and we are still waiting for those approvals. As to the possibility that it's spilling into 2018, there's always a possibility. But our objective right now, Biraj, is to go ahead and conclude this, this year. On Carcara, I'm not sure I know what you're really referring to. I'm going to have to punt on this one because I'm not sure what you're referring to. Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets : Just the press release from Statoil says they'll get $800 million from you guys and then a contingent payment of $500 million. So I was wondering what that $500 million was contingent on. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Yeah. Biraj, I don't \u2013 we're bound under the confidentiality agreement. I really can't talk about the commercial terms. Biraj Borkhataria - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. No worries. Thank you very much. Operator : Theepan Jothilingam from Exane BNP has our next question. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas : Good morning, Jeff, just a couple of questions. Firstly, you have been very active in the asset market in Mozambique and Brazil. I was just wondering how you see some of the potential offset by being a bit more active on the disposal side, particularly given some firming of prices there? That's my first question, actually. Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Theepan, a key element of our asset management program, as I said earlier, is to go ahead and monetize those assets on the bottom of the portfolio, importantly where others see value that is incremental above what we expect that we can capture from the continuing operation. We are always considering whether we can go ahead and complete that type of a transaction. So if you look at, for instance, the last five years, our total proceeds from asset sales were over $20 billion. So as I've said before, anywhere from $2 billion to $4 billion a year, we've historically went ahead and sold. But it is very focused on making sure that we're getting the most value from each one of our assets. And if we get the right value proposition, we'll go ahead and pursue it. But it is a key element of our ongoing asset management to the various business lines. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas : Great. And then the second question I had was \u2013 and I come back to the recent asset transactions, and you talk very much about having control in the Permian. I'm interested in terms of the moves both in Brazil and Mozambique to a certain degree where you've got less control. Is that a trend that we can expect more of outside U.S. onshore that you're prepared to take more non-operated positions? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I would say fundamentally, if we can operate, we feel like we've got the greatest value proposition to bring. But that doesn't make that an exclusive criterion. If we think that there is a good value proposition and the co-venture \u2013 the structure of the co-venture is certainly very much willing to go ahead and allow us to contribute to the maximum extent, that's what we're going to try to go ahead and set up. But the key here is the value capture proposition and the operatorship, and the qualifications of those operators and our ability to make sure that we can influence the outcomes is all incorporated in that value proposition. Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas : Okay, all right. Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks, Theepan. Operator : And we'll go to Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: Thanks, Jeff. I'll keep this to one question considering the timing. Just on Baytown, you've obviously reiterated you haven't had too much in terms of production impacts because of Harvey. But can you just give us an update on the steam cracker and the development project there in terms of just impacts, delays, and are there any carryover to 2018, and just if there's going to be a slower ramp-up to 2020 impacts? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: So just to recap, the whole project included a new steam cracker at Baytown for 1.5 million tons per annum. And then currently, we've invested in Mont Belvieu for the derivative units two 650,000-ton metallocene polyethylene trains. On the latter part, the first train has started up and the second train is starting up now. So we have started generating a revenue stream for that project. On the steam cracker, the site was temporarily shut down due to the hurricane, but the construction activities resumed once all of our assessments were completed. And right now, the plan is that we would get to mechanical completion early in the part of next year and then production by the middle of the year. Brendan Warn - BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: Okay, I appreciate the update. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You bet. Operator : Anish Kapadia from TPH has our next question. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Hi, Jeff. The first question was on Golden Pass. So I was just wondering how does that fit into your U.S. integration strategy. And has the decision by Qatar to increase its LNG capacity significantly shifted your partners' focus and I suppose your own focus in expanding production in Qatar rather than going ahead with Golden Pass? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Anish, it's a good question. As I said earlier, we've got a number of opportunities in which we can invest in order to capture that LNG demand growth. And we're progressing them all concurrently. Now, Golden Pass obviously is another key aspect of the value chain within North America gas. We're the largest producer of North American gas, so we continue to progress the opportunity there. As you know, after a fairly extensive period of time, earlier this year, we received the Department of Energy's authorization for export of LNG to non-FTA countries, which was an important milestone that happened in April of this year. Now we're focused on bringing together the remaining elements of the project, that being finalizing the technical definition as well as the commercial details for a final investment decision. But it is one of many opportunities that we're progressing. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Okay, thank you. And then I had another question. I just wanted to go back to the CapEx once again, and sorry to get back to that. I just wanted to clarify. So the way I understand the CapEx for this year, it seems like on an organic basis, if you strip out the acquisitions, it's approximately $17 billion, I think going up to $25 billion next year on an organic basis. So I just wanted to try and bridge what that gap is. So where does the incremental $8 billion come from? And the acquisition that was announced today from Statoil of approximately $1.4 billion, is that included also in the 2018 spend? Thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: A couple points. One is that, remember, when we set up a budget, there's a fair bit of flexibility. And fundamentally, what we're trying to do is live within our means. We're very focused on being selective in our investment program, maintaining our capital discipline. And there may be some things that we'll decide to slow down and replace it with an opportunity that comes in. So it's not necessarily that it's 100% fixed and all of the specific budget allocations are going to be executed with whatever we came up with in our planning process. I'll give you a good example, and I think I've said it before. Jurong Aromatics specifically was not in our budget for 2017. And we still believe that the budget guidance that we issued almost a year ago is still staying appropriate for sharing with you all. So there are some things that will move in and out. And as a result, there is a level of change-out \u2013 or dynamic change-out going on in that forward projection. If you go back to the 2018 and 2020 forward look, we shared with you in the analyst presentation the key components that were driving those capital expenditures over that timeframe, and that's probably the best guidance I've got for you at this point. Anish Kapadia - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. International LLP : Okay, thank you. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll now go to Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Jeff, we've talked a lot about the asset deals that you've done here, whether it's InterOil, Bass, the 22,000 acres, Jurong, Mozambique. But can you talk a little bit about the corporate M&A market? Now historically you guys have said that the U.S. E&P sector, for example, was not appropriately valued or you weren't able to identify attractive opportunities at the right price as that sector has underperformed or other corporate deals that are out there. Has that bid/ask started to close from your perspective? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I'd tell you, Neil, I would respond this way; that we're not limiting any of our potential opportunity base. So we'll keep open to where there may be attractive opportunities for us to pursue. Remember, there are two things you're trying to achieve here. One is, you're trying to \u2013 in anything you pick up, whether it'd be an asset acquisition or a corporate acquisition, you either want to get material synergy benefits or being able to add value above what the market values that asset at or both, ideally both. So we keep a very full look, we keep the aperture very wide on where there may be opportunities. But as you've seen here in the recent past, primarily where we see the greatest value is on asset acquisitions. Now, some of those assets were held by a single company, and that's what they had, so it ended up being one and the same. But right now, what's most attractive to us has been these asset acquisitions. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's great. And then the follow-up, Jeff, is just on your Canadian oil sands business. The ramp at Kearl has been taken a little bit longer than anticipated a few years ago, where do you stand there, and just the latest in terms of the potential sanctioning of that, recognizing that Imperial is also on a position to comment on this? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Clearly, I'll just say upfront, I mean, the Imperial organization has really worked Kearl very hard and making some really great progress. I give them a lot of credit for the progress that they're making. This is a long-lived asset, and we see the long-term value in it. It has not ramped up as we would have expected. But we have made, as I said, very good progress in reducing the cost structure and very focused on improving the reliability. And we're bringing the full capability of the organization to bear on this. And remember, this is just not the asset, we are thinking about the full value chain benefits as well. But I have the utmost confidence that the organization is going to continue to grow value on Kearl. And \u2013 but I think job number one right now is to get that reliability up. So we've got some work to be done there. And we are not shy about it, but we are very optimistic about where we are heading. Around future investments in the oil sands, I think I'd characterize it this way that \u2013 and, Neil, you've heard me say this before in that we are really building this business to be durable in a low-price environment. That means we've got to get the technology to the point that it is going to get the cost of supply down that regardless of where we are in the price cycle, that we're generating a very attractive return. And I will tell you, we've made great progress in terms of in situ technology and capability. And we're very encouraged by that progress, particularly in SA-SAGD. And \u2013 but I would say that we still got a little bit further to go. Not only are we at a point where we are able to substantially increase the overall return, but also reduce the cost, as well as reduce the environmental footprint. And that's important for us as we go forward. But we've got a very large acreage position, it's important that we get this thing right, and the organization is very focused on it. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You bet. Operator : We'll go to Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. When your guiding to CapEx for 2018, and you talk about the $25 billion number, what's the breakdown of that between organic and acquisitions? In other words, are you baking in credit for cash outlays on acquisition activity for next year? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Pavel. As we talked earlier, I mean, probably the best guidance I can give you right now would be going back and look at how we've segmented our investment plans between 2018 to 2020 in the Analyst Meeting. As I said earlier, if there is a transaction that we believe is very close to reaching agreement, we will typically go ahead and include it in our forward-looking investment plans, like Mozambique was for this year. But other than that, we keep some flexibility in our budget. And remember what we're trying to do here is, it's all about the value proposition. We're going to live within our means, we're going to manage our CapEx appropriately. We're going to keep our financial flexibility, but we are not going to forego opportunities. We've got significant financial capability to go ahead and pursue opportunities when they come up. And I think that is a unique attribute of this corporation, is that when, particularly in a down cycle, we can go ahead and respond fairly quickly when those opportunities come up. And let me say, a lot of them come up and they come up very quickly. You have got to be able to respond, and we've got the financial capability and the expertise to go ahead and accrete value on a lot of these things. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks, Pavel. Operator : And our next question comes from Rob West from Redburn. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Hi, thanks for having me on the call. In Brazil, you talked about competitive fiscal terms. And what I wanted to ask you is, are those fiscal terms competitive with something like the Permian? And really what's behind the question is, as you look at new resource opportunities now around the world, be it Mozambique or Brazil or other ones, how much do the fiscal terms have to compete with the fiscal terms in the Permian to make you want to invest? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Rob, think about it a couple of ways. One is, is that I think most resource owners understand that they are competing globally for investment dollars. And the key aspect of that is not only the quality of the resource endowment, but also how competitive the fiscal terms are. Are they globally competitive, are they transparent and are they stable and predictable, I mean, fundamentally? That's what's going to set for a very attractive investment climate. And where you have seen significant investment is generally tied to how those fiscal terms have supported an international investment program. Now, for us, Rob, it is not a kind of either or that we've got to do the Permian or we've got to do something else. As I said a moment ago, we've got sufficient financial flexibility. For us, it is the full package, the resource quality, the fiscal terms and our ability to go ahead and get to market from a value chain perspective and capture value. So it's always that value proposition. So we are making the trade-offs on the full value proposition to make sure that we are meeting our fundamental mission here, and that is growing shareholder value with accretive investments. Now, our portfolio is very geographically diverse, and there are some political aspects that we've got to tie into these investment decisions. And I think that's an attribute of the corporation that once again is very unique. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Okay. So just the first part of that question was on whether the fiscal terms in Brazil are competitive with fiscal terms in Permian. I'm not sure if you missed that one or you can't comment on it. I just wanted to go back. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No, I really don't have anything to share on comparing and contrasting specific asset fiscal terms. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Let me ask another one then. And one point you've made before that I think has been well made is that your scale gives you better long term-ism when it comes to procurement, and I was wondering. In 3Q 2017, was that the case in the area of pressure pumping, where it's pretty well known there have been some bottlenecks that have been constraining completion activity? And I'm wondering. Does your scale and long-term procurement in purchases in the Permian, did it help you avoid any of that bottleneck that you can share with us? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Let me respond to you in kind of a broader perspective is that, and it's very similar to what I said earlier, Rob, where developing these long-term supplier relationships is really critical to make sure that we're all in the same page in terms of the quality standards, the operating standards that we adhere to. And when we see cost pressures, we are very quick to react upon, okay, how are we building in the value proposition in our go-forward plans and how do we offset those potential cost increases with more unique alternatives. It might be something as we've seen very significant in the Permian, and that's technology application. So there's been some \u2013 in 2017, by way of example, there has been some inflationary pressures largely in the unconventional business. But we have been able to offset that with these cost reductions that we are seeing in our drilling program by way of example. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Okay. The final one I wanted to ask you is on the San Patricio cracker that I think follows Mont Belvieu, could you just quickly give us a sense of timing on that? And start looking like that as a \u2013 something that you're going to really accelerate when Mont Belvieu finishes, or is it really longer term? Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. So this is \u2013 it's independent of where the Baytown cracker is. This is a \u2013 again, a part of the value chain. For the broader group on the phone, this is a joint \u2013 a proposed jointly owned petrochemical facility that would be a 1.8 million ton per annum ethylene steam cracker, and then derivative units monoethylene glycol plant and polyethylene plant. And we have \u2013 as you pointed out, we've selected a site in San Patricio County. And right now, we're beginning \u2013 we've been working with our partner to begin the planning for front-end engineering and design work. So once we get to the point where we think we've got a good laid out plan, we've moved in the permitting phase. Once we get all the ducks in a row, then we'll make a decision on whether we'd move forward with funding. But it is very well positioned on the Gulf Coast to take full advantage of the feedstock that primarily would be coming from the Permian and the Eagle Ford. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Okay, thanks for taking my questions. That's great. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay, Rob. Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah. Hi. Just two quick ones. Regarding Guyana and Phases 2 and 3, Jeff, will this be a lot like Angola where every two years you roll out another FPSO system? I mean, I know it's still early days, but I'm just curious. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. No \u2013 John, good morning. Very similar. I mean, if you think about my comments, you really want to get into that manufacturing mode very quickly. If you've got the resource \u2013 obviously, we're going to continue our exploration program, hopefully continue to grow the resource. You want to get into that manufacturing process because that will help continue to progress that learning curve and reduce your overall cost. So I keep on thinking about it like the Angola program that we did on Block 15. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay, great. And then one question on Brazil. Since you're getting a little further away from the initial discoveries by Petrobras and all that, are you assuming that the pay zones are going to be carbonates or clastics? And that's it for me. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: This is early days, and we've got to \u2013 like I said, we do have some of our own seismic that we are analyzing, and it's really going to be different wherever we are with the acreage that we've picked up. But in the outer Campos Basin, it's primarily carbonate pre-salt. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay, you've got a lot of experience in that, I was just curious. Petrobras certainly can use the help. Thanks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: All right. Thank you, John. Operator : And there are no further questions, I will turn it back over to you, Mr. Woodbury, for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey J. Woodbury - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, lot of good questions this morning. I really do very much appreciate your time and your thoughts that you've put behind those questions. And, of course, we look forward to our communications \u2013 our ongoing communications, and we do appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. So, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our Web site. Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our 2017 performance. Exxon Mobil earned $8.4 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date earnings to $19.7 billion. Our cash flow from operations and asset sales exceeded our dividends and investments for the year by more than $1 billion. We continue advancing attractive opportunities across all our business segments. In the Upstream, we closed the Mozambique Area 4 acquisition and we made our sixth discovery offshore Guyana. I\u2019ll share for more detail about these items and others later in the discussion. Included in our results is a non-cash earnings gain of $5.9 billion resulting from U.S. tax reform. This reflects the magnitude of Exxon Mobil\u2019s historic investments in the United States. These investments have created large deferred income tax liabilities which when revalued at the new tax rate results in a one-time non-cash benefit to earnings. The deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings is not significant to Exxon Mobil as we have paid taxes on non-U.S. earnings at tax rates above 35% on average. Partly offsetting this earnings benefit is $1.3 billion of fourth quarter asset impairments in the Upstream. These impairments are primarily related to non-producing assets in Canada and dry gas production operations notably in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of some of the external factors affecting our results. Overall, the global economy experienced moderate growth in the quarter. Estimated GDP growth for the U.S., Eurozone and Japan softened in comparison to the third quarter. Meanwhile, economic expansion remained steady in China. Crude oil prices strengthened over the quarter whereas natural gas prices were mixed, as North American prices declined but prices in Europe and Asia Pacific increased. Global rig count remains steady. Finally, refining margins decreased with lower seasonal gasoline demand and global chemical margins softened due to higher feed and energy costs. Turning now to the financial results on Slide 5. As indicated, Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings were $8.4 billion or $1.97 per share. In the quarter, corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders.  Our CapEx was $9 billion, reflecting the completion of our Mozambique Area 4 acquisition, bonus payments for our successful acreage bids in Brazil and increased activity in our unconventional portfolio. All of these are key elements of our future growth potential. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.8 billion, including proceeds from asset sales of $1.4 billion, driven by divestment of some operated Upstream assets in Norway as well as our Norwegian retail network. Cash totaled $3.2 billion at the end of the quarter and debt was $42.3 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion from the prior quarter due to increased CapEx. The next slide provides additional detail on sources and uses of cash. Over the quarter, cash balances decreased from $4.3 billion to $3.2 billion. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, yielded $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. A negative adjustment for working capital and other items mainly reflects changes in deferred tax balances from U.S. tax reform. Uses of cash included shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and net investments in the business of $7.9 billion. An increase in debt and other financing items increased cash by $1.3 billion. In the first quarter of 2018, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefits plans and programs. Moving on to Slide 7 for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter earnings increased $6.7 billion from a year-ago quarter due to non-cash impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments as well as improved Upstream results as tax reform added $5.9 billion to earnings while the fourth quarter asset impairments of nearly $1.3 billion were more than offset by the absence of impairments in the prior year quarter. The Upstream business increased earnings $1 billion primarily due to stronger prices. This was partly offset by higher expenses in the corporate and financing segment primarily due to the absence of favorable, one-time non-U.S. tax items in the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 8. Fourth quarter Upstream earnings were $8.4 billion, an increase of $9 billion from the prior-year quarter, driven by non-cash impacts and higher realizations. Largest of these was the result of U.S. tax reform. Also as I mentioned earlier, we took impairments of $1.3 billion. These were associated with non-producing assets, including Horn River and the Mackenzie Gas in Canada as well as dry gas producing assets, mostly in the Gulf of Mexico. There were more than offset by the absence of last year\u2019s fourth quarter impairments. Realizations increased earnings by $1.2 billion. Crude prices rose nearly $11 per barrel versus the year-ago quarter, whereas gas realizations increased about $0.60 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $110 million due to lower entitlements and mix effects. All other items decreased earnings by $60 million. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $7.07 per barrel, excluding U.S. tax reform, impairments and the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Moving now to Slide 9. Oil equivalent production in the quarter was 4 million barrels per day, a decrease of 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Liquids production decreased 133,000 barrels per day as field decline, lower entitlements and divestment of some Norwegian assets more than offset volumes from new projects and more programs. Natural gas production increased 17 million cubic feet per day. Growth from projects and work programs and higher entitlements were probably offset by decline, reduced demand and regulatory impacts in the Netherlands as the new gas year began in October. Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results on Slide 10. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $1.6 billion, up $323 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Stronger margins, mainly in the U.S., increased earnings by $250 million. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by 190 million mainly from increased maintenance activities. All other items reduced earnings by $350 million, mostly due to the absence of asset management gains of the prior year quarter, including over $500 million related to the sale of Canadian retail assets. This was partially offset by asset management gains in the current quarter. U.S. tax reform had a positive impact of over $600 million. Moving now to the Chemical financial and operating results on Slide 11. Fourth quarter Chemical earnings were $1.3 billion, up almost $400 million compared to the prior-year quarter. Weaker specialty margins due to increased feed and energy costs decreased earnings by $30 million. Favorable volume and mix effects reflecting our highest product sales in a decade improved earnings by $100 million. All other items decreased earnings by 10 million. And U.S. tax reform had a positive impact of $335 million. Turning now to the summary of our full year 2017 financial results on Slide 12. As I mentioned, 2017 earnings totaled $19.7 billion or $4.63 per share. Corporation distributed $13 billion in dividends to our shareholders. CapEx totaled $23.1 billion for the year reflecting our commitment to pursuing high-value opportunities. Our financial strength and flexibility enabled us to capitalize on opportunities that arose throughout the year such as the acquisition of Jurong Aromatics in Singapore and our success in the Brazil bid rounds while still remaining within 5% of our original 2017 guidance. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $33.2 billion. And year-end debt was $42.3 billion, down $0.5 billion from the beginning of the year. Turning to Slide 13. Cash decreased from $3.7 billion to $3.2 billion in the year. Earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program, resulted in 33 billion of cash flow from operations in asset sales. And negative working capital and other impacts for the year were again largely driven by changes in deferred tax balances from U.S. tax reform. Uses of the cash include shareholder distributions of $13 billion and net investments of almost 19 billion. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by 1.8 billion. This includes anti-dilutive purchases of about $0.5 billion. Moving to Slide 14. This graph illustrates the corporation\u2019s sources and uses of cash during the year and it highlights our ability to meet our financial objectives. The corporation generated solid cash flow from operations and asset sales which more than covered our dividend and net investments in the business. Our strong cash generation and balance sheet continued to provide the financial flexibility to invest in attractive opportunities. During the year, Exxon Mobil generated $14.3 billion of free cash flow, up nearly 50% from 2016, primarily due to the stronger price environment and our disciplined approach to investing. As indicated, shareholder distributions totaled $13 billion. Annual per share dividends were up 2.7% compared to 2016, marking the 35th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. Looking ahead, we anticipate our 2018 capital and exploration expenditures will be about $24 billion. While we continue to invest across all segments, this increase compared to 2017 is primarily driven by higher investment in short-cycle Upstream opportunities, notably U.S. unconventional activity and conventional work programs, both of which yield attractive returns at $40 per barrel. We\u2019re also pursuing strategic investments in the Downstream and Chemical businesses. Now I know there is a lot of interest in our investment plans and we\u2019ll share more details including clarity on the value proposition at our Analyst Meeting in early March. Moving now to Slide 15 and a full review of our full year segmented results. 2017 earnings increased almost $12 billion due to U.S. tax reform and impairments, higher realizations in the Upstream and higher margins in the Downstream. Probably offsetting these gains were higher expenses in our corporate and financing segment primarily due to the absence of favorable one-time non-U.S. tax items in 2016. In light of the new U.S. tax rate, we expect our corporate and financing expenses to range from $600 million to $800 million per quarter. In the first quarter of 2018, we expect this expense to be at the high end of this range. Further guidance will be shared later in the year as we continue to evaluate the full impact of tax reform. Our full year effective tax rate was 5%, which includes the impact of tax reform and impairments. Excluding these impacts, our full year 2017 tax rate was 35%. 2018 assuming current commodity prices and the existing portfolio mix, we anticipate that the effective tax rate will remain between 25% and 35%, excluding the impact of any large one-time items. This guidance also includes the expected impact of U.S. tax reform. Turning now to the full year comparison of Upstream results starting on Slide 16. Full year Upstream earnings were $13.4 billion, an increase of over $13 billion from the prior year. The largest contributing factors were U.S. tax reform, impairments and higher realizations. Crude prices rose more than $10 per barrel versus 2016 and gas realizations increased about $0.80 per 1,000 cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $440 million primarily due to lower entitlements. All other items increased earnings $510 million driven by lower operating expenses which were partly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Excluding the impact of U.S. tax reform, impairments and non-controlling interest volumes, Upstream unit profitability for 2017 was almost $5.50 per barrel. Moving to Slide 17. Full year oil equivalent production was 4 million barrels per day, a decrease of 2% compared to 2016. Liquids production decreased 82,000 barrels per day. Growth from new project volumes and work programs were more than offset by field decline, lower entitlements and asset sales. Natural gas production increased 84 million cubic feet per day. Volumes from projects and work programs were partly offset by a decline, regulatory impacts and reduced demand. Full year comparison for Downstream results is shown on Slide 18. Downstream earnings were $5.6 billion, an increase of 1.4 billion from 2016. Stronger margins across all regions increased earnings by about 1.5 billion. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $30 million due to lower throughput caused by Hurricane Harvey and higher maintenance activities in the U.S. These were mostly offset by improved operations in Europe and Asia. All other items decreased earnings $710 million. This is primarily driven by the absence of last year\u2019s $900 million gain related to the sale of Canadian retail assets and expenses related to the hurricane. This was partly offset by asset management gains in the current year. U.S. tax reform and lower impairments increased earnings by $664 million. On Slide 19, we show the full year comparison with Chemical results. 2017 earnings were $4.5 billion, down almost 100 million from 2016. Weaker commodity and specialty margins, driven by increased feed and energy costs, decreased earnings by $260 million. Favorable volume and mix effects added 100 million driven by stronger demand, partly offset by impacts of Hurricane Harvey. All other items reduced earnings by $270 million reflecting higher expenses from turnarounds and new business growth. U.S. tax reform increased earnings by $335 million. Moving next to an update on some of our key business highlights. First, we\u2019ve had continued success at offshore Guyana. As indicated, we announced our sixth offshore discovery with the successful Ranger well. And importantly, this well proves yet another new play in the Stabroek block. The well encountered 230 feet of oil-bearing carbonate reservoirs. We are encouraged by these results and have further work ahead to determine the full commercial potential of this resource. We\u2019ll likely drill a delineation well later this year. To-date, we have discovered more than 3.2 billion oil equivalent barrels of recoverable resource on the Stabroek block and this excludes the recent Ranger discovery. Rig has now moved to the Pacora prospect where it has spud another well cap well near the Payara discovery. Our phase development of the Liza discovery is progressing with Phase 1 on track for first oil in March of 2020. Development drilling is planned to start this year. A second drilling rig is in route to Guyana and we envision a two-rig drilling program through the end of the year. We\u2019ve also submitted an application for environmental permit to develop the second phase of Liza. Concept includes a larger FPSO and subsea systems. This facility concept we have production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day with start-up expected by mid-2022. Payara is now planned as the third development offshore Guyana, mostly following Liza Phase 2. Payara has the potential to raise Guyana\u2019s production to about 450,000 barrels of oil per day in total. Turning to Slide 21, we\u2019ll provide an update on some activities that are positioning Exxon Mobil to provide low cost of supply natural gas to meet growing global demand. In December, we announced the completion of our transaction to acquire a 25% indirect interest in Mozambique\u2019s gas-rich Area 4 block. Exxon Mobil will lead the onshore construction and operation of all future natural gas liquefaction facilities with scope of more than 40 million tons of LNG per year. Eni will continue to lead the Coral South floating LNG project in all Upstream operations in Area 4. Part of the deal closure, we have funded our share of participation in the Coral project. We\u2019ve also secunded a number of employees into Eni\u2019s project organization in key roles to leverage our extensive global LNG and project development experience. We are proud to bring our LNG leadership and experience to Mozambique to support development of this world-class resource. Now in Papua New Guinea, we encountered hydrocarbons in the P\u2019nyang South appraisal well where we found high-quality sandstone reservoirs. This successful well confirms the Southeast extension of the field, a growing inventory of natural gas resources in Papua New Guinea and support a multi-train expansion of our PNG, LNG facilities. In offshore Cyprus, plans are progressing for Block 10. Acquisition of a 3D seismic survey was completed in 2017. The first well on the block in this promising gas-prone region is planned to spud later this year. Lastly, we signed production sharing contracts with the government of Mauritania for three deepwater offshore blocks. Together, these blocks cover nearly 8.4 million acres in water depths up to 11,500 feet. Exploration activity, including seismic acquisition, is planned to begin this year following government ratification of the contracts. Moving to Slide 22. Exxon Mobil continues to demonstrate its project execution expertise by starting up two projects in the fourth quarter of 2017, both of which were executed safely and on schedule in challenging operating environments. The Hebron project offshore Newfoundland and Labrador achieved first oil in November. The project consists of the gravity-based structure which will be able to produce up to 150,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak. Total recoverable resources are estimated to exceed 700 million barrels of oil. In eastern Russia, the Odoptu Stage 2 project, another arctic development, started in December. The project increases the Odoptu field production capacity to 65,000 barrels per day. And in Abu Dhabi, we are continuing our efforts to increase production at Upper Zakum. The Upper Zakum 750 project is making excellent progress, currently producing approximately 670,000 barrels of oil per day. We\u2019ve been steadily increasing production on all four artificial islands. The joint venture partners recently signed an agreement to pursue further production growth with plans to increase production to 1 million barrels per day by 2024. Expansion will continue to use extended-reach drilling and completion technologies as well as state-of-the-art reservoir characterization and modeling techniques to effectively position wells. Infrastructure and facilities will be further expanded in a modular approach maximizing capital efficiency and lowering costs. Turning now to Slide 23. The graph on the right shows our progress to-date on development of our unconventional liquids volumes. Our total production from the Delaware, Midland, and Bakken basins is now about 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. We are progressing plans to ramp up to around 36 operated rigs in the Permian and Bakken by year end, of which 30 will be in the Delaware and Midland basins. With a continued focus on maximizing capital efficiency, we are drilling long lateral wells made possible by our contiguous acreage position. We\u2019re incorporating learnings real time and continue to optimize both the lateral lengths and completion designs. In the Bakken, for example, we\u2019ve made significant progress improving productivity through optimized completions. Recent wells had initial production rates in the top quintile of surrounding industry wells with the best 30-day average rate exceeding 2,500 barrels of oil per day. Looking forward, these longer laterals with optimized completions could potentially generate a 15% to 20% increase in our expected ultimate recovery from the Bakken wells, further supporting our growth plans in tight oil. We expect to drill another 15 to 20 three-mile lateral wells in the Bakken this year. Transferring our learnings from the Bakken into the Permian, we recently started producing our first 12,500-foot lateral well in the Delaware Basin. This well has successfully met our pre-drill expectations. Also, we recently finished drilling our first three-mile lateral in the Midland Basin and we\u2019re currently drilling our second. We\u2019ve continued to grow our service understanding in the Permian, integrating information from our own drilled wells and those on offsetting acreage. With multiple pay zones on our Delaware Basin acreage, we are working to evaluate the full prospectively of these stacked intervals. To support our production growth plans, Exxon Mobil will be investing more than $2 billion in Midstream infrastructure, including expansion of the Wink terminal. This will build additional takeaway flexibility to efficiently move production from the Permian to Exxon Mobil\u2019s manufacturing facilities in the Gulf Coast region. We will share additional information about our plans for the Permian Basin at our upcoming Analyst Meeting. Moving now to the final slide, I\u2019d like to conclude today\u2019s prepared remarks with a summary of our 2017 performance which demonstrates our relentless focus on value, underpinned by the unique strengths of our company. Our integrated businesses have grown cash flow from operations and asset sales to over $33 billion and earnings to almost $20 billion. Excluding U.S. tax reform and impairments, our business segments have earned over $15 billion, an increase of more than 50% compared to 2016. Upstream production volumes were within our guidance range at 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day. Our investment in high-quality opportunities across all segments resulted in total 2017 capital expenditures of just over $23 billion. We continue to invest in our business through attractive opportunities, including strategic acquisitions across the value chain. These investments set the foundation to continue generating value for our shareholders for many years to come. Our free cash flow of over $14 billion more than covered our shareholder distributions of $13 billion. Finally, we remain committed to a reliable and growing dividend as evidenced by increasing our dividends per share for the 35th consecutive year. Entering 2018, we believe our integrated businesses positioned with a robust portfolio and a strong pipeline of high-quality projects will continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We\u2019ll discuss our forward plans in more detail at the upcoming Analyst Meeting which will take place at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, March 7. We have an aggressive plan to drive value growth and we will look forward to the conversation with you. So that concludes my prepared remarks. I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : Jeff, returns in Exxon Mobil\u2019s Downstream business were sustained at really high levels in decades past and you guys still lead almost every global peer from what I can tell. Simultaneously in the Upstream, while the company is rightfully enthusiastic about its Permian business as indicated by your recent guidance in that area and some of your slides today, returns elsewhere in the Upstream declined fairly meaningfully in recent years and they appear to be in need of remediation. So while your peers have the same problem, several of them have provided plans for improvement and time periods of which they expect to improve their performance. So, my first is that with the Analyst Meeting coming up, why wouldn\u2019t a company specify an improvement plan for Upstream since it\u2019s around 80% of corporate capital employed and it\u2019s probably the driver of Exxon Mobil stock which is obviously really important to you guys? And then second, do you think that Exxon Mobil\u2019s emphasis on the industry-leading financial performance rather than an absolute return target better serve shareholders when considering that a lot of your peers had declining returns over kind of the last decade or so? So it\u2019s two questions but it\u2019s really on the same topic. Jeff Woodbury : Doug, on the first topic, the real objective for the corporation as you know is to very clearly make the investment case that of our growth prospects and the fundamental mission of creating long-term shareholder value. We are going to detail out in the Analyst Meeting the value proposition that we see. As I said, we have an aggressive growth plan across all three business segments. We\u2019ve got three world-class businesses that have very robust portfolios that we are going to fully leverage to go ahead and lay out that value proposition over the long term. So I certainly acknowledge the drop that we\u2019ve seen in the Upstream business and the return on capital employed and I think we\u2019re going to lay out a growth plan that\u2019s going to demonstrate where we\u2019re heading in not only to enhance the Upstream return but furthermore continue to build in the Downstream and Chemical businesses which I think you recognize are very important to the corporation as a whole given our independent business model. Doug Terreson : Well, I think that would be great. Sorry, Jeff, go ahead. Jeff Woodbury : Go ahead, Doug. Doug Terreson : I was just going to say, well, I think that would be welcomed and rewarded in the market. More specifics, the better obviously but I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, and just following up on the last part about the return on capital employed, I think we\u2019ve talked in the past that that remains a key objective for the corporation. I know there\u2019s a lot of interest about our capital investment program. I think we\u2019re going to demonstrate the quality of the portfolio and that our shareholders are best served for us to continue to invest to capture that value. Doug Terreson : Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff. We look forward to it. Jeff Woodbury : All right. Thanks, Doug. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Jeff, I wonder if I could start by taking you back to the cash flow. I understand you tried to walk us through some of the moving parts, but oil up quite nicely in the quarter and your cash flow is flat it looks like on an underlying basis. Can you walk us through whether there\u2019s any unusual situations going on in there whether it\u2019d be hurricane related or cost or anything like that? It just is kind of hard to explain why the cash flow is as light as it was and maybe explain a little better on the working capital move? Jeff Woodbury : On the cash flow, as I explained in the prepared comments, Doug, the big impact is obviously in the working capital and other and that was primarily driven by the U.S. tax reform. There were other less significant changes to the deferred tax balances that impacted cash flow. As I said, in that cash flow we had assets sales of about 1.5 billion largely associated with some of our Norwegian divestments in our operated Upstream and our retail sector. Doug Leggate : Sure. So I\u2019m thinking more of the ex-asset sales number, I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but just to be clear. So if it\u2019s largely nonrecurring, you\u2019re underlying cash flow then would have been closer to 13 billion, is that right or am I missing something? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re coming up with that calculation, Doug, to be able to comment on it. Doug Leggate : 7.4 plus the 6.5 basically. Working capital draw 6 and change and your underlying was you reported 7.5 ex the asset sales. Am I wrong? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, remember the earnings include the upwards associated with the U.S. tax reform. You got to back that \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the cash flow analyses. You\u2019ve got $5.9 billion in U.S. tax reform benefits in the earnings and then in the working capital and other you\u2019re backing that out to come out with the cash. Doug Leggate : Okay. So that\u2019s really the roots of my question and so if I look at ex all that out, you\u2019re underlying cash flow was flat sequentially on a significant increase in oil price. What\u2019s going on? Jeff Woodbury : When you look at overall unit profitability, it remains strong on the assets. We had a number of one-time effects in our portfolio that I talked about in my prepared comments that lowered the overall \u2013 in fact in several of the segments that lowered the overall earnings in that quarter. Doug Leggate : Okay. I\u2019ll take it offline and maybe go in more detail. Let me try one final one if I may and it\u2019s on the increase in the rig count. So the chart you\u2019ve shown I think is the same chart you\u2019ve shown multiple times before. But you have, if I\u2019m not mistaken, taken the rig count up. So why are we not seeing any increase in the production guide? Jeff Woodbury : Doug, you\u2019re talking about the Permian and Bakken now? Doug Leggate : Yes. So I think you talked about 30 rigs by the end of '18 previously and now you\u2019re talking 36. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So as you can see from the display, you can see that we are tracking in the guidance that we provided. We did have a bit of downtime in the fourth quarter associated with weather notably in the Bakken and you can see that in the variation on the red line that\u2019s tracking. We\u2019re doing well in terms of working off the ducts [ph] that have built up. And I think we\u2019re right on our plans in terms of ramping up. Doug Leggate : All right. I\u2019ll wait for the Analyst Day. Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Paul Sankey : Hi, Jeff. Jeff, can I just follow up on Doug\u2019s question about working capital? Can we just have the working capital number alone? Jeff Woodbury : Working capital number alone -- Paul Sankey : For the shift in the quarters. Sorry. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, the working capital alone in the quarter is just $200 million. Paul Sankey : And that\u2019s the amount of working capital or the change \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to get to is the sequential -- Jeff Woodbury : I\u2019m sorry. Paul Sankey : So basically \u2013 so to further what Doug Leggate said, the sequential cash flow is essentially flat. Jeff Woodbury : That\u2019s right. Paul Sankey : Okay. Thanks. If we could go on just to your volumes, I can imagine that the 40s impact was significant on oil in Europe. I would assume that the African problem in terms of declining volumes was PSC effects in Nigeria maybe. We\u2019re also seeing some weakness in Asia. These are all liquids questions, Jeff. Could you just run around the world and kind of give us the reasons for the issues in the liquids volumes? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, if you look at the quarter-on-quarter volumes, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s really broken up into three key components, which is taken by thirds \u2013 about a third of it is associated with PSC effects driven by the higher prices. The second third is associated with asset sales. And on the liquids side that is all associated with our sale of our operated assets in Norway on Upstream. And then the last third is primarily associated with a base decline in our portfolio offset by project and work program build up. Paul Sankey : That\u2019s great. Thank you. My final question is, Jeff, there\u2019s a lot of press around $50 billion of spending which you\u2019re going to make in the U.S. It wasn\u2019t quite what was written in downwards press release. I think it was a blog post that you guys put out. I wasn\u2019t sure \u2013 and it was kind of not by Darren but by everyone else was kind of tied to the tax reform that we\u2019ve seen here in the U.S. Can you just talk a little bit about how much incremental capital in the U.S. you\u2019re going to spend as a result of the tax changes and sort of if you could annualize the number, it would be helpful just to get a small clarity on your spending over the coming years? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : There\u2019s a couple of elements to what you\u2019re talking about. One is the 50 billion that we had projected in the U.S. over the next five years, let me give you a little bit color on the 50 billion. About two-thirds of that is in the Upstream portfolio. As you would anticipate, a lot of that is in our unconventional activity. The rest is split fairly evenly between our Downstream and our Chemical portfolios. If you look at the quality of those investments, as you would expect they\u2019re very robust in the Upstream unconventional business and the rest of the conventional work program generated greater than 10% return on investment at a $40 flat rail. The Downstream and Chemical investments are 15% to 20% plus. So that\u2019s kind of the forward definition of the anticipated spend in the U.S. over the next five years. Think about the overall U.S. tax reform and the way I\u2019d characterize is the following that we clearly believe that the reform will make the investment climate more attractive. It will lead to things like capital inflow, group profitability, new jobs, ultimately higher returns for savings plans. The same is true for Exxon Mobil and we believe the changes will help strengthen our investment plans. The 50 billion that we\u2019ve talked about is a projection. We haven\u2019t made a decision to move forward with those investments at this point, but certainly the U.S. tax reform is going to strengthen and build that investment confidence. So really what the message was just one of we\u2019re encouraged by an improved competitive positioning within the U.S. for an investment climate. We\u2019ve got 50 billion that we\u2019ve got projected going forward. We\u2019ve got some other projects that are on the table that are not in the 50 billion that we\u2019re \u2013 in light of the current tax basis, we are going to step back and take a look at. So other than that, I don\u2019t have any other specifics to break out specific dollars associated with incremental expenditures on the U.S. tax reform. Paul Sankey : No, but that was helpful. Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you, Paul. Operator : We will take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. My question is a follow up to Paul\u2019s just around the production. I appreciate the color around the thirds breakout. If you look at the base plus projects piece, it\u2019s about a third that looks like that would be about down 1% year-over-year. I\u2019m wondering how you feel about that performance in 2017 and how we should think about 2018 specifically? Obviously there were projects coming out in '17 but there are also maybe some one-time factors in 2017. So is that something that you\u2019d expect to grow in 2018, given that the other two pieces could be a little bit more nonrecurring? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, good question, Phil. Let me take the prior discussion from a quarter-on-quarter dialogue to a year-on-year. And if you look at the year-on-year volumes, down 2% overall. Liquids is primarily driven by entitlement effects, price effects and divestments. Liquids is actually up in everything in the rest of the variables. So as we think going forward, a key driver for our volumes and we\u2019ve detailed for you is the unconventional growth program. We\u2019ve got some projects that we still expect to start up in 2018. But more specifically as we sit down in the Analyst Meeting next month, we\u2019re going to lay out what that looks like in terms of volume growth. Phil Gresh : Okay. The essence of the question was, you generally have expected 4.0 to 4.4 have long-term range and you came in below that. So I was trying to think through 2018 specifically realizing you\u2019ll give more longer term color later. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Let me just clarify your comment. When we gave that range, it was ex asset sales and entitlements. So my point being is, is that if you look at 2017 to 2016 reconciliation, the deviation is primarily or is all in those areas. Phil Gresh : Sure. Okay. Jeff Woodbury : Simply put, higher prices drove the volumes down and we went ahead and monetized some assets that we thought we can get greater value from on the market as opposed to continuing operations. Again, as we go forward we\u2019re going to go ahead and detail that out as to what our current views are in terms of our investment program and how that will impact our volumes. Phil Gresh : Okay. My second question was just on the capital allocation. I think some investors were hoping that perhaps you would announce a buyback for 2018 given the strength of the balance sheet and the higher oil price environment? And I know Exxon generally views it as a flywheel. But given your capital spending number for 2018, it would seem like you would have some potential room to do that if oil prices hold where they are. So just if you can update us conceptually and how you think about that? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So, Phil not \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed our view on how we manage our capital allocation. First and foremost is that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in attractive opportunities that are accretive to our overall financial performance. As we\u2019ve said many times and as I said today, we\u2019re going to maintain our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend. And then with excess cash, we\u2019ll decide whether there are more opportunities that we can invest in or do we go ahead and return that to the shareholder via buyback program. And we think about that on a quarterly basis. We look at a number of factors to assess whether we want to go ahead and buy shares or we want to pursue some additional opportunities. But I think the underlying message in what I\u2019m trying to convey is that we have a very attractive investment opportunity and we really do believe that we can generate a better shareholder return by pursuing these investments if they\u2019re ready to go ahead and be funded. But like I\u2019ve said before in the past that we\u2019re not going to hold large cash reserves and if we don\u2019t have immediate use to put that to work, we will go ahead and purchase some shares back as a means for shareholder distributions. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Thanks, Phil. Operator : We will take our next question from Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta : Jeff, can we talk about the $24 billion 2018 capital spending? The previous number was around 25, so it shaved lower. Is that just a function of deflation? And historically there\u2019s been a couple billion dollars of M&A-related capital spending in there. So any color in terms of how we should think about what that organic CapEx level is? And then if you could just juxtapose that against whatever 2017 organic CapEx was ex-acquisition just to help us frame the bridge from '17 to '18 spending? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, sure. So as you know there was a fair bit of inorganic CapEx in 2017. And if you look at the build from 2017 to 2018 just ballpark numbers, you\u2019re talking about a $5 billion to $6 billion increase in organic \u2013 total CapEx in organic activity. Now I will highlight that there is some inorganic funds in that 2018 which is associated with the payments for the farm-in in Brazil for the North Carcara field. So what does that increase represent? It really represents \u2013 the lion share of it is in the Upstream business. Again, mostly it\u2019s associated with the unconventional work program and some conventional work program across our global portfolio. As I indicated before when we were talking about the five-year projection of $50 billion, that is a very attractive investment. We\u2019ve got \u2013 at a low price forecast we\u2019ve got returns in excess of 10% with a $40 per barrel flat rail. I would tell you the investment plan is optimize to achieve attractive returns even in a low price environment. And the plan includes \u2013 it does include some investments to maintain our license to operate as well as investments that have attractive future potential. But the lion share of that increase year-on-year is associated with more short-cycle investment that is highly attractive even in a low price environment. Neil Mehta : Got it, Jeff. And the follow up and you and I talked about this last month, but how you\u2019re thinking about M&A in this environment, whether it is \u2013 when you think about where you see value as a company? Is it still in the private market or how do you think about the public market as well? Historically, the message has been that the value has been more on the private market. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, really no fundamental change. We\u2019re not going to filter out potential opportunities. We\u2019re going to keep a wide brief and make sure that aperture is wide open. And if there is something that we can identify that could effectively compete with our existing inventory investment opportunities, well then obviously it makes a lot of sense for the corporation to go ahead and pursue it. But to-date, as you\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re probably much more focused on assets that we see synergistic benefits with our existing operations as well as where we bring a capability where we can get additional value for the assets and what the market maybe valuing it at. And I would highlight for the group that if you look at what we did over 2017, we did a nice job in taking full advantage of the market conditions and picked up some high quality, very competitive opportunities that has really positioned our portfolio even in a stronger state than it was historically. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re going to be talking about in the upcoming Analyst Meeting. Neil Mehta : All right, Jeff. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple questions on LNG. You have a little bit in there in the presentation on Mozambique. The deal is closed. You suggest that it could be upwards of 40 megatons a year which is a big capacity. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about long-term development of the assets there, the timing of the development path there in Mozambique and maybe what \u2013 is the assumption that you would supply all of the relevant gas from Area 4 or would you look to bridge that with Area 1 as well in the region there? Jeff Woodbury : Ryan, as I said, a very high quality. We believe it\u2019s well on the left side of the cost of supply curve. So it\u2019s going to compete very well in the market. A very substantial resource, over 85 trillion cubic feet in place. And there\u2019s clearly synergies to be had between Area 1 and Area 4. We just closed the deal. We\u2019ve got an engagement with all the partners to lay out the forward development schedule. So it\u2019s really too early for us to convey specifics in terms of what program in the timeline, but I can tell you that this is going to take a central focus on our development planning efforts to make sure that we\u2019re getting at it just like you\u2019ve seen us do in other places like Guyana and Papua New Guinea. And then on top of that you\u2019re probably aware that we have exploration acreage in the area that we\u2019re also progressing concurrently that has some really high prospectively. So I\u2019ll leave it there. Ryan Todd : And maybe as a follow up on LNG, with \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but with Mozambique not closed, you have additional appraisal success there in PNG. Golden Pass LNG was always kind of in the hopper at some point as well. How do you think about \u2013 and it feels like the environment is improving from a gas, sales and contracting point of view. I guess first is, is that true? And then how do you think about the timing of the relative priority of these LNG projects? And is it necessary to stagger them or would you actually see benefits in proceeding with multiple LNG projects simultaneously? Jeff Woodbury : Let\u2019s start with the fundamentals. If you look at the supply/demand projection, we\u2019ve got gas growing at about 1.5% per year between now and 2040 and we\u2019ve got LNG growing over two times over this time period. So that is the prize that we\u2019re working towards. Now of course in order to compete for that, we have got to have the lowest cost of supply. And you\u2019ve highlighted two key areas, Papua New Guinea and Mozambique, we think will compete very strongly for that. Now obviously there\u2019s a \u2013 with any LNG project, there is a very large upfront capital investment. We typically have walked in these funding decisions on long-term LNG contracts. We\u2019ve got very strong marketing connections and a very strong reputation in the market. So we\u2019re out there going ahead and putting in place the commercial structure. But fundamentally, Ryan, it really needs to be robust enough to underpin such a substantial investment. But we\u2019re very positive about where we\u2019re heading with it. We think we\u2019re going to be very competitive with offerings that we have in both those assets as well as some others that we\u2019re pursuing. And you\u2019ll hear more about the details as we go into the Analyst Meeting. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brendan Warn with BMO Capital Markets. Brendan Warn : Hi, Jeff. Just two questions, I guess first question on Chemicals. Can you just give us an update on the timing of your new capacity and I\u2019d appreciate it if you can make some comments on your outlook for heading into some any other supply and just your view on margins over the next 12 months? And then my second question was just related to the 2 billion you announced in terms of additional infrastructure spend related to the Permian, is that included within the 24 billion or is it over the next few years? Can you just clarify that number for me please? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, on the first one in terms of our Chemical business and our investments, obviously \u2013 let me go back to the fundamentals again here. We\u2019ve got from an ethylene demand perspective, we see ethylene growing about 5 million tons per year that will require about three to four world-class crackers per year to be started up. That is \u2013 the objective that we\u2019ve is to compete in that space. And we\u2019re very close to bringing our Baytown crackers online later this year. And then we\u2019re still working the potential greenfield steam cracker development in South Texas which we add another 1.8 million tons per annum of potential capacity. But one of the advantages that we bring to that is, is not only do we have a good source of low cost advantage feed stock but we also have proprietary technologies that offer a premium product. And what I\u2019m speaking to is metallocene polyethylene. So with that demand projection and our ability through our integration and our technology to compete, that is a significant growth area and one that we\u2019re going to talk about next month as well. When you talk about \u2013 I think your other question was around the $2 billion that we discussed in investing in the Permian business, those are really so commensurate with the build-up of the volumes that we showed out to 2025. And there are really two components to it. One is expanding the Wink terminal. We currently have permitted capacity about 100,000 barrels a day at Wink and we\u2019ll expand and commensurate with the growth projection than you see in the prepared remarks I gave. And then the second one is to add additional takeaway capacity and those expenditures would occur over this timeframe of about five years or so. Brendan Warn : Okay. Thanks for the update. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : I guess we can \u2013 since the focus of this call the CapEx increase and I know more will come at the Analyst Day, but as you think about the 50 billion from both an Upstream and a Downstream and Chemical side, what is your \u2013 or what is baked in there in terms of a cost inflation? I just think about when we\u2019ve seen major projects kickoff in a particular area, we always seem to get some of that. And then obviously in the Upstream side we are seeing some cost inflation on the well completion side. So maybe just kind of give us an idea of how you combat that within this big program? Jeff Woodbury : Well, it\u2019s an important aspect to make sure that we deliver on the financial performance of these investments. And when we lay out the projects and specifically individual execution plans for the investments, we\u2019re very mindful about what can we bring to bear in order to really reduce the structural cost of these investments. And if you look over the last couple of years, I think over the last two years, we were able to reduce kind of near-term project inventory cost by about 30% down. And there\u2019s a number of synergies that we\u2019re picking up. We\u2019re applying certain technologies, execution strategies and then we have built all that into our forward projection of investment notably within the long-cycle capital-intensive projects but also as you\u2019ve seen us explain in our short-cycle business how we continue to build that learning curve going forward. So while we always got to be mindful about how these investments can create inflationary pressures, we also detail out these plans to make sure that we\u2019ve put the right mitigators in place and we have strategies that will ensure that we can deliver on the investment expectations. So our view is that we\u2019re going to continue to combat any type of inflationary pressures by these type of cost reduction initiatives that we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last several years. Roger Read : Okay. Thanks for that. And then kind of a follow up of some of the cash flow questions and then obviously the portfolio expansion you\u2019ve done through the various acquisitions and investments here recently. Asset sales relatively light in '17 and I know you don\u2019t guide a specific number for asset sales, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re upgrading the portfolio in terms of future development, should we anticipate over the next couple of years maybe a slightly more aggressive hiving off of some of the more mature assets that are out there, especially thinking with this higher oil price potential buyers are a little more liquid? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, Roger, as you know, we have an ongoing asset management program that\u2019s really designed to identify what assets we should be considering and testing the market with that in order to get greater value for monetizing them from continuing our operations. And if you look over the last five years, we\u2019ve had \u2013 in fact from way back, we\u2019ve had a very active divestment program, very successful divestment program. And if you look at the last five years, we\u2019ve sold over I think it\u2019s like $21 billion, $22 billion of assets in terms of proceeds from those sales which is about $4 billion a year. So in total, 4 billion a year has been about an average for us over an extended period of time. This year it is a little bit light compared to what we have done in the recent past. But we will continue to identify where we can get greater value and upgrade the portfolio. When you think about what we\u2019re actually doing and why we view this asset management program as fundamental of how we manage the business is that on the upside we have a very focused exploration program and we have a targeted inorganic program and acquisition program that\u2019s looking for opportunities that can be accretive to our investment inventory, our portfolio that upgrades the overall portfolio. And you think about things like Guyana and Papua New Guinea and the Jurong Aromatics and Mozambique assets. We\u2019ve bought a lot of stuff at the very top of the portfolio. And concurrent with that, we\u2019re looking at the bottom of the portfolio of things that don\u2019t compete, assets that are late in life and we don\u2019t see material upside and that\u2019s what really sources our ongoing divestment program. Roger Read : No, it\u2019s helpful. I\u2019m just interested if maybe with the churn in terms of new opportunities if that would increase sort of the churn or whatever on the mature scale of things. But it\u2019s helpful and we\u2019ll see you next month. Jeff Woodbury : Thanks, Roger. Operator : We will take our next question from Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez : Hi, Jeff. Good morning. I\u2019ll just use both my questions fairly straightforward on CapEx. For one, I just wanted to go back to 2017. I think the $23 billion number was about $1 billion above your original guidance. And I\u2019m just trying to understand the delta there. Was that kind of activity-based or more inflation than you were expecting or maybe more M&A dollars? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Blake, it was really the last. So if you think about the 23 billion, we had a number of break-ins, but I want to make sure everybody understands that those break-ins were highly accretive to overall financial performance. And as a result, it pushed us up. But if you think just like in the Brazil acquisitions that we picked up, the bid prices in Jurong Aromatics, they both increased the CapEx well above what our plans were and the organization was able to absorb a majority of that through our ongoing blocking and tackling with capital efficiency improvements. There was some reprioritization of some capital plans. But I think the message I want to keep on emphasizing is, is that we have a robust opportunity in inventory of high-quality investments that we think will continue to grow materially long-term value for our shareholders. And as long as we\u2019ve got such a strong inventory investment opportunity, we\u2019re going to continue pursuing. And we\u2019ve taken a full advantage of the down cycle in the market to capture some very attractive assets that are going to upgrade our portfolio. Blake Fernandez : Understood. I guess tying in with that, and this maybe goes back to Neil\u2019s question, but just to understand. It seems like there\u2019s a little bit of a shift in that. I guess your original guidance of 22 billion for '17 contemplated some form of M&A obviously, but now it sounds like going into '18, the 24 billion basically does not. So aside from the Brazil piece of it, I guess should we be thinking that any kind of M&A activity would be additive to that 24 billion? Just looking to confirm that. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So 2017 \u2013 to your point just to be clear, 2017 included although we didn\u2019t advertise at the time, it included the Mozambique acquisition. On top of that, we picked up a number of additional opportunities as I said, Brazil and Jurong Aromatics. As you think about 2018, we always leave a little flexibility in our budget in order to pursue those type of opportunities. You want to make sure that you give yourself some room to go ahead and try to capture those opportunities when they come about. Fundamentally, we\u2019ll go leverage our strong financial capability and balance sheet if something really big comes along and we think it\u2019s going to be accretive for the shareholder. But going forward in the 2018 program, the only thing that is specific, that\u2019s public is the Brazil payment for the farm-in into North Carcara which is round numbers, about $1.3 billion. Blake Fernandez : Understood. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : All right. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thanks. Hi, Jeff. Jeff, you\u2019ve been absent from Brazilian Upstream for a number of years and now a pretty massive shift all at one time into exploration development potential and strategic lines with Petrobras. Can you talk about anything that may have changed in your thoughts around Brazil or is this purely a lot of opportunities just coming up at the same time? And I\u2019ll just ask my second question at the same time. You\u2019ve also picked up a lot of other deepwater exploration acreage just over the last six months or so in Guyana and Mauritania and Ghana. Can you talk about how you\u2019re looking in general at deepwater now competing on the global cost curve? Jeff Woodbury : Sure. On the first one, Jason, in Brazil and I\u2019ll certainly acknowledge that we\u2019ve been absent \u2013 largely absent from Brazil where \u2013 I think we would all recognize has a very strong and rich resource endowment. One of the issues for us over the time, Jason, was that we\u2019re going to invest where we believe the investment dollars are globally competitive. And as Brazil continued to evolve the fiscal reforms, it got to a point where the opportunity coupled with the changes in their reforms made it more attractive for us. And particularly if you think about some of the pre-salt acreage that we picked up, unlike some of the earlier bids, the acreage that we\u2019ve got is covered by a concession contract and not a production sharing contract which just provides a better risk reward balance. So very pleased about the way Brazil has developed and progressed and we think we\u2019ve got a very strong position there now. And as I alluded to previously, we\u2019re going to be very focused to getting after it. The second question is the acreage that we had picked up around the world. It\u2019s fairly obvious to everyone. We\u2019re picking up additional exploration potential. Think about it this way. In terms of how we focus our exploration pursuits, it\u2019s primarily in two key areas. One is where we can get into new play opening opportunities that we see a very high quality potential resource that would compete with global investment opportunities that we believe has a very \u2013 assuming we achieve the objectives of the exploration program, we\u2019ll have a clear path to profitability relative to our other investment opportunities in the portfolio. The second area is where we have existing infrastructure and we see significant high quality potential that we can bring on and start generating revenue pretty quick. When you think about some of the deepwater areas that we\u2019re in, Guyana is a great example. While we\u2019ve had that acreage for a while, some of our technology that we\u2019ve applied to sub-surface imaging has really positioned us well to see things that others historically had not seen there. And you\u2019ve seen the result. We\u2019ve got six very substantial discoveries there and the economics are very robust. At a $40 flat rail, we\u2019re talking about double digit returns. The cost of supply for Guyana is very low. And I think we are \u2013 as with our partners are very well positioned to capitalize on it and we\u2019re leveraging our global deepwater capabilities in doing so. But the same is true in some of these other areas in West Africa, in Cyprus, we\u2019re looking at resources that could be very much on the low side of the cost of supply curve and can compete in a global view that maybe long on supply for a period of time. Jason Gammel : Thanks, Jeff. I appreciate the thoughts. Jeff Woodbury : All right, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria from Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, Jeff. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had one question. On CapEx, obviously you\u2019re increasing investment in the U.S. Could you talk a little bit about the projects which are effectively or the regions are losing competitiveness internally or moving down the priority list? I see the impairments you\u2019ve taken are partly \u2013 it looks like Canadian gas is one of the losers within your portfolio and the impairment shows that. But any color around projects that aren\u2019t going to have less capital going forward will be helpful. Jeff Woodbury : Biraj, I wouldn\u2019t call any area losers. You can think \u2013 rewind back over a decade and we were \u2013 the industry generally view that the U.S. was going to be declining in terms of energy supplies. And you look at \u2013 fast forward to today and look at the abundance that we\u2019ve got. And it\u2019s very relevant to the example that you just highlighted what\u2019s really happened with these non-producing assets within Canada. Well, they\u2019ve become less and less competitive as technology and learning curve benefits have continued to increase substantially the quality and quantity of unconventional resources in the U.S. So as a result we find ourselves in a circumstance where once again technology is going to continue to open up opportunities. So while there may be over certain periods of time maybe areas where you see resource potential or investment dollars declining, I just never short the full potential of technology and what it can bring to additional investment opportunities. As we were just talking per Jason\u2019s question, you see that we\u2019ve got a lot of exploration focus in some of these deepwater areas. Again, we\u2019re trying to fully leverage the full capability of Exxon Mobil\u2019s unique strengths in doing so. But we keep a brief across the whole global portfolio to see if there is anything new that\u2019s coming up. And you\u2019ve seen us going to some places after many years of absence and being very successful there. Biraj Borkhataria : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng : Hi, guys. Good morning. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Jeff, a number of real quick questions. Do you have any \u2013 what\u2019s the asset sales gain in the quarter and in what segment or regions? Jeff Woodbury : So let me start with \u2013 per the press release, the total proceeds in the quarter was $1.4 billion. And most of that, Paul, I\u2019d say about two-thirds of that was in the Upstream, the rest in the Downstream. And I really highlighted what that was in my previous comments. The Upstream is driven by our divestment of our operated assets in Norway, Downstream being driven by the divestment of our retail assets in Norway. If you look at earnings, in the quarter itself, it was just shy of \u2013 it\u2019s about $540 million. Again, primarily split between the Upstream and the Downstream. Paul Cheng : Is it also two-thirds, one-third in terms of earnings? Jeff Woodbury : Well balanced. It\u2019s probably 60/40 Upstream/Downstream. Paul Cheng : Okay, 60/40. And just want to clarify. The Mozambique acquisition, the $2.8 billion, is that in 2017? Does that mean that it closed before the year or it closed after the year-end? Jeff Woodbury : It closed before the year-end. Paul Cheng : Before the year-end, okay. Jeff Woodbury : It\u2019s in the 2017 results. Paul Cheng : Okay. And just curious that for Bakken, you drilled the three-mile \u2013 not exactly three-mile, I think 12,000-feet lateral well. Have you completed or brought that on stream that have any production data? Jeff Woodbury : For the three-mile laterals? Paul Cheng : Yes. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, we don\u2019t have anything sure at this point. We have brought it on stream. They\u2019re working through facility constraints for the facility \u2013 for that region. And I think we\u2019ve got two of the four wells now that are on production but \u2013 like I said, it\u2019s still very early days right now. But I will tell you that they\u2019ve met our pre-drill expectations. Paul Cheng : Jeff, can you tell us that when did they come on stream or how long you already have the data? Jeff Woodbury : It\u2019s not very long, Paul. We\u2019re talking about months. And as I said earlier, we also had this weather downtime notably up in the Bakken. Paul Cheng : Okay. And for the $24 billion on the 2018 CapEx, can you tell us how much is associated with the equity of Eni? Jeff Woodbury : Sorry, the equity of what now? Paul Cheng : The equity of Eni, the non-consulting subsidiaries, because the 24 billion is your total rate including the consulting operation -- Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re talking for Mozambique? Paul Cheng : No. I\u2019m saying that in 2018, you\u2019re CapEx of $24 billion, how much -- Jeff Woodbury : How much is equity companies? Paul Cheng : Yes, equity companies. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Paul, we don\u2019t break that out. Paul Cheng : All right, will do. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Our next question comes from Alistair Syme from Citi. Alastair Syme : Thanks very much. Just a very quick one, Jeff. Can you just explain on the impairments, taking both U.S. and international, I think you said in 3Q that you were revising the oil and gas prices. So I just wanted to clarify what that change was. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, so I talked about it a bit earlier when \u2013 first of all when we go through the process, it really starts through our business planning process, which includes a look at long-term supply and demand and in our planning process, if there\u2019s anything that we see that is a fundamental change that will cause us to do a deeper dive. But one of the things that we have continued to see as a trend has been the substantial growth in commercial resources within the unconventional or within North America and the significant commensurate with that, a significant reduction in the cost of supply. And as a result, when you think about that and the impact it\u2019s going to have longer term, it\u2019s likely to depress longer term gas prices. Now kind of the flipside of all that is, one, that reduces the cost of energy. Also, that technology has, as I said, driven down the cost side of it. So it\u2019s a matter of making sure that you\u2019re pursuing the most competitive assets. And then when you think about some of these Canadian assets I referenced, they just don\u2019t compete like they used to at this point. And as a result, we took the decision not to progress any more development planning activity and write them off. Alastair Syme : Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Jeff Woodbury : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP. Theepan Jothilingam : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Two quick questions. Firstly, just in terms of coming back to the cash flow number for the quarter, just objectively, are there any particular sort of one-offs or seasonal factors? I know it\u2019s difficult just to extrapolate one quarter into sort of annual performance but I just want to know if there was any sort of cash taxes that were higher than a typical quarter or not. Second question, you\u2019re growing that retail business in Mexico. I just want to understand where you think the position can get to or what are the ambitions for Exxon in Mexico in the Downstream? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Theepan, there\u2019s really nothing that is mentionable with respect to our cash flow in the quarter itself other than these kind of one-offs that were \u2013 and it\u2019s an accumulation of a bunch of one-off, other earnings events that had a negative impact on earnings and therefore cash flow as well. But I will be the first to admit. Those happen throughout the year as well. So there\u2019s nothing that I would point to, other than the impact from the tax reform that had the effects that we\u2019ve already talked about on the other balance sheet items that I would be able to talk to. Theepan Jothilingam : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : On Mexico, we went ahead and, I believe in the fourth quarter, we opened eight Mobil branded stations. We\u2019ve got plans to go ahead and open up another 50 sites by the end of the first quarter. I think it\u2019s important that Exxon Mobil is participating in Mexico on an integrated basis using our global refining capacity to supply the Mexican fuel demand. I believe we did announce that we\u2019ve got plans to invest about $300 million in logistics, product inventories, and marketing over the next decade. But I think it provides another good opportunity and outlet for our refined products. Theepan Jothilingam : Okay. Thanks very much, Jeff. See you next month. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Hi, guys. Just one from me. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been touched on yet. A lot of headlines over the last 10 days or so regarding the Groningen field. And I wanted to get your understanding of what the JV will be able to produce at Groningen in the course of 2018 beyond the output cap that went into effect this past October. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, right now, as you know, NAM, which is the operator, is continuing to operate under the current cap at 21.6 cubic meters. We clearly understand the concerns of the people that are experiencing these tremors and the related damage. We respect the government\u2019s efforts to go in and address valid concerns. In terms of how NAM will respond to that, it\u2019s really \u2013 they\u2019re probably best to go ahead and address the matter. We continue to provide technical support to them. But I think if the cap, the current 21.6 stays in effect through the full year, Pavel, it would impact our 2018 volumes by about 40 million cubic feet a day lower than 2017. But, of course, as you probably saw on the recent announcement, the government is thinking about modifying that. Pavel Molchanov : Okay, clear enough. Appreciate it. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob West with Redburn. Rob West : Hi. Thanks, Jeff. There\u2019s two shorter term questions I wanted to ask you. The first one is thank you for the breakdown of the production effects between divestments and PSCs and decline. I was wondering on the decline component, can you touch on whether the assets, particularly Africa and Asia, the weaker areas, are seeing any decline that\u2019s above the level you\u2019d expected or in line? And that is in the context of I think some of your peers are seeing lower declines generally because of digitization and reliability drives, because I was wondering where you were on that. That\u2019s my first one. Jeff Woodbury : Yes, Rob, it\u2019s a great question because we monitor that very closely. And I\u2019d say, by and large, over the last year we\u2019ve been able to mitigate some of the natural field decline in a number of fields through very solid reservoir management, artificial lift improvement, changes to how we manage the assets, reliability. But, by and large, we\u2019ve managed that very well and been able to offset those declines. So nothing in excess of what we would expect at this point. Rob West : Okay. That sounds like good news. On the second question, back to what Brendan was asking about on the Chemical side, the long-term view is clear. I was wondering more on the short term. I guess what we\u2019ve got, particularly in the U.S., is quite a large number of start-ups really bunched together quite quickly. And I hear you on the long term of the market but particularly this quarter, you had big growth in volumes and with that, a slight weakening of margins. Do you see any short-term margin impacts as those big volumes ramp up? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of that prior comment you made, whether it\u2019s a long-term comment or whether we should brace for some short-term margin impacts as the ramp-ups come? Jeff Woodbury : Well, Rob, there\u2019s always the possibility of short-term volatility. No doubt about it. I mean, if you think about \u2013 break it down to some elements, the olefins, polyolefins, demand growth has been very robust. But there are going to be some capacity start-ups here over the next two years or so that could have some implications. But what you\u2019ve got to do is you\u2019ve got to have the lowest cost of operation and you have to have a very high-value and appreciated product to sell. And if you look at our metallocene product sales, we\u2019ve been growing at a much greater escalation than the demand growth for chemicals. But each one of these products, we pay very close attention to it. And our investment premise has primarily been based on our long-term expectation in terms of growth. And then you build the portfolio to be robust by lowering your feedstock flexibility, taking full advantage \u2013 for Exxon Mobil, taking full advantage of the lower cost structure from the integration between our chemical and our refining operations. And then, as I said, fully leverage our technology in order to provide a high-value product that the market appreciates and has a pull on. Rob West : Okay, great. Thank you. Look forward to asking some long-term ones at the strategy update. Jeff Woodbury : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Herrlin from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John Herrlin : Yes, just two quick ones. With Liza Phase 2, are you going to own the FPSO or lease? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, John, that\u2019s to be determined. John Herrlin : Okay, that\u2019s fine. And then with respect to the horizontal wells in the Midland, three-mile wells take a while to clean up. Can you give us a sense of how long it does take to clean up a well that long? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I really don\u2019t have anything to share at this point. It\u2019s still pretty early days on the start-up for these wells. I know there\u2019s a lot of interest as a result of us pushing further and further out. But I will tell you that all of the technical work that we have done, the modeling, et cetera, in order to justify the incremental value proposition that we\u2019re to get from these longer laterals that these wells so far are performing as expected, in terms of execution and initial rates. But when we get to the point where we\u2019ve got some good data that we feel like is appropriate, we\u2019ll go ahead and share it at that point. John Herrlin : Okay. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome, John. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodbury for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Woodbury : Well, as always, I really do appreciate your interest, your engagement, and your very thoughtful questions. And as I noted earlier that we\u2019re looking forward to having a good conversation next month at our Analyst Meeting. And we do have in sights a very aggressive plan to drive our value growth and intend to give more clarity around what that looks like, in terms of what it is, how we\u2019re going to do it, and why it is important to the corporation and to our shareholders. So, again, I appreciate your interest and we look forward to seeing you next month. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead sir. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings call. My comments this morning will refer to the slides that are available through the Investors section of our website. Consistent with our recent Analyst Meeting, you'll note additional detail in our press release and this morning's prepared comments. Our objective is to provide clarity on key business drivers in the quarter and describe progress being made to deliver on value growth potential outlined in the Analyst Meeting. In the interest of time, I\u2019ll move through the prepared material efficiently to ensure there is sufficient time for your questions. While we go further, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on Slide 2. Please also see the supplemental information included in today's presentation. Turning now to Slide 3, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines of our first quarter performance. Exxon Mobil earned $4.7 billion in the quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $10 billion, the highest since 2014. Importantly, cash flow exceeded net investments in the business, distributions and other financing activities by almost $3 billion. In the United States, we achieved positive Upstream earnings of about $430 million. In Papua New Guinea, facility shut in resulting from the earthquake reduced this quarter's earnings by about $80 million in volumes by 25,000 oil current barrels per day. We've since resumed production and expect to reach full capacity in early May. As I\u2019ll discuss shortly, we made good progress during the quarter in a number of areas that will support our value growth potential. Moving to Slide 4, we provide an overview of financial results. As indicated, the Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings were $4.7 billion or $1.09 per share up 16% from the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $10 billion including $1.4 billion in proceeds from asset sales that I'll discuss shortly. In the quarter, Corporation distributed $3.3 billion in dividends to our shareholders. Our CapEx was $4.9 billion up 17% from the prior year quarter resulting increased activity in the Permian consistent with our growth plans. Debt was down to $40.6 billion at the end of the quarter and cash increased to $4.1 billion. Next slide provides a high-level look at the key drivers for these business results. Upstream, we benefited from higher realizations for both liquids and natural gas. However, our liquid realizations rose less in the benchmark prices due to widening of the Canadian heavy oil discount. These higher prices resulted in lower volume entitlements. Production was also reduced by downtime in the quarter and divestment of assets. We\u2019re continuing to progress growth initiatives as outlined in our Analyst Meeting including increased drilling in the Permian, advancing attractive new projects and completing maintenance activities, enhance performance over existing assets. Finally, we're actively strengthening our portfolio to the acquisition of new assets such as exploration acreage offshore Brazil. We also captured incremental value through divestments of assets. Refining margins remain strong in the Downstream especially in North America. However, joint product demand was seasonally lower. U.S. manufacturing reliability recovered from the fourth quarter and notably Joliet returned to full capacity in March. We also continue to make progress in growing our chemical business. Integration of the Jurong Aromatics plant into our existing Singapore business is progressing as planned. In North America sales are increasing with the ramp-up of the new polyethylene lines at Mont Belvieu supplying the growing demand for petroleum products. Within our base business we successfully completed turnarounds in the Middle East and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The next slide provides additional detail on sources of cash. Earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our ongoing asset management program yielded $10 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. A positive adjustment for working capital mainly reflects favorable seasonal changes in payables which were partly offset by an inventory build in the Downstream business mostly due to maintenance. Negative adjustment for other balance sheet items reflects timing of equity company distributions. Asset sales included Upstream properties, notably the Scarborough gas field and Downstream distribution and retail assets. Note that, cash flow was higher than the prior quarter largely due to the higher earnings. Moving to Slide 7, I\u2019ll describe the uses of cash. Over the quarter, our cash balance increased from $3.2 billion to $4.1 billion. From a cash flow, we made shareholder distributions of $3.3 billion and confirmed our commitment to reliably grow the dividend. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.82 per share representing a 6.5% increase from last quarter and marking our 36th consecutive year of per share dividend growth. Net investments in the business were $3.3 billion lower than the prior quarter due to the absence of acquisition payments. Debt and other financing items decreased cash by about $2.5 billion. This included $1.9 billion in debt repayment and $425 million used to purchase 5 million shares to offset dilution related to benefit plans and programs. In the second quarter of 2018, Exxon Mobil will limit share purchases to amounts needed to offset dilution related to our benefit plans and programs. Moving to Slide 8 for a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings of $4.7 billion increased $918 million from the previous quarter excluding the fourth quarter impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Upstream earnings increased about $980 million primarily due to higher prices. Downstream earnings decreased $12 million driven by weaker refining margins. Chemical business increased earnings by $76 million primarily due to lower operating expenses. These were all partly offset by higher expenses in corporate and financing segment due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher pension expenses. Our total corporate and financing charges for the quarter were about $800 million. After further evaluation of the full impact of the U.S. tax reform, we expect these expenses to range between $700 million and $900 million per quarter for the remaining of 2018. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 40%, reflecting a higher proportion of non-U.S. Upstream earnings. Looking at the remainder of the year, we expect the effective tax rate to range between 30% and 40% at current commodity prices and the current portfolio mix. The increase in guidance is driven by Upstream's higher proposition of earnings. Moving to Slide 9 for a comparison to the prior year quarter. Exxon Mobil's first quarter earnings increased $640 million from the year ago quarter driven by higher upstream realizations. This is partly offset by lower downstream earnings resulting from lower asset, management gains, and lower volumes to the higher maintenance in the U.S. Chemical earnings decreased due to lower margins and corporate and financing charges reduced earnings by another $270 million again due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and higher expenses. Moving to Slide 10, we\u2019ll highlight some of the progress we've made over the first quarter that supports our growth plan shared at the Analyst Meeting. We made our 7th discovery on the Stabroek block enabled by our proprietary subsurface imaging technology. Oil well encountered 65 feet of high-quality oilbearing sandstone. Oil will be developed in conjunction with the giant Payara field along with other development phases this will help bring Guyana's total production potential to more than 500,000 barrels per day. Common activities are on Liza Phase 1 and are progressing well. The Stena Carron is currently drilling Liza 5 appraisal well which will help to delineate the greater Liza resource. A well test is planned at Liza 5 and will begin shortly. After the completion of the test, the rig will return to the Turbot area to drill a delineation well named Longtail. Previously indicated, we mobilized the second rig to the basin which drove the exploration well Suburban [ph] in advance of the start of development drilling for Liza Phase I. Suburban well reached total debt this week but failed to encounter commercial quantities for hydrocarbons. We have additional exploration drilling planned later this year as we continue to explore the full potential of the Stabroek block. In Papua New Guinea, resource assessment certified an 84% increase in the size of the P'nyang field, more than 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. These resources support our discussions with joint-venture partners regarding a three train expansion concept for the PNG LNG facility. One train will be dedicated the gas from P'nyang and two trains will be dictated to gas associated with the Papua LNG project. This development concept would add approximately 8 million tons per annum doubling capacity over existing plant. As planned, we continue to increase our U.S. tied oil activity. We currently have 27 operated horizontal rigs in the Permian and four operated rigs in the Bakken. We remain focused on maximizing capital efficiency, drilling wells that are consistently longer than the industry average. Total unconventional production in the Permian and Bakken has increased by 18% versus the first quarter of 2017 with strong well performance supported by optimized completions. With respect to our portfolio, we added 8 new box offshore Brazil which I will talk about shortly and signed agreements for deepwater blocks, offshore Ghana and Namibia. As indicated, we continue to monetize assets including a 50% interest in the Stabroek gas field. We also closed several downstream divestments including distribution and marketing assets in South America and retail sites in Europe. Further portfolio highgrading remains a priority. In the chemical segment, we continue to be focused on increasing capacity to meet growing demand for higher value chemical products. We began commissioning our ethylene cracker in Baytown Texas with startup plan midyear. This will enhance integration to lower feedstock costs for the associated polyethylene lines that started up in the fourth quarter of 2017. Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on Slide 11. First quarter Upstream earnings were $3.5 billion, an increase of about $980 million from the last quarter excluding the fourth quarter 2017 impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Realizations increased earnings by $640 million, crude prices rose just over $3 per barrel versus last quarter but less than benchmark prices due to the widening of the Canadian heavy oil discount. Gas realizations increased $0.80 per thousand cubic feet. Volume mix effects decreased earnings by $130 million primary drivers for this with the effect two fewer days in the quarter, higher downtime and lower entitlements partly offset by project growth and seasonal gas demand. All other items increased earnings $470 million largely due to lower operating expenses and positive net asset sales. Upstream unit profitability for the quarter was $10.30 per barrel excluding the impact of non-controlling interest volumes. Moving to Slide 12, oil equivalent production in the quarter was 3.9 million barrels per day a decrease of 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Liquids production decreased 35,000 barrels per day as downtime in Canada, lower entitlements and divestment of our Norway operated assets more than offset growth from new projects and work programs. In particular we were pleased with initial results at Hebron where performance for the new wells have exceeded expectation. Natural gas production decreased about 400 million cubic feet per day due to lower entitlements and downtime notably in Papua New Guinea. This was partly offset by higher seasonal gas demand and project growth volumes. Moving to Slide 13 for a comparison to the prior year quarter, first quarter upstream earnings increased $1.2 billion due to higher realizations. Crude prices rose $10.80 per barrel versus the year ago quarter and gas realizations increased $0.90 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $190 million lower entitlements and increase downtime specifically in Papua New Guinea were partly offset by project volume growth. All other items increased earnings $10 million as net gains from asset sales were offset by higher operating expenses. Moving to Slide 14 oil equivalent production decreased 6% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Liquid production was down 117,000 barrels per day due to field decline in the fourth quarter divestment of our operated assets in Norway and lower entitlements partly offset by new project volumes. Natural gas production decreased 870 million cubic feet per day driven by higher downtime, lower entitlements and a decline in the U.S. This is partly offset by project and work program volumes. Turning to Slide 15 we\u2019ll provide an update on earthquake recovery efforts in Papua New Guinea. First and foremost on behalf of Exxon Mobil and in particular our staff in Papua New Guinea I want to extent our thoughts and well wishes to the people of PNG as recovery continues falling the devastation brought by this powerful earthquake and its aftershocks. Sponsor and initial earthquake all of our production gathering pipeline and processing facilities were safely shutdown. Exxon Mobil's humanitarian response to-date is included to distribution of food, water, emergency, shelters and other supplies along with the transportation of medics into affected areas. We focus support of the most impacted remote communities may bring our operations and have also made a donation to relief agencies. Our facilities successfully withstood the magnitude 7.5 earthquake in late February and its aftershocks due in large part a robust design and the immediate and effective response by our people. As of its location we accounted for a wide range of seismic activity in the original design, engineering and construction of the PNG/LNG project. In mid-April ahead of our projected recovery timeframe we announced a safe resumption of LNG production the second LNG train started up this week and the facility is wrapping up to full capacity. LNG exports have also resumed. During the period that production was shutdown we also brought forward and completed maintenance store facilities that was planned for later this year enabling more efficient operations in the months ahead. We proud of the response of our people in managing this extreme event and importantly churn for the community. On Slide 16 we take a closer look at ExxonMobil's current acreage position offshore Brazil which positions us with significant high quality resource potential. You\u2019ll recall that last year we captured several attractive opportunities including a combined farm and bid round award for the discovered undeveloped Carcara field which extends across both the BM-S-8 and North Carcara blocks. Carcara field contains an estimated recoverable resource of more than 2 billion barrels for which the co-venture group is progressing development planning activities. Groups near-term plans include up to three wells in the field better delineate the resource and deploying the development concept. As we shared at the analyst meeting this proposed development yields attractive returns even at crude prices of $40 per barrel. At bid round 15 held last month we were awarded an additional eight deepwater blocks containing multibillion barrel prospects in the pre-salt play taking our total acreage to more than 2 million acres across 24 blocks. ExxonMobil operates more than 60% of these acreage holdings and we will leverage our capabilities and proprietary technologies maximize potential resource value. We will be acquiring more than 19,000 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data in 2018. As we already have 3-D seismic of some of the blocks we\u2019re also progressing plans for the first exploration well scheduled for the latter part of next year. Moving to Slide 17 we\u2019ll now discuss downstream financial and operating results. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $940 million a decrease of 12 million from the previous quarter excluding the fourth quarter 2017 impacts of U.S. tax reform and impairments. Global refining margins decreased earnings by $200 million unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $40 million mainly due to lower seasonal demand and higher maintenance activity partly offset by improved operations in the U.S. All other items increased earnings by $230 million mainly driven by lower operating expenses partly offset by the absence of last quarter's Norway retail divestment. Moving now to Slide 18 downstream earnings decreased to 176 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Margins were down 30 million due to lower non-U.S. margins partly offset by higher margins in the U.S. Unfavorable volume and mix effects decreased earnings by $60 million due to continued higher U.S. maintenance activity mostly at Joliet which resumed full capacity in March. All other items reduced earnings by $90 million mainly due to do the absence of asset management gains from last year's Canadian port credit asset sales. Moving now to chemical financial and operating results on Slide 19, first quarter chemical earnings were about more than $1 billion up 76 million versus the previous quarter excluding fourth quarter 2017 impacts from newest tax reform. Weaker margins and lower volumes primarily due to turnaround activity negatively impacted earnings by $30 million each. Lower operating expenses and favorable impacts from foreign exchange increased earnings by $140 million. Turning to Slide 20 first quarter chemical earnings were down $160 million compared to the prior year quarter. Weaker margins resulted in a decrease in earnings of 270 million as increase feedstock costs outpaced stronger realizations. Higher product sales from our new chemical operations in Singapore and the U.S. improved earnings by $120 million All other items in the quarter included higher expenses related to new operations and other growth opportunities which were mostly offset by favorable foreign exchange effects. These growth opportunities are key the component of our plans detailed at the Analyst Meeting. Now turning to our final slide, corporations focused on growing value across our integrated businesses. Each of our businesses contributed to solid financial performance in the quarter together earning $4.7 billion. Cash flow from operations and asset sales of 10 billion covered our net investments and dividends with free cash flow of $6.7 billion. Upstream production volumes were 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day in line with our expectations. We expect second quarter volumes to be lower due to seasonal gas demand and then growth in the second half with project entitlement volumes, seasonal demand and volume benefits from accelerated maintenance completed in the first quarter. Total CapEx was $4.9 billion with no change to your guidance. Strengthened, the Upstream portfolio to exploration, acreage capture and selected divestments as well as disciplined execution for our investment program. In the Downstream we are progressing our advantage investments such as those in Rotterdam and Antwerp manufacture higher value products capitalizing our proprietary technology and integration. And in the chemical business we\u2019re focused on growing sales of our differentiated products supported by new assets that are well-positioned to meet global demand growth. Finally, we remain committed to our shareholders as demonstrated by 36 consecutive years of dividend increases. That concludes my prepared remarks, before we turn to your questions I\u2019d like to note that in the remaining quarters of this year one of our management members will participate in the call to provide further perspective on progress and key developments relative to our plans. Chairman and CEO will participate in the fourth quarter. With that I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sam Margolin with Cowen & Company. Sam Margolin : I guess just to start on the overall profitability spectrum. At the Analyst Day you offered a pretty clear view that the Upstream contributions would be you know after the post-2020 long cycle development program is wrapping up and in the interim Downstream and Chemicals would carry a lot of earnings growth. I understand the slides clarified that the margin environment wasn't necessarily supportive of that in 1Q, but maybe just an update on how those two segments are performing in an apples to apples margin picture and sort of what the fundamental outlook looks like for the remainder of the year and into that 2020 period where Upstream starts to contribute more? Jeff Woodbury : Yes Sam good question, and thanks for taking us back to what are our plans as we detailed in the analyst meeting. As you may recall let me take each of them separately in the Downstream, we are making - we have been making very strategic investments in order to high-grade our products. I highlighted in my prepared comments Antwerp and Rotterdam which is going to take us out of lower value products into higher value products. We\u2019ll have Antwerp that will start up in the middle of the year and then Rotterdam will start up by the end of the year okay. As well in the Downstream, we have continued to expand our entry into some high growth areas such as Mexico and Indonesia everything is moving consistent with the plans that we laid out in the analyst meeting. On the Chemical side, same story we had laid out for you a plan of growth commensurate with what we saw in terms of chemical products. Importantly, as I indicated in the prepared comments that the Baytown cracker will be starting up middle of this year it is the really the second half of the overall project remember the first half being the two polyethylene lines in Mont Belvieu which have started up and have been wrapping up to full capacity and that will add a significant additional comp on it to our chemical portfolio. You also recall there are a number of other investments that we made in chemicals in Singapore importantly but we are making great progress on integration of our Jurong Aromatics acquisition. But we see significant value there and as the organization continues to integrate that into our big Singapore manufacturing facilities we continue to see additional opportunity but right now the focus on Singapore and Jurong Aromatics primarily the integration and capturing the synergies that we saw. I leave it there unless you have more questions on it. Sam Margolin : No that\u2019s all right I assume they\u2019ll be more later in the Q&A. My follow-up is on Upstream. I wonder if we could dig in a little bit on these entitlement effects, specifically they were a little bit accelerated from 4Q even though the oil price move was actually somewhat more substantial in 4Q versus 1Q. I know there is a lot of nuances in these contracts and some of them are subject to some nondisclosures and confidentiality. But anything we could glean on the forward look for these entitlements and maybe some future impacts maybe decelerating here considering the quarter-over-quarter increase in that piece of the production number? Jeff Woodbury : Yes, I mean you\u2019re highlighting an important issue that has historically been a key criteria on how our overall volumes play out. I mean if you go back and look at just sequential analysis versus last quarter it was over 90,000 barrels a day that impacted us. And as you appropriately recognize each of these contracts that we have that have entitlement volumes are very unique. They are really a function of the commercial structure, the expenditure level and obviously prices. Now the good news side just don't lose sight of the fact that if you have an acid that is not cause current that just means accelerated recovery sooner. But it's hard for us to convey specific guidance given the unique aspects of - each of these contracts. But if you just think about what you\u2019ve seen sequentially 90,000 barrels a day and you think about it quarter on quarter which I believe is around 70,000 barrels a day. It can have a material impact, but remember what our fundamental objective here is to really manage the business to maximize the value proposition. And that\u2019s what most important here and as I said on the volumes going forward you can really think about our volumes contributions in 2018 coming from the areas that I mentioned you know our project growth notably in places like Hebron, Odoptu and Upper Zakum the title oil growth that we\u2019ve been advertising, but we\u2019re making great progress. We said that we\u2019d be there at about 30 rigs by the end of this year. We\u2019re already at 27 rigs so we\u2019re really ahead of schedule. The second piece that you got to remember is that, as I alluded to there has been a number of unplanned downtime events in the first quarter and we went ahead and took advantage to accelerate scheduled downtime that we have in the latter part of this year into that first quarter to be more efficient and the downtime on the facility notably in Papua New Guinea as I reference and the second area in Syncrude. So we took full advantage of the opportunity to optimize the business and we\u2019ll, as a result, have more efficient operations in the second half of the year, won't have those planned events, and therefore, we will get some volume recovery. The third thing that you'll recall is, as I mentioned is in the second half of the year, we'll start seeing that seasonal demand start ticking-up on this again. And then, lastly, I'll mention and I didn't say in my prepared comments, but we always have a very robust conventional work program and we're -- those are fairly cheap high value barrels that we're able to capture through the propane. Operator : We will go next to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Todd : And I would like to pass along things not just for the incremental disclosure, but I think the addition of management team members to the call to be welcomed going forward by investors, so that's great. And the first one from me would maybe on Groningen and again one of your partners wrote off reserves and booked an impairment of Groningen associated with the recent government announcement there. Can you speak to your thoughts here going forward, as well as maybe help frame what the potential impact would be or -- and whether you view there being a possibility of any compensation going forward? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Well, I mean, as you can appreciate, it is a very dynamic situation. We continue in discussions with NAM, the operator and the government. Those are confidential discussions. Really Ryan at this stage we just don't want to speculate until we conclude those discussions. But we're still operating, the field is still operating under the current cap of 21.6 billion cubic meters per year. Ryan Todd : Okay. And maybe a follow-up on Canada, I know you brought forward some of the turnaround there at Syncrude. But can you talk about your availability to get Canadian heavy out of there, I mean, how are you seeing when Syncrude comes back, are you anticipating limits on your ability to get it out, is it -- are you moving things on, how much on rail versus pipe and how much you're able to run through your refineries to capture the benefit there? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. You have really covered some of the answer there. In the first quarter we did experience some constraints due to logistics. It was about 12,000 barrels a day in the quarter itself. If you think about going forward, right now we're able to clear all the barrels. Importantly, if you think back in the prior discussions, one of the objectives that we've continued to press within our business is maintain logistic flexibility. Several years ago we went ahead and tested by way of example in Edmonton Rail Terminal that gives us another export option. Obviously, we've got pipeline capacity that we can leverage. And then, importantly, as you point out is that, we're also trying to capture the full value chain benefits by bringing the heavy oil into our own equity pass beyond on refining. But we will -- we continue to find them the best value option for us in order to deliver those barrels to market. So it's all about making sure that we're looking well ahead of the issue and identifying how do we maximize that flexibility, either take it into our equity, capacity in our manufacturing footprint or to export it to capture a greater value. Operator : We will go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Again, Jeff, thanks for the incremental disclosure, but I think there is still some confusion out there on what's really going on in the operating cash flow. So I wonder if I could trouble you to just walk through the dynamics of the net PP&E odds, what is the timing of affiliate distributions and reconcile that with net income plus DD&A, which is $9.2 billion. You see what I mean there is the CapEx of the affiliate level, as I understand, is reported on a net basis above the operating line, if you could confirm that and just walk through the delta, because I think folks think that your cash flow number was closer to $8.2 billion. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. So our -- if you look at our net PP&E it was $3.3 billion and that reflects -- that's absent the cash requirements for affiliates, okay. Doug Leggate : Right. Jeff Woodbury : And that is down versus both the prior quarter, fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the prior year quarter, primarily due to the absence of acquisition funding. Doug Leggate : Just on that point did you pay for Brazil in the first quarter? Jeff Woodbury : In the first quarter -- what\u2019s specific Brazil, there has been a number of transactions? Doug Leggate : The Carcara acquisition, that was the money outdoor in the first quarter for Carcara? Jeff Woodbury : Not yet Doug Leggate : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : That is to come later this year. Doug Leggate : All right. But your net capital spend after affiliates are the -- below the operating cash flow line was $3.3 billion, is that number we should be looking at. Jeff Woodbury : That's correct. Doug Leggate : Okay. Great. Thank. My follow-up is, obviously, you said in your commentary about the Sorubim-1 successful well. When we met with you a couple weeks ago my cousins had made a comment that in a success case there could be a third rig option because of the potentially open another play type. Has that option now gone away, is that play type now abandoned or does just condemned that upside exploration case or maybe you could just frame how these changes the rest profile of the block and I'll leave it there. Thanks. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Sure. I mean, let me just characterize, I mean, Sorubim, like any exploration program there is a fair degree of risk in all these exploration prospects. As I've indicated previously, every time we drill one of these well, we pick up some additional insight of learning\u2019s and I wouldn\u2019t say that the well in itself would condemn the play or the prospect opportunities that we've got in Stabroek Block. As it relates to the potential of the third rig, Doug, I would tell you that that is always a possibility, but we will make that decision based on the technical maturity of our prospects as we integrate the real time data that we get things from Sorubim, from Liza-5, and other analysis that we're doing based on that 3D seismic that we went hit and took. Right now we've got, the plan is to go ahead and run the two rigs in parallel. One primarily focusing on the development wells for Liza Phase 1 following the completion of the Liza Phase --Liza-5 well test and in the second we will be following up on some prior discoveries and again we will think about how we modify that rig line based on how we mature the technical prospects. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : First question is actually a little bit of follow-up to Doug\u2019s question, you noted the equity affiliates headwind in the quarter of a $1 billion. Certainly appreciate you breaking that out from the working capital. So just wondering how you think about that number for the full year and one of your peers, for example, has said that the affiliates will be a $2 billion headwind on an annual basis, I know it\u2019ll be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, so just any additional color you can provide there. Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, so, I mean, if you think about the equity companies. I mean, obviously, a big part of the $1 billion that we think about it, I mean, that's typically a seasonal pattern for us, okay. Usually we don't see those distributions until later in the year if that's what you're trying to get your hands around. Phil Gresh : Yes. That was definitely part of it. It did sound a seasonal on the quarter, but I was wondering on an annualized basis also is it, you kind of lumped together a number of factors\u2026 Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Phil Gresh : \u2026 and your disclosures in your filings, I just wonder if that affiliate headwinds on an annual basis which still be headwind. Jeff Woodbury : We think, I mean, broadly speaking without giving you a specific numbers, Phil, I would tell you that most all the earnings are distributed throughout the year. Phil Gresh : Okay. So more of the one to one, I guess, is what you're saying? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. I mean\u2026 Phil Gresh : Earnings to cash\u2026 Jeff Woodbury : \u2026 broadly speaking, I mean, it is going to be some timing impacts depending on cash requirements from the equity companies. Phil Gresh : Yes. Okay. Thanks. Second question would just be one of your peers has also given helpful statistic around base plus shale CapEx. So, I was wondering if there is some kind of framework with underlying your capital spending numbers, you might be able to provide around base plus shale given that for you guys it\u2019s essentially going to drive flat production for the long-term. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. I think from our prior discussions, Phil, what you really were looking at was capital efficiency. And we clearly pay close attention to that versus how we expect we should perform, as well as how our peers are managing this important area. And our conclusion continues to be that, we lead in that area. Now we don\u2019t think comfort in that only because we think we get always do better. But as you think about how we conclude that it\u2019s through a number of things. One I would say that the ultimate measure of that is our return on capital employed and not only we do lead on return on capital employed, we've laid out a very attractive investment program that shows how we\u2019re going to continue to grow that lead out to 2025. We also have looked at what some are spending annually and while we have a much bigger production base. Our expenditure levels are comfortable on an absolute basis. And lastly, I would say, if you look at another measure and to me it's really simple one. Take your total capital employed per barrel crude reserves, in other words the money spent developed the reserves. We have one of the lowest dollars per barrel out there. So, I mean, if the objective is to really try to qualify the capital efficiency of our business that's what I would offer to you. Operator : We go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Neil. Neil Mehta : Jeff, when do you think you'll be in a position of the company to make it FID decision around PNG, and then the -- any update on Qatar in the latest in terms of both the timeline and progress around negotiation there? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Neil, on the first one regarding the PNG, I mean, as I indicated in my prepared comments, I mean, we have clearly made some really good progress. And if I could just go ahead and recap for the group, we did the Interoil acquisition, significant resource at Elk and Antelope, which is right along the pipeline route from the Highlands to plants, so very clear synergies and opportunities. Total operates those assets and we've been in very close coordination with our existing co-ventures and Total, and as I indicated in prepared comments, I think, we\u2019re aligning on this expansion. In addition to that, two other things to note, one is that we continue to make significant resource -- additional resource captures with, like I mentioned, P'nyang, earlier this year or last year we went ahead and made good discovery at Muruk, and we have got a well that was spud there later this year and we think there is, it\u2019s very significant, very close to the Hides gas field. And then the last point I would make is that picked a lot of good exploration high quality acreage in the Highlands, obviously, through the Interoil and then offshore of the LNG plant. So the message in all that is that we have built a very sizable high quality resource potential in the PNG vicinity and that positions us with this expansion, as well as maybe potential opportunities. In terms of the timing, that is yet to be determined, obviously, there are a lot of different players in this and ultimately the resource owner, the PNG government needs to align with the plants and the timing of that. But I just say that, I think, it is very well-positioned. I think the project in itself has demonstrated outstanding performance and I think the earthquake recovery is just another yet example of quality of the people that we got there and the asset itself. And then as you go forward, I think, we\u2019re very well-positioned to compete as one of the lowest cost of supply providers of gas in that market. So we've got a full focused effort to make sure that PNG is so executed consistent with its history of the best-in-class performance. The timing when we get closer obviously we\u2019ll go ahead and provide a more specific timeline for you. On Qatar, broadly speaking we value that partnership that we've got with the Qataris. We view that is yet again another very successful venture where both parties brought some value to the arrangement and you step back many years later and you look Qatar being one of the largest LNG exporters, again very low cost of supply and we\u2019re very proud of the role that we played in that. We participated in 12 of the 14 trains. We brought some very important technology to play like big LNG trains and the big LNG carriers, and we want to continue that relationship. And you seen us partner with the Qataris in places like Brazil and Cyprus, and we\u2019ll continue to find opportunities where we collectively leverage our mutual experiences and capabilities to go ahead and build our portfolio and ultimately drive that into value for both the Qatar and Exxon Mobil. Neil Mehta : Jeff, a quick modeling question here, in the Analyst Day deck you provided some cash flow levels at 60/80 Brent levels. What\u2019s the rule of thumb, every dollar change in the price of Brent was that due to the Exxon Mobil cash flow? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. We have the earnings sensitivity that's in our 10-K and it\u2019s -- for every dollar per barrel it's about $500 million of earnings per barrel -- of cash per barrel. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore. Doug Terreson : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : The dividend increase of 7%, while pretty similar to the growth rate and the median during the past 10 years and 20 years it\u2019s pretty significant I think. And on this point when considering the new financial disclosure that Darren is going to be on the call later in the year and it returns targets. There has been lot of positive change at the company this year at least in my opinion. So my question is, what is the company trying to convey from the size of the dividend increase if anything and if there is new underlying message from this change or some of the other changes we seen this year what is it. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Well, Doug thanks for the question. I mean, simply put, remember we keep -- we\u2019re keeping very focused on our core mission and that is to grow shareholder value. I mean there is an intense focus by the corporation on value growth, okay. And part of if you think about our capital allocation approach fundamentally what we said was one of the first priority is growing shareholder value and distributing that success to our shareholders through our dividend and you\u2019ve seen us s for 36 consecutive years continue to grow that that dividend. And I think when you look at what the Board's decision was earlier this week, it was really underpinned by the confidence that we've got in our business plan. And we made a decision given a number of factors that coalesce to be much clearer in terms of where we saw that value growth potential. And frankly, Doug, I would tell you, because we believe that the investment community did not have a very good understanding of what our value growth potential was. Doug Terreson : Yeah. Jeff Woodbury : And we believe it was important to go ahead and make that much clearer. And I can tell you that every one of the senior leadership that are running these businesses are committed to delivering that value potential. Now a key aspect of that is making sure that we are being very thoughtful and selective in growing that investment program that is going to generate that accretive value. But ultimately all these steps are around a simple message of value growth and making sure that that is clearly understood by the investment community as to where we\u2019re going and that we think ultimately it's differentiated by our technology, by the integration of our businesses that add additional value that we believe is sustainable. And I think as we go through this year and into next year, and you see us delivering on those expectations, I think, ultimately, I think, people are going to have much more understanding, better understanding of what the full scope potential this corporation has, notably from the integration of our three world-class businesses. Doug Terreson : Okay. Well, Jeff, your tone surely underscores your enthusiasm towards the new value proposition, that's a good thing. And then I had another question, what was the earnings impact from the gains on asset sales in the quarter and if you have specificity outside of Scarborough, which I think, you mentioned that will be appreciated to? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. So, if you look at, I\u2019ll give you a couple comparisons to give you perspective. So if you look at the quarter-on-quarter\u2026 Doug Terreson : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : \u2026 impact from earnings, it was about $180 million and most of that was in the upstream, okay. Doug Terreson : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : Sequentially\u2026 Doug Terreson : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : \u2026 it was a negative impact of about $130 million, sequentially being versus the fourth quarter of 2017 and most of that negative impact was in our downstream business. Doug Terreson : Okay. Thanks a lot, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. The key aspects just a little bit more Doug\u2026 Doug Terreson : Yeah. Jeff Woodbury : \u2026 is you mentioned Scarborough. Doug Terreson : Okay. Yeah. Jeff Woodbury : And then I mentioned the some marketing and distribution assets in South America and also I mentioned\u2026 Doug Terreson : Okay. Jeff Woodbury : \u2026 the European assets primarily retail assets, okay. Doug Terreson : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Blake Fernandez with Scotia Howard Weil. Blake Fernandez : Hey, Jeff. Good morning. I know you ran through some pretty good detail on the downstream, but I wanted to ask you more specifically on the upcoming IMO changes in 2020. There's an awful lot of optimism among your independent refining peers. And I didn't know if Exxon had any view, do you share in the same kind of enthusiasm as far as what that\u2019s going to do to just look demand in some of the heavy oil discounts, so just didn\u2019t know if the company had a view? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Well, its good question and good morning, Blake. So if you think about our investments. They\u2019re all really embedded in our deep understanding in the energy markets that are -- that\u2019s really informed by our energy outlook. I mean that\u2019s why we do it, is to get down into the very deep insights that really guide our business strategy and our investment plans going forward. And this is one of those factors is our policy ultimately will impact the energy system and the products ultimately the society will need. We've been watching this closely for some time. You have seen that we've made a number of strategic investments notably in places like our European assets with Antwerp and Rotterdam. We are going to Coker and Antwerp. As I said Rotterdam were putting the hydro cracker in that\u2019s going to take us out of the lower value products like marine fuel oil into higher value distillates like ultra low sulfur diesel. As well as grow to lubricant-based stocks. The -- when you think about IMO 2020 specifically, what we want to be position to do is to offer a suite of options for the marine industry. So we are going to positioned to provide things like low sulfur blends. We\u2019re going to provide also sulfur marine gas oil. We will have LNG capability to provide. But also high sulfur fuels for ships with scrubbers. So one of the advantages in addition to these investments we\u2019re making in Europe is that we got a fairly comprehensive conflicts of refinery network in the in the U.S. Gulf Coast that will be able to provide these products as well. So, I think, in short I just say that we are providing a lot of optionality and we think we are very well-positioned to address this change in sulfur specs, as well as a number of other changes on the horizon. Blake Fernandez : Understood. Second question I can\u2019t believe buyback hasn\u2019t come up yet, but this quarter, if I am kind of rewinding last year, I think, we went through this, first quarter seems to be fairly elevated as far as the requirement to offset dilution. I think you had $425 million. I am trying to confirm that that number should theoretically roll-off here throughout the year. And then I didn\u2019t know if there were triggering pointing, I mean, debt reduced, you\u2019ve get free cash flow, is there anything else you really kind of need to see in order to get the buyback program kind of up and running over and above this dilution? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. So, let me just make sure you understand the number of that I\u2019ve talked about in the first quarter. The $425 million was anti-dilutive purchase associated with our benefit plans and programs. That usually happens in the first quarter of the year, okay. If you think about the buybacks and I certainly understand the interest around buybacks. I mean, simply put buybacks remain on the table, okay. The first priority is to be true this core mission I talked about previously and that is growing shareholder value. If we have opportunities that will provide accretive value investment opportunities, that's where the dollar will go. We are intensely focused on value growth. Now we do recognize an important distributing value to our shareholders and we do -- we generally do that as a priority through our cash dividend. And I think we\u2019ve shown our commitment to reliably grow dividend as we\u2019ve already talked about. And I think, as I said, it really demonstrate the confidence that the corporation has in it is business. But as you think about the buyback, we continue to think about it quarterly and we think about what is the current financial position of the company. I would say it\u2019s very strong. Second, we look at what our investment and our dividend requirements are, and then we think about the near-term business outlook and the fundamentals, and what we think we need in the near-term in terms of additional cash for our investment program or debt maturity, and all those go into a view on whether we want to go ahead and start buyback shares again in a sustainable way. I\u2019ll just highlight for everybody, remember that since the merger of Exxon Mobil we have bought back about 40% of the shares outstanding. So it has been a key part of our total distributions and it will continue to be one of the options that we will consider. But, first and foremost, reliably growth the dividend, and then, second, accretively invest in our business and then we\u2019ll think about how to use that extra cash. Does that help Blake. Blake Fernandez : Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Guy Baber : Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Guy. Guy Baber : I wanted to take Permian midstream and logistics, I mean, strategy here a little bit, especially such an important growth driver for you all. But we have seen differential widening out in the Permian for oil and for gas, and potentially widening out again later this year for some time for oil, as those oil pipes get filled. Can you just help us to understand how your Permian crude is priced, maybe how much exposure you have to Midland pricing, how much you move to higher price markets. And then, maybe just an update on where you stand regarding some of the midstream capital investment opportunities that you've discussed and the strategy to just maximize the value of your product there and then I have a follow-up. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. That\u2019s good, Guy. I am happy you brought this point up. Because remember what -- a very -- the fundamental strategy that we've taking within our business is this value chain perspective. Permian is an outstanding example where we built this, what we believe an advantage position in the Permian, such that we can go ahead and develop the resource leveraging our expertise and things like development planning, extended-reach drilling, completion technology, reservoir management and drive the unit cost down lower than what we believe others will be able to do. But, importantly, we\u2019ve got to carry that all way to what we think is we\u2019ve got a very advantage footprint -- manufacturing footprint in the Gulf of Mexico and thus the importance of the midstream segment, okay. And if you think about what we have done is, we have a good line of side on that value chain to make sure that nothing is leaking out of there from a value perspective without making -- us making a decision if that was -- that's good -- that\u2019s a business decision. That we shouldn\u2019t capture that that value ourselves. And we\u2019ve done things like purchase the Wink terminal which we were looking at the potential to go ahead and expand that. We entered into a joint venture with Energy Transfer Partners or a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, where we combined our pipeline assets to gives us a broader export flexibility. But it is important that, that when we think about these things from a value chain perspective, it\u2019s all about making sure that you\u2019ve got a long-term view and then you position yourself smartly such that you\u2019re capitalizing on the value proposition. So as we think about our Permian production, we are -- we\u2019ve positioned not only the logistics network but also the supply chain to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value proposition and you think about some of the disconnects or the challenges some we\u2019re having, we\u2019re clearing all of our Permian barrels. We\u2019ve got ourselves lined up that we\u2019re able to make sure that we can get them into market and have the flexibility either to capture the value uplift or manufacturing footprint or send them somewhere else via export in order to capture that value. So a very important example of how the integration has really provided significant value uplift for the corporation, okay? Guy Baber : Yeah. Very helpful. And then I had two follow-ups here, one on the CapEx front, understanding it\u2019s early in the year, the CapEx was up year-on-year as you highlighted. It was actually a little bit below our model, can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing globally from an inflationary or deflationary perspective, as you\u2019re ramping up activity here in your key areas? And I am sorry if I miss this earlier, but in Guyana, Liza-5, was there anything incrementally share at least the five at this point and maybe how are you thinking about the size of that third FPSO as you integrate those results? Jeff Woodbury : Okay. Let me start with the last question first. In Liza-5 we\u2019re still early days. We\u2019re still -- the well itself was within our expectations and now we\u2019re moving into the testing program. So, there\u2019s really nothing more to share on it. We have -- we still are holding a resource, recoverable resource about 3.2 billion barrels, but I\u2019ll remind everybody that that excludes any additional add from Ranger and Pacora at this point, because we still need to do some more delineation drilling in order to update the resource assessment. All of that is being real time integrated into our development planning for the subsequent phases had to Guyana. First phase under 20,000 barrel a day vessel. Second phase, it looks like we have enough FID, yeah, but it looks like it\u2019s going to be about a 220,000 barrel a day vessel. The third one we\u2019re looking at it based on the data real time. We haven\u2019t landed on anything at this point. But you can see what we\u2019re trying to do is, we\u2019re trying to get into more of these manufacturing routine like we\u2019ve really benefited from in the past like in Angola, is to really get to the point, where you start designing and you start rolling out these comparable similarly designed facility, such as you maximize the value proposition there, but very exciting the time for Guyana. There\u2019s lot going on as you can appreciate from exploration all the way now to planning for production. So watch that space and we\u2019ll provide updates as we progress. On your other question around, generally the market and any inflationary pressures. I mean, clearly, there\u2019re going to be certain services or specific geographic areas that there are inflationary pressures. Like there\u2019s a lot going on in the Gulf Coast, in the manufacturing areas, that have put pressure on craft labor. In Permian, obviously there\u2019s a lot of activity and that\u2019s put some pressure, but it\u2019s always about making sure that you stay ahead of all that and that you\u2019re positioning the business, such that it can offset any type of pressure, and in fact, maintain the focus on structural reductions in our business, and that really, frankly, starts all the way back to how you design these projects. But if you think about the Permian by way of example, we\u2019re continue to drive unit cost down through our drilling efficiencies, it\u2019s all about capital efficiency, so then as you develop or produce these assets to the life that you\u2019re doing it at the lowest cost. But there are areas that we continue to focus on. We are proactive in terms of our contract reward -- awards. We really look at the total cost of ownership to identify supplier cost reduction opportunities. We leverage bidding. We have a very robust supplier relationship management program. We've got the ability because of the financial possibility the corporation to accelerate and bundle equipment purchases. So, it's all about make insure that we drop the cost down which has historically been able to offset that inflationary pressure. Now, you may have some in certain places that we're also working through but by and large it's -- what is the lowest lifecycle cost of our assets. That\u2019s good Guy Guy Baber : Yeah. That's perfect. Thanks, Jeff. Jeff Woodbury : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng : Hi, guys. Good morning. Jeff Woodbury : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Jeff, just I think on behalf of the investor that the -- I will appreciate that Darren and the other management team will be coming to the call later in the year. So I think that's a quick step in the right direction. Well, anyway, two quick question. First, I think, you have drill a number of well that is 12,000 to 15,000 feet lateral in both Bakken and Delaware several months ago. So, I presume that they have been producing for at least couple of months by now. Is there any production data that you can share, what you have seen in terms of testing the limit there? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Well, Paul, let me give you update where we are on those. First, just remind everybody, we try to give a view of what we saw the value was by extending the lateral lengths in these wells in the Analyst Meeting. You can always go back and refer to that. We have drill the number of these 15,000 foot wells in the Bakken that are still early that they are producing. I would tell you that the results are meeting our expectations in terms of what we would expect in terms of the uplift. We have also drilled some in the Permian. They have not yet being completed at this stage. You remember a lot of these wells have been drilled by pads, so in order to optimize, again focused on capital efficiency they're going to coming in batches. We're being careful. I am going to be very candid with you. We\u2019re being very careful what information we disclose on this, because we do think that there is a competitive adventure here. And but I will tell you that we see the value uplift that we had portrait in the Analyst Meeting. Paul Cheng : Second quarter then, given the takeaway capacity in Western Canada, doesn't seems now you are going to resolved anytime soon. And look that, that portfolio within -- those opportunity within your portfolio also seems they have come down in terms of the packing order or ranking. So, how should we look at the incremental oil sands development project at this point from you guys? I think up and until the last year, even May last year that you guys were suppose to go ahead with a number of repetitive project, including the Aspen and the other one. So those deal is being on track to be developed or that there was just being say put back into the paper now? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Good question, Paul. What I tell you is, as you know, we've been working oil sands for over three decades both in the mining and in-situ perspective. Fundamentally any new investment is going to compete at the top of our investment portfolio. It\u2019s got to generate as we talk previously generate an attractive return that's accretive to our financial performance and has durable in a lower price environment. We continue to identify opportunities to enhanced profitability in both in-situ and in our mining operations. Imperial just talk about what we're doing in Pacora in terms of improving reliability. The same has been true in the in-situ operations, by and large not only optimizing the steam operations, but trying to leverage the fairly deep technology work that we've been doing in our research facility. And looking how we can best apply the proprietary as I said deep potential that we think we'll not only improve recovery but also reduce costs, and importantly, the environmental impact. So I tell you that portfolio and as you probably aware it is a clearly sizable amount of resource that we\u2019ve got up there, it\u2019s getting a lot of focus around applying the right technologies and capabilities in order to ensure that it competes at the portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it has fallen down on a rank. It\u2019s just like every other resource we\u2019ve got, we are working on it and if we come to a point at some stage that we think that the value preposition is meets our objectives than we\u2019ll move forward with it. Is that good Paul. Paul Cheng : Yeah. One just follow-up on that, will you anyway that go ahead to sanction the project without clear sight takeaway capacity in Canada is being resolved? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. So it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s very similar to whole Permian discussion I had, Paul, I mean, we have been thinking about making sure that, one, we have got the takeaway capacity, and two, that we\u2019ve got the flexibility to run these crudes in our equity refining capacity. So it stand ahead of that and making sure that we\u2019ve got that flexibility available and that was -- frankly that was one of the or the key justification of why we invested in the Edmonton Rail Terminal. But, obviously, we -- our big supporters are making sure that there is investment and infrastructure, and that has been more challenged in certain areas. But we will continue to look forward to make sure that we are working the value chain in order to maximize that value preposition. Paul Cheng : Got it. Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you, Paul. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Jeff Woodbury : Hello Roger. Roger Read : Sorry about that, I had to kick the mute off. Can you hear me now? Jeff Woodbury : I can. Roger Read : Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Hey\u2026 Jeff Woodbury : Good morning. Roger Read : If I could follow-up a little bit on Guy\u2019s question on the Permian. I mean, I totally get it, this is not a -- not anything but a plan program of development for you in the midstream. But are you -- if you were to need more pipeline capacity, should we presume that everything would be done within the joint venture with ETP or would you kind of evaluate the other options as you go forward. I am just kind of thinking over the next several years we are going to have these periods of pipeline over capacity, pipeline under capacity relative to production growth and how you\u2019re looking at maybe specific routes out of the Permian for all of it, both the liquids and the gas side? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. No. We would be evaluating all options. We would not restrict ourselves to one avenue. Remember, I know I keep on saying the same thing, but it\u2019s all about, how we are going to maximize the value preposition and we\u2019re looking at all the different midstream options that we can go ahead and consider. You may recall, I believe sometime last year that we went ahead and announced that we were looking at spinning another $2 billion in the U.S. for infrastructure investments, things like the expansion of the Wink terminal and enhancing our logistics flexibility and optic. So we\u2019re considering a range of options. Roger Read : Okay. I appreciate that. And then looking at your rig count the lower 48, four in the Bakken, 27 maybe go into 30 in the Permian. Clearly the Permian area is set up for growth. I was curious so as you think about the Bakken with four operated rigs, is that more of a stability or is that actually also in a growth position? Jeff Woodbury : Well, if you look at the analyst presentation, where we showed the build up from our U.S. tight oil. Roger you\u2019ll see in there that we had segmented that between the Bakken and the Permian and through 2021, 2022, if I remember right, you have got the Bakken actually growing in terms of volumes and then in essence of Plato\u2019s, but of course, we maintain an active drilling program. The biggest build up is coming from our Midland assets, I mean, our Permian assets. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thanks. Hi, Jeff. I realize we are not too far or removed from the analyst meeting, but given the comments that you made about, first of all, the importance of integration on U.S. Gulf Coast, with your Permian operations? And second, all the preparations you are making for IMO. I was wondering if you could address any further progress you have made towards FID the Beaumont light oil expansion and the Singapore resid upgrade project and maybe any critical past items to actually reaching those FIDs? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. No. I appreciate you are asking. If you recall, I think, it was in the analyst presentation on the Permian, we showed that we were looking at significantly increasing our light oil processing capability by about 400,000 barrels a day by 2021 I think it was. And a key aspect to that would be that we\u2019re thinking about as potential expansion of light crude refining capacity in North America, but that is currently still being considered, no final investment decision has been made at this point. We are -- I tell you we were given a lot of thought to a number of options. Clearly, we want to bring that to closure pretty quick and we would expect to see an FID decision probably sometime next year to get us on track to meet the objectives that we laid out in the analyst presentation. The other, I am sorry, Jason remind me, what was the second one? Jason Gammel : The Singapore resid upgrade project. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. So, that continues to move forward in Singapore. I mean, remember there is a number of projects that we have got on -- going on in Singapore right now. The resid upgrade is in progress and it should startup here shortly. Jason Gammel : Okay. Great. And then just in terms of the PNG... Jeff Woodbury : Jason, let me clarify. Jason Gammel : Yeah. Jeff Woodbury : We are looking at doing FID decision on that here soon. Jason Gammel : So that was a way I took it. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Jason Gammel : And then if I could just ask on the PNG, LNG expansion, Jeff. Are you actually actively marketing volumes from the expansion and have you reached the informal agreements with any buyers HOA type of agreements? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. So Jason we have got as you can appreciate with the number of LNG projects that we\u2019re progressing forward. We\u2019ve got a number of efforts in progress to go ahead and market those volumes, not just PNG but others elsewhere. Obviously, the specifics of those are confidential but just rest assured, remember we did the fundamental premise that we laid out at the Analyst Meeting is to really move forward these projects that were on the far left side of the cost to supply curve such that they compete very well to that demand growth that we anticipate over the period -- this period out to 2024 or 2040. So very well-positioned and we are moving a number of those discussions -- commercial discussions forward. Thank you, Jason. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Rob West with Redburn. Rob West : Hello, Jeff. I am interested in making a couple of comments on some aspects of the results and interested in your thoughts on how it looks to you and how you way to think about it. But when I look at the production across the different geographies of the upstream business, there\u2019s a lot of red in my spreadsheet of year-over-year decline and particularly in West Africa where I -- and see from one of your partners the investment levels going into some of those box in Angola that looks like it might continue to be in decline for a while? So I am quite excited by the long-term projects you are doing and the new growth that should be coming through in a few years and quite excited by that that next year when the Permian starts really inflecting. But in the near-term should we be expecting more year-over-year decline in the upstream production volumes and how should we think about that? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Let me talk about more generically that, obviously, there are a number of, let me call, leverage that we pull in order to maximize profitable volumes, I mean, a key aspect of what we\u2019re doing is in the base business where we've got -- this is the depletion decision as you are aware. And we've got a very strong focused on how do you improved reliability and enhanced open recovery and you'll see a lot of what we're be investing are very large resources that give us more flexibility to go ahead and apply our technical knowhow and our technology in order to increase recovery. So, there is a part of the organization that's focused on how do you mitigate the decline by enhancing recovery and operational reliability. Then there is another segment that you got out there that is focused on accretive investment. That's why we've been -- typically that's what we spend a lot of time talking to the investments that we make in these very large resources like Hebron, Sakhalin-1, Upper Zakum and that's all focused on making sure that we bring long-term value to the corporation that is durable with the volatility in commodity price cycles. Rob West : I am deeply in favorable of the value approach and but in terms in the next few quarters, should we be expecting decline year-over-year and that's okay because the longer loan growth is coming? Jeff Woodbury : Yes. Well, I mean, certainly, there is decline every quarter. I mean these -- all these reservoirs are depleting. And as I said, in my comments, for 2018, we expect production to be comparable to 2017, okay. As I indicated, in the second quarter, due to reduced seasonal gas demand, we do expect the second quarter to be lower. As we turn the corner to the second half of the year, there are number of things that we would expect that will drive our volume upward and that would be the things I mentioned, and the project activity, the tight oil activity move into the higher gas demand period of the year and then our ongoing conventional program. But no change to our communicated guidance, that we would be generally flat with 2017. Rob West : Okay. Thank you. That's clear. If I can have a follow-up, I was reflecting on the charges coming through the business to hit the corporate line over the quarter. And my question is about effectively the tax write back for every dollar of charge has just going down. You used to get a $0.35 on a $1 back and now it\u2019s $0.21. Just -- has that triggered any cost reduction target, cutting corporate costs, or cutting some of those expenses that a lower tax rate back on? Jeff Woodbury : Well, I mean, I'll tell you, Rob, I mean, being with this company for 35 years, there is always an intense focus on optimizing on our cost. It just not in the\u2026 Rob West : I thought you might say that. Jeff Woodbury : I am sorry. Rob West : I thought you might say that so I interrupted you, keep on going. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't require something to trigger that mentality. I mean that need to be part of your DNA. I mean that is an imperative part of a value proposition is finding ways to get more productive and to reduce the cost structure. So, rest assured that that is the focus across all aspects of our business. Thank you, Rob. Operator : We go next to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Thank you for taking the question. Just one for me, we've seen a lot of headlines about unwinding of your joint ventures with Rosneft due to the U.S. and European sanctions. Can we get an update on the amounts of CapEx that\u2019s you are investing in Russia this year and where that capital is going given the restrictions on where you are able to invest? Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Pavel, let me clarify this aspect to make sure that there is no misunderstanding. As it relates to resources that are covered by the sanctions. First and foremost I want to be clear that we're fully complied with the sanctions, okay. There were a number of joint ventures we attend joint ventures that were involved in -- that would have been covered by the sanctions and as the U.S. codified those sanctions and expanded in 2017 we chose to go ahead and withdraw, which we've initiated that process with our partners, okay. And we laid out the specifics of -- the specific impacts that in our 10-K. And as you know, specifically, that resulted in a write-down of any expenditures that were associated with those joint ventures. Now separate from that is that we do have other activities that are not impacted by the sanctions. By way of example, we\u2019ve got a very long-standing relationship, successful operation on the east coast of Russia in Sakhalin-1 and that continues as it was previously it has been very successful in terms of the investment program and the value proposition for both resource owner and the co-venture partners. There is also some other joint venture relationships that we have throughout the world with Rosneft that we\u2019re pursuing. So I want to make sure it's clear that as it relates to the sanctions we are fully compliant with them but the rest of our business is progressing as intended. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Can you share how much capital you're putting into Russia this share? Jeff Woodbury : No. We don't have that information to share. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Appreciate it. Jeff Woodbury : Thank you, Pavel. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP. Theepan Jothilingam : Yeah. Hi, Jeff. It\u2019s Theepan here. A couple of questions actually, firstly, just thinking about your disposal program and in the context of higher upstream prices. I was just wondering whether things change in terms of trying to increase that run rate, I saw the first quarter was quite reasonably a bit ahead of that typical $4 billion per annum mark that you've guided to, so any thoughts that would be great. And then, just coming back to refining, could you perhaps talk a little bit in the context of what margins you are seeing so as we come through Q2 and maybe relate that also to what Exxon is seeing the global oil demand for 2018? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Well, Theepan, thanks for your question. On the -- what I call our asset management program or divestments, I think I alluded to you in the prepared comments that we have been very focused on taking full advantage of where we think we can get incremental value on certain assets versus what we see as continued operations. So it's all about making sure that we maximize the value proposition sometimes, we don't ultimately get offers that would do that and we continue to operate those assets. We\u2019ve been very careful to make sure that we don't know force a divestment because we\u2019ve communicated an expectation around a certain number of assets or certain dollar value that we expect to get from it. But rest assured, I mean, as you saw in the first quarter we had another $1.4 billion of gross proceeds from divestments that we will continue to pursue where we could get incremental value through the divestment program and I think we've indicated a couple times that we would be very aggressive at that. But we\u2019re not going to go ahead and walk away from value if we -- if the markets not going to offer what we think is worth or more than that. On for the refinery margins, we don't project margins into the future, but I will tell you specifically as we think about demand, we expect demand to be up in the second quarter and third quarter driven by seasonal impacts. And certainly, what we've got to be doing is making sure that we maximize the product value by the offerings that we have, and of course, also maintain the logistics and feedstock flexibility in order to increase the margin that we will get from our downstream business. And, Theepan, did you have a question about oil demand. Theepan Jothilingam : Yeah. Just wanted to get in that context, how you see\u2026 Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Theepan Jothilingam : \u2026 demand year-on-year, clearly you\u2019ve got a very wide footprint globally, so just want to get a sense on that? Thank you. Jeff Woodbury : Yeah. Yeah. So broadly speaking, I mean, I think, recognize that demand has been fairly strong last couple of years. In fact if you put it in the perspective of a 10-year average it\u2019s been in excess of the 10-year average. Round numbers, last year\u2019s demand growth was probably in excess of 1.5 million barrels a day. It's been fairly robust, but as you go into this year and by the way with that demand growth and with the supply, I mean, OPEC objective of get to the kind of five-year average of OECD inventories is within reach, recognizing we still have excess supplies versus where we were at year end 2013, it had something that certainly continue to be mindful of, as well as the significant supply capacity that remains out there in the industry. Going forward, we see it fairly similar to 2017 in terms of demand and that's very consistent if you go back, all the way back to our energy outlook, we see that demand is grown about, oil demand is grown about seven-tenths a percent between now and 2014 per year. So it is the deep insights that we get from that demand assessment that we do that really allows us to guide our business strategies and our investment plans going forward. Thanks, Theepan. Operator : And at this time there are no further questions. Jeff Woodbury : Well, I certainly want to thank everybody for their questions. I do want to clarify just one point to make sure my response was appropriate that there is a question about the earnings and cash sensitivity to the price of crude and we have some of this in our 10-K that you can go ahead and reference. But broadly speaking for every barrel of crude price it relates to about $425 million of earnings and about $500 million a cash for the year. But going forward I want to thank you again for your time and your thoughtful questions. We always appreciate the engagement and the insights that you bring into the discussion, and we're looking forward to continuing that engagement as we go forward. As you would appreciate we have taken an extra effort in order to engage with investment community at all levels with the corporation and I think that is allowing us as we talked earlier to provide a much clearer articulation of that value proposition that we laid out to the investment community in the analyst meeting. So thank you for your time and your interest and we\u2019ll be in touch in the future. Operator : This does concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Roger Read - Wells Fargo Securities Paul Cheng - Barclays Bank Theepan Jothilingam - Exane BNP Paribas Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir. Neil Hansen : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Exxon Mobil's second quarter earnings call. By way of introduction, my name is Neil Hansen. I assumed the role of Vice President of Investor Relations on July 1. I look forward to interacting with each of you and discussing Exxon Mobil's performance and long-term value proposition. That will include ongoing efforts to improve transparency and increase engagement, which we'll continue with the call today. As you saw with the earnings release this morning and as we will discuss during the call, the second quarter results were well below market expectations. We'll review some of the factors that resulted in that deviation. Although challenging in some regards, it was also a quarter highlighted by significant progress on key near-term priorities, along with a number of notable milestones related to strategic investments across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical business lines. These investments underpin our plans to increase long-term earnings potential and shareholder value as we outlined at the analyst meeting in March in New York. As we've previously announced, part of our commitment to increase engagement is participation in earnings calls by members of our management committee, including participation by our Chairman, Darren Woods, for the fourth quarter and full year earnings review. Joining me on the call today is Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President of Exxon Mobil. Neil oversees Exxon Mobil's Upstream business. After I complete the review of the quarterly financial and operating performance, Neil will provide his perspectives on the significant progress we made during the quarter and investments that will create long-term shareholder value. Neil and I will be happy to take your questions following a few prepared remarks. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation. I will now move to Slide 3 and start by summarizing a number of developments that influenced second quarter performance, specifically as it compares to what we experienced during the first three months of this year. The Upstream benefited from the higher liquids prices experienced during the quarter. The increase in our average liquids realizations was generally consistent with the changing markers, including the $7.60 increase in Brent and the $5.10 increase in WTI. Upstream production in the quarter was impacted by seasonally lower gas demand in Europe and scheduled maintenance, which was undertaken to support operational integrity. A 25% growth in tight oil production in the Permian and Bakken relative to the first quarter provided an uplift to volumes as we ramped up drilling activities and secured logistics capabilities in an area that will continue to see tremendous volumes growth. We also achieved a number of significant milestones on long-term growth plans in Guyana, Brazil and Mozambique, which Neil Chapman will discuss in detail later on the call this morning. In the Downstream, seasonal increases in demand and higher levels of industry maintenance resulted in stronger industry-refining margins in North America and Europe. A widening Brent-WTI Midland spread with Permian production outpacing logistics capacity also helped to strengthen refining margins in North America. We safely and successfully carried out a significant level of scheduled maintenance during the quarter to improve operations and strengthen our refining network, partly in preparation of the upcoming changes for the International Maritime Organization standards, related to the maximum levels of sulfur and marine fuels, which will go into effect in the year 2020. Scheduled maintenance had a significant impact on second quarter refining throughput and associated expenses. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound resulted in unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. In line with our long-term strategy to grow higher-value products, sales of retail fuels and lubricants increased during the quarter. In addition, we expanded our presence in key growth markets like China, Indonesia and Mexico. We also made significant progress on strategic projects in Beaumont, Antwerp and Rotterdam to increase the production of higher-value products, including premium ultralow sulfur fuels and Group II premium lubricant base stocks. While long-term demand fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business, we experienced weaker margins in the quarter as improved realizations were more than offset by higher feed and energy costs. On the other hand, the successful completion of strategic growth projects contributed to higher sales. Slide 4 provides an overview of earnings for the second quarter. ExxonMobil's second quarter earnings were approximately $4 billion or $0.92 per share, up 18% from the prior year quarter. The growth in earnings compared to the second quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by the Upstream, moderated by a $0.50 - or 50% decline in Downstream earnings. Earnings declined by 15% from the first quarter of this year with lower contributions from all three business lines. I will start the more detailed review of our second quarter results with reconciliations of the financial and operating performance for each of the business lines relative to the first quarter of 2018, and starting first with the Upstream on Slide 5. Second quarter 2018 Upstream earnings were $3 billion, a $457 million decrease from the first quarter. Crude realizations rose nearly $8 per barrel or 13% versus the first quarter, while gas realizations were down slightly. Lower seasonal gas demand in Europe contributed significantly to a $180 million negative impact on earnings compared to the first quarter. Downtime, representing the impact on earnings from both lower volumes and increased maintenance spend, reduced earnings by $210 million, largely driven by scheduled maintenance in Canada. Other items, including higher exploration and production expenses, decreased earnings by $190 million. Finally, the absence of the first quarter gain on the Scarborough asset sale contributed to a reduction in earnings of $420 million. Moving to Slide 6 and a comparison of second quarter Upstream production to the first quarter of this year. Oil-equivalent production in the quarter was 3.6 million barrels per day. Liquids production was essentially flat versus the prior quarter, while natural gas was down 14% or 238,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Increased downtime mostly related to scheduled maintenance in Canada at Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude, negatively impacted production in the quarter. Lower seasonal demand in Europe accounted for approximately 85% of the change in volumes compared to the first quarter. Liquids growth in the quarter included a continued increase in unconventional Permian and Bakken production and the ongoing ramp-up of Hebron volumes, which more than offset natural fuel decline. Moving to Slide 7 and a comparison of second quarter Upstream earnings to the second quarter of the prior year. Second quarter 2018 Upstream earnings increased by $1.9 billion from the prior year quarter. Higher prices increased earnings by $2.4 million, driven by a $22 per barrel or 49% improvement in ExxonMobil's crude realizations, which was consistent with the change in markers. Lower volumes reduced earnings by $120 million, with unfavorable entitlement effects from the higher prices, partially offsetting growth. Downtime relative to the prior year quarter decreased earnings by $230 million, with impacts essentially evenly split between scheduled and unscheduled downtime. Impacts from the earthquake in Papua New Guinea was the largest single contributor to the losses from unscheduled downtime. Production in PNG reached full capacity in April, following the earthquake in the first quarter and is now consistently operating above original design capacity. All other items decreased earnings by $170 million, largely due to higher production expenses and increased exploration activity, primarily in Brazil. Moving now to Slide 8 and a comparison of second quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year. Oil-equivalent production in the quarter was 3.6 million barrels per day, representing a quarter-over-quarter decline of 275,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, with liquids down 3% and natural gas down 13%. Lower entitlements resulting from higher prices reduced volumes, as did continued efforts to high grade our portfolio, with the largest impact versus last year coming from the divestment of our operated assets in Norway. Increased downtime, primarily for scheduled maintenance, also reduced volumes in the quarter with the most significant impact coming in Canada at Syncrude, Cold Lake and Kearl. The decline we experienced in the quarter was in line with our general expectation that base volumes will reduce by 3% each year. However, the more pronounced impact of decline on gas production, in part, represents an intentional near-term effort to focus growth on higher-value production. Thus, we saw a decrease of approximately 12% in U.S. unconventional gas volumes, reflecting minimal investment. This shift to value is also evident in the growth we saw in liquids, which was more than offset - which more than offset decline in mature assets as production in the Permian and Bakken increased compared to the same quarter as last year and production from Hebron continue to ramp up. Moving now to Slide 9, I will review Downstream financial and operating results, starting first with a comparison of second quarter performance with the first quarter of 2018. Downstream earnings for the quarter were $724 million, a decline of $216 million compared to the first quarter. Refining margins strengthened in North America and Europe, driven by seasonal demand; higher industry maintenance; and for North America, a widening Brent-WTI differential, contributing $630 million to earnings relative to the first quarter of the year. An increase in higher-value sales contributed a positive $50 million, including an increase in retail fuel sales with additional sites in the U.S., Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg and record quarterly Mobil 1 sales in the U.S. and China. Major plan turnaround activities at SAMREF, Gravenchon, Baytown, Strathcona and Beaumont significantly impacted second quarter results, largely driving the $620 million decline in earnings relative to the first three months of the year. This includes the impact on throughput and related maintenance expenses. Depreciation in the euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted earnings by $210 million. Moving now to Slide 10 and a comparison of current quarter Downstream earnings relative to the second quarter of the prior year. Downstream earnings for the quarter were down $661 million compared to the second quarter of 2017. Stronger refining margins in North America contributed to a $260 million increase in earnings, as we were able to successfully capture the benefit of widening regional crude differentials, primarily West Canadian and Permian. Growth in higher-value sales of retail fuels, again driven by an increase in the retail network in the U.S., Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, combined with record quarterly sales of our flagship, Mobil 1 lubricants in the U.S. and China, resulted in a $100 million benefit to earnings relative to the prior year quarter. Downtime, including both volume and expense factors, resulted in a $620 million negative impact in quarter-over-quarter earnings. This included approximately $375 million from scheduled maintenance activities in Europe, North America and the Middle East to support operational integrity and to strengthen our global capabilities in advance from the change in IMO marine fuel standards. Planned turnaround activities were successfully completed at SAMREF, Gravenchon, Baytown, Strathcona and Beaumont. A majority of the losses from unplanned downtime were carried over from events that occurred in the first quarter, impacting earnings by approximately $245 million compared to the prior year quarter. These reliability incidents were obviously disappointing, however, repairs are now essentially complete and we are returning to full production. Significantly improved reliability is expected in the third quarter. The depreciation in the euro and British pound relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted earnings by $240 million. The absence of asset sale gains, mainly related to the sale of our Downstream Nigeria assets and retail assets in the U.K. and Italy in second quarter of last year, led to a relative decrease in the current year earnings of $130 million. Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results on Slide 11, and starting with a comparison of the current year quarter with the first quarter of 2018. Second quarter Chemical earnings were $890 million, a $120 million decrease from the prior quarter. Weaker margins negatively impacted earnings by $90 million as higher feed and energy costs outpaced stronger realizations. Earnings increased by $50 million compared to the first three months of the year as new assets in Singapore and U.S., combined with the absence of the Yanpet turnaround increased sales volumes. The depreciation in the euro relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted earnings by $50 million. Turning now to Slide 12 and a review of the $95 million decline in the current quarter earnings relative to the second quarter of 2017. Weaker margins resulted in a decrease of $210 million as higher feed and energy costs outpaced stronger realizations. Higher product sales improved earnings by $120 million and resulted from the startup of the Mont Belvieu polyethylene expansion and the addition of volumes from the Jurong Aromatics acquisition in Singapore, combined with stronger demand. Moving now to Slide 13, which provides an overview of key second quarter financial results. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $8.1 billion, including $300 million in proceeds from asset sales. Second quarter CapEx was $6.6 billion, reflecting continued investments to support long-term growth plans. Including the acquisition of additional interest in the BM-S-8 block in Brazil and the purchase of PT Federal Karyatama, one of Indonesia's largest manufacturers and marketers of motorcycle lubricants. Free cash flow was - free cash flow after investments was $2.7 billion. We distributed $3.5 billion in dividends to our shareholders during the quarter, reflecting a 6.5% increase from the first quarter. Debt into the quarter of $41.2 billion, a slight increase compared to the first quarter, while cash declined slightly to $3.4 billion. Moving to Slide 14 and a review of 2018 sources and uses of cash. First half earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital, combined with the proceeds of our ongoing asset sales program, yielded $18 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales. In line with our capital allocation strategy, cash flow from operations and asset sales fully funded first half investments and shareholder distributions, while also allowing for reduction in debt, further strengthening our industry-leading financial flexibility. PP&E Adds and Investments and Advancements of $5.4 billion in the second quarter were slightly above the first half trend, again primarily due to discrete outlays in the quarter related to the acquisition of the additional offshore interest in Brazil and the previously mentioned lubricants acquisition in Indonesia. Shareholder distributions of $3.5 billion in the second quarter reflect the 6.5% increase in the dividend. Finally, the negative change in working capital seen in the first half of the year was driven primarily by inventory build due to the planned maintenance activities and the use of longer haul crudes as we leverage our integrated business to take advantage of favorable economics by exporting WTI-linked crudes to our refining networks in Europe and Asia. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President of ExxonMobil, to provide some perspective on second quarter performance and the progress we have made towards the long-term growth strategy we outlined in the 2018 analyst meeting. Neil Chapman : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the call. Neil, the number one Neil, has provided the details. But I think it will be useful before I get into the progress versus our objectives that we laid out in March to put my perspective on what you just heard from Neil. This quarter was a low point in terms of volumes in the Upstream and Downstream. In the absence of some unknown or extraordinary events, volumes will steadily increase through the second half of the year. In the Upstream, there are two messages. First, lower volumes in the second quarter versus the first quarter were due to the seasonality of our gas business. So I think you all understand, it is primarily in Europe. That reduction was fully anticipated and was consistent with prior year's quarter-to-quarter variation. To our Investor Analyst Meeting in March, I said we anticipate our Upstream volumes this year will be roughly in line with 2017. Of course, that was, as I said at that time, absent of price and divestment impacts. Year-to-date, we've indeed seen an impact from price and from divestments. But on our full year basis is the major driver for reduction of our production forecast. When you combine this with the smaller impacts of unplanned downtime that we experienced in the first half, of course, with the Papua New Guinea earthquake being a significant part of that and the ongoing work to reduce our exposure to the lowest value U.S. gas business, we anticipate 2018 average volume will be around 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. And of course, again, that assumes no change in the current prices and no further divestments that impact volumes. Going back to reducing our exposure to the U.S. gas business. You saw the impact in Neil's discussion of volumes, but it did not to have a material impact in earnings. As I've commented previously, all volumes are not equal. There is a range of profitability on the volumes we produce. Our focus is on value, and we will continue to upgrade our mix and strengthen our portfolio. In other words, there's no structural change in the Upstream business from the perspective that I provided to all of you in March. Couple of comments on the Downstream business, downstream and refining business. As you have heard, we had a heavy turnaround in scheduled maintenance in the quarter. The cost and loss of sales from these scheduled outages was large and clearly had the most significant impact on the Downstream earnings. These are planned and were fully anticipated. However, as you know in the first quarter, we had significant losses due to reliability incidents in the Downstream. Unfortunately, the impact of these continued into the second quarter. We are not happy about it. We're all over it in terms of getting back to our expected reliability performance. We've thoroughly investigated. There's nothing systemic in these incidents. As of this month, these incidents that originated in the first quarter and carried through into the second quarter, they are behind us. Like the Upstream, there's no structural change in our Downstream business. We are on plan in terms of our strategy and the growth plans that we laid out in March. I will provide some details on that in the coming slide. My focus, of course, will be on the Upstream. So to begin with, a reminder of the five Upstream developments that I outlined at that time. These are key to our midterm growth plans. Our Deepwater projects in Guyana and Brazil, which as I said in March, carry significant upside potential; the transformational opportunity that we have in U.S. unconventional liquids, and of course, that's led by our very strong position in the Permian; and our low-cost LNG opportunities in both Papua New Guinea and Mozambique that we believe will play a key role in capturing the strong growing market demand. These key growth opportunities reflect the strongest portfolio ExxonMobil have had since the merger of our two companies in 1999. They are attractive across a range of prices. They will all begin to produce in the near to the midterm and contribute to our strongly growing Upstream earnings. Let me start with some comments on the - what I regard as really excellent progress we are making on the Stabroek block offshore Guyana. Estimated gross resources for the block, ending assessment of the latest discoveries, is now more than 4 billion oil-equivalent barrels. And that's up from the 3.2 billion that I communicated in March just 4 months ago. We made the eighth discovery on the block with the Longtail exploration well, which accounted over 256 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone and establishes the turbo area as a potential hub of over 500 million oil-equivalent barrels recoverable. We're currently making plans to add a second exploration vessel offshore Guyana, bringing our total number of drillships on this Stabroek block to three. The new vessel, we plan that it will operate in parallel to the Stena Carron to explore the block's numerous, high-value additional prospects. The collective discoveries on the block to date have established the potential for now up to 5 FPSOs, producing over 750,000 barrels per day by 2025, the potential for additional production from significant number of undrilled targets and plans for rapid exploration and appraisal drilling. You may remember in the March meeting, I was outlining that we had three FPSOs in our plan and we were looking at a production level of 500,000 barrels per day, so it's a significant increase. With our ongoing exploration success, we also see an increasing development pace and the potential for increased scope. The Liza-1 Phase 1 project is progressing very well. Pre-drilling at the development well started in May with the Noble Bob Douglas rig. We have batch drilling wells for maximum efficiency, and we've completed the top hole sections on six wells to date and are now working through the intermediate hole sections. Conversion work on the FPSO Lisa Destiny, and that's in Singapore, of course, is progressing well. We remain on track for first oil early in 2020. Liza Phase 2 will be larger, 220,000 barrels per day FPSO. In June, we submitted a draft environmental impact assessment and the development plan for the government's approval. We're targeting start-up of that FPSO in 2022. The Liza-5 well successfully tested the northern portion of that field and along with the giant Payara field, will support the third phase of development to Guyana. Payara development will target FID in 2019, and we'll use an FPSO designed to produce - at this stage, we see an approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day as early as 2022 - 2023, excuse me. The updated production profile reflects this increased pace of development from what I shared with you in March. We have a strong focus on partnering with the Guyanese and enabling local workforce and supplier development to support this growth and the success of Guyana's new energy industry. About 50% of ExxonMobil's employees, contractors and subcontractors are Guyanese. A number that will continue to grow as operations progress. ExxonMobil spent about $24 million, with more than 300 local suppliers in 2017. And we've opened a center for local business development in Georgetown, to promote the establishment and growth of small- and medium-sized local business. Let me turn to Brazil. Offshore Brazil, we completed the purchase of interest in BM-S-8, containing part of the greater than 2 billion barrel pre-salt Carcara field where development planning activities are rapidly progressing. This high-quality development has better than a 10% return at $40 a barrel Brent. With current drilling in BM-S 8, the Guanxuma well has encountered oil. The preliminary results are very encouraging and, of course, further analysis of this well nature is ongoing with our partners on the block, Equinor, Petrogal and Barra. In Bid Round 15, we were awarded eight deepwater blocks across Santos, Campos and Sergipe basins with exploration activity progressing. And in the fourth pre-salt bid round, we were awarded the Uirapuru exploration block. This is important for us. This block is adjacent to Carcara and we believe offers potential development and production synergies as we move forward. So that leads to our total acreage build offshore Brazil now being 25 blocks, a significant change from what we described in March. We are actively maturing drill well planning for multiple additional wells in the next two years. Looking at the U.S. We continue to grow our unconventional liquids. Our total net production of liquids unconventional in the U.S. is up 30% year-on-year. In the Permian, we brought over 50 new wells to sales in the quarter, resulting in second quarter Permian production up 45% in the first quarter this year. We now have 34 active operating rigs in the Permian, 17 in the Midland, 17 in the Delaware and six active rigs in the Bakken. On the completion side, we have 11 active completion and fracking crews in both basins in the Permian and three in the Bakken. We're actively expanding the wind terminal. This is the terminal, of course, that we acquired in late 2017 to accommodate more throughput. We've executed multiple contracts that will enhance pipeline capacity from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. We have more than secured liquids evacuation capacity to support growth through 2022. And our Gulf Coast refineries are already processing our production levels and more, capturing the benefits of disadvantaged feed cost. Additionally, we signed a letter of intent and it was announced in June with plans to develop a 1 million barrel a day long haul crude transport system that will connect the Delaware production to our world-class refining unit and chemical assets on the Gulf Coast. Finally, we've secured offtake for associated gas through 2020, and are in active negotiations for additional capacity. We have no concerns about evacuation capacity, both in gas and liquids for our Permian business. In liquefied natural gas, we continue to make great progress in Mozambique. The Coral Floating LNG project is progressing on schedule, and the fabrication of the hole is expected to start in the third quarter of this year. For the first phase of the integrated onshore development, the co-ventures have now aligned on two large LNG trains, which will each produce 7.6 million tons of LNG per year. Earlier this month, we announced that the development plan for the first phase has been submitted. ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operation of the onshore liquefaction on behalf of the joint venture. And our partner, Eni, will lead the construction and operation of the upstream facilities. We're targeting final investment decision in 2019, with the first LNG expected to be online, consistent with what I communicated in March in 2024. In Papua New Guinea, the recovery from the devastating earthquake continues. As you all know, our facilities stood the event extremely well, and operations have now returned to full capacity. This - the epicenter of this earthquake was right alongside - right adjacent to our facilities up in the Highlands. But our plant already is consistently operating more than 20% above the original design capacity, and we believe this forms a solid foundation to progress our expansions. Our expansion programs continue on plan. We're aligning on a three train 8 million-ton expansion with one new train dedicated to gas from the P'nyang of PNG LNG fields and two dedicated to gas associated with the Papua LNG project. So finally, I'd like to briefly mention another - a number of other highlights across the businesses that really underscore our progress on pursuing the growth plans that we outlined in March. In the Upstream, we've captured some additional key exploration acreage, Offshore Pakistan, where we signed an agreement to acquire 25% interest in Block G; and in Namibia, we completed the farming agreement to acquire 40% interest in the PEL82 license. Improvements are on track at our large mining operation at Kearl. We anticipate producing 200,000 barrels per day this year as I communicated at the Analyst Meeting. And of course, that's up more than 10% from 2017. In the quarter, we reached the Heads-of-Agreement with the government and our co-venture partner, Shell, on amended fiscals and production outlook and our gas venture in Groningen, Holland. Qatar petroleum farmed into our Argentina unconventional developments with an agreement to purchase 30% of the equity. Consistent with our focused shift towards U.S. liquids on the unconventional space, we divested some of our U.S. Rockies Gas assets in the quarter, representing around about 20,000 barrels per day oil-equivalent of gas production. As Neil mentioned in the lubes business, we've purchased FKT. That's a leading Indonesian distributor of lubricants, and it's included a new 700KB lube oil blend plant for blending and packaging of our products. In the fuels business, in the quarter, we reached agreements with Sonatrach for the sale of the 200KBD Augusta refinery and the three associated fuels terminals. In Chemicals, we announced yesterday that we've begun the operations of our 1.5 million-ton ethane cracker at Baytown. Of course, the associated 1.3 million tons of polyethylene facilities, which are on the other side of Houston at Mont Belvieu, are already in operation. They've been operating on purchased ethylene and are operating at full rates, in other words, at capacity. The cracker startup will enable us to back out these ethylene purchases and replace it with our own ethylene volume. In May, we announced the creation of a new joint venture with SABIC for a 1.8 million-ton ethane cracker with associated derivatives in polyethylene and glycol. The plan is this will be located in South Texas near Corpus Christi and close to the Permian Basin. Finally, we've completed the startup of our 230,000-ton Singapore Specialties in the Chemical business with production fully online. This contains the world's largest adhesive tackifier units and the world-scale halobutyl plant. So that's the comments. Neil. I'll hand it back to you, and we'll get into some Q&As. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Neil. Neil and I will now be happy to take any questions that you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Neil, best of luck in your new role. And to the other Neil, thank you for returning the call. So my first question was on the downstream. So it does let you impact quite heavily for some unplanned downtime. Hopefully, that's behind you. But could you just talk about the maintenance time for the rest of 2018, whether there's anything significant in either chemicals or refining that we should be aware of? And I've got a follow-up on U.S. gas. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Biraj. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. And I look forward to interacting with you and talking more about ExxonMobil and our value proposition. So your question on maintenance. One thing that we can say is that we do expect maintenance during 2018 and 2019 to be a bit heavier than normal. Within that, you would expect to see some seasonality, so a bit heavier in the second quarter, coming down a little bit in the third quarter. It's difficult for us to get into specific - mention specific activity at sites. But we can say that given the IMO 2020 change, other maintenance activity that we plan to do over this year and next year will result in a bit heavier activity and then you'll see some seasonality in that. I don't know, Neil, if you wanted to add anything. Neil Chapman : No, I'd just say I mean I think I mentioned in my comments, I said that we were at a low point in terms of volume in the second quarter. So with that, you'd anticipate the volumes increasing, but it will be a moderate increase and we have a - still a heavy turnaround schedule in the third quarter and not quite as large as the second quarter. Biraj Borkhataria : Great. That's very helpful. So second, just follow-up on U.S. gas and some of your comments there. But my question was really on timing. You talked about reducing your exposure to lower-value business. But the gas market has been supplied for - well supplied for a number of years now. So I was wondering what drove the decision this year to spend less? Is it just the fact that you're bringing other things into the portfolio or what's going on there? Neil Chapman : This is Neil Chapman, of course. This is an extraction depletion business as we all know. And so as wells start to deplete, you have choices whether you want to drill more in gas or you want to drill more in liquids. And we believe we have this very strong advantaged position in the Permian, of course. This goes back to the Bass acquisition that we made a couple of years ago. I've mentioned many times since then that we've just seen continuous upside on that liquids opportunity in the Permian Basin. So we have choices to make, and we have priority calls. And what we are doing is we're prioritizing liquids production over gas production. Now when we are progressing our developments in the Permian Basin, it's really important to us that we do this in the most capital-efficient way, which typically will mean drilling a lot of wells on a drill pad and we drill several at a time and then we come in and we frac them up and then we start to evacuate the gas. And that results in, it doesn't result in a steady increase in volumes. It's a little bit lumpy. Some quarters, we get a big increase in volumes. Of course, we had a 45% increase in the second quarter versus the first quarter in the Permian. But sometimes, it's less so, and you're going to see that. And what we're seeing in the first half of the year as we start to focus on liquids and I would say deemphasize somewhat, and I must say somewhat, it's not completely gas business. You've seen - we've seen a lower amount of gas production in the second quarter, first half of the year, and that will be replaced and replaced by some more with liquids in the coming period. Operator : Next we'll go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Douglas Terreson : My topic is performance improvement in the upstream. Meaning while it seems like whether because of a higher quality set of opportunities or improvement in process, that the outlook for return in Exxon's 5 key areas of investment is pretty positive. I think Neil made that case. Simultaneously, normalized returns on capital in E&P business declined significantly during the past decade or so. And it seems like there may be opportunities to create value through divestments, too. So my question is with your competitors divesting tens of billions of dollars of assets and either moving on to more productive areas or returning funds to shareholders through repurchases or whatever, also to their benefit, is there a philosophical reason why ExxonMobil hasn't been more assertive in this area? Or would you say stay tuned? So the question's about how you think about value-creation opportunities from underperforming parts of the portfolio? Neil Chapman : Yes, Doug, this is Neil Chapman. Thanks for the questions, and you probably answered some of it in your question actually. You were referencing back to a comment that I made in March, I have no doubt, where I sort of indicated, and I didn't say it exactly this way, but it was sort of along the lines of watch the space. And what I really mean about that is we have some really strong value-accretive opportunities. And I commented at the time and I stand by this that they are the most advantaged perspective, the best set of opportunities we've had since the merger and the five, I just talked about the progress and I outlined them at the Investor Analyst call. Now - if you have a portfolio in the upstream, it's really important you don't just add. You look through - for the area, look for the businesses and the assets, which don't deliver the same amount of value. And I indicated at the time, we are looking very hard at that, and that is indeed the case. There is certainly no philosophical intent to hang onto assets that are underperforming. It's far from it, Doug. I can tell you that we are very actively looking at our portfolio. We are actively managing both ends of the portfolio. And I would add to that to tell you that, yes, I really believe strongly we have five great, great assets that we're progressing these big development opportunities. But I'm telling you, if something else better comes along, we're going to progress that as well. At the same time, we're actively managing the other side of our portfolio. And it's a focus that we had in this company now for the last - at least for a long time but even more focused, I would say, in the last 18 months and certainly in the last six months. So I'm not wanting to lead that we have anything coming immediately, but we are looking and we are very, very active. So I think I'll stop there. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Douglas Leggate : Let me also welcome one Neil and - both Neils actually, and second Neil for getting on the call this quarter. Guys, I wonder if I could just start with a comment, and I've got two questions. My comment is the market, looking at the numbers, clearly didn't know or didn't expect the downtime. You guys obviously did. It would be extremely helpful if you could find some way of signaling to us that these kind of planned events are in your plan for the year to avoid the kind of volatility that we have quarter-to-quarter in your share price. So maybe something to think about. My two questions is, first of all, a follow-up to Doug Terreson's question on disposals. But Neil Chapman, I'd like to get very specific, if I may. There has been a lot of chatter from Qatar Petroleum about sanctioning the Golden Pass project and moving Upstream in vertical integration into onshore gas. So my question to the extent you're able to answer it is, is the Golden Pass sanction in your plans as it stood at the Analyst Day? And could you envisage yourself partnering upstream on your onshore gas production with Qatar Petroleum? Neil Chapman : Yes, thanks, Doug. This is Neil Chapman, of course. And I'll make a comment on the downtime and the scheduled maintenance on refining. So I think it's a very valid point that you make. And of course, we're taking that into account. And Darren Woods talked about our drive towards increased transparency. And that's really our intent. And so we take your comment. And we will, of course, be looking at it. Okay, in terms of Golden Pass, we never - Doug, we're never going to say exactly when we're going to FID a project. It's a very clear that we're actively involved with our partner QP on that project. The place we're at right now is we've got some initial bids in. We are working those bids and working the opportunity. We will work that opportunity with our partner including the Upstream part of that business. There is an obvious opportunity in that space. I would tell you that we see the demand for liquefied natural gas continuing to grow. We see that the major buyers around the world increasingly look for diversity of supply. And so that's a good opportunity for the U.S. gas business. That's one of the drivers in our Golden Pass project. The other driver is, of course, we have a lot of assets already in place now, so we can leverage that. We think it can be - bring us an advantaged opportunity together. I know you want a specific answer of when we will FID. I can't give you one. All I'd tell you is we're actively working the project with our partner. And as soon as we're ready to FID out, we'll let the market know. Douglas Leggate : I was actually pressing a bit more on your potential to sell gas assets to QB, but I'll move on. My second question, if I may, is really more of a production growth question as it relates to the guidance you gave us back in March. You'll know it's 34 rigs in the Permian. And that appears to be ahead of your schedule. And Guyana is substantially larger, it seems, than what you provided to us in your guidance in March. I just wonder if you could talk to the - what was happening in terms of the momentum and potentially the scale. And if I can risk an add-on, maybe an update as to how much of Ranger you've actually included in your resource estimate at this point. And I'll leave it there. Neil Chapman : Yes, thanks, Doug, and thanks for the questions. Look, I'll say what I've said before and I said in my comments I said in March, we're not focused on volume, we're focused on value. And what's really important to me is not the volume outlook for this business, it's the value. Not all volumes as is clearly obvious are created equally. Having said that, what I was trying to indicate in my remarks a few minutes ago, both in the Permian and in offshore Guyana is we have seen considerable upside in a short space of time. I mean, it's only three months, four months since I was up there describing both those opportunities to you. Yes, we are further ahead in terms of drill rigs than we had said at that time. And yes, we have had more discoveries in Guyana than we said at that time. We're going to develop them at the pace that we think is the best in terms of capital efficiency and the best in terms of value. I would tell you that we're not giving any different update in terms of our outlook right now in terms of a total versus what we said in March. But I do want to indicate, and it's clearly obvious from my comments earlier on, that we've seen considerable upside versus what I talked about in March. Going back to Guyana and Ranger, we have some more appraisal wells to go in Ranger. We know we have - we know, of course, from our discovery that we have a considerable resource. We're not at a position where we can quantify that right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. Jonathon Rigby : I just want to return back to the issue of performance improvement and actually related to the Downstream. I'm thinking back to the March investor update. It seems to me that the focus was pretty much on adding new capacity, new complexity to move the earnings dial. But would you recognize a comment that would say that over the last sort of 18 to 24 months is the underlying earnings performance of the Downstream, looks like it's been deteriorating, vis-\u00e0-vis competition? And I just wondered whether you felt that the performance of the business as it stands right now can deliver the kind of earnings performance you're expecting over the next 7 or 8 years just by adding the capital that you talked about, and whether this actually quite significant performance improvement also needs to be delivered by that business. Neil Chapman : Yes, Jon, this is Neil Chapman again. And maybe I'll take that question. I understand why you're asking the question on underlying performance. And I commented earlier on that we're not happy with the reliability performance that we have seen certainly in the fourth quarter, first quarter - fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year and rolled over, of course, into the second quarter. However, I don't recognize at all your comment that this may be signaling some underlying deterioration of performance. It's far from it. We are absolutely all over these reliability incidents. We pride ourselves in this company as being the leader in terms of safety, in terms of reliability, in terms of cost performance in all segments of our business and I would say probably as much as anywhere in the reliability and in the performance of our Downstream business. So no, we do not believe at all. We think it is as robust and there is no change in that at all. The projects that we discussed in March, let me just - I'm going to correct you a little bit in what you said. I don't regard these as capacity projects. They will bring a little bit of additional capacity. But they are driven about getting more value out of a barrel of oil. That's what we are trying to do. And it's all about upgrading bottom of the barrel, low-margin products like fuel oil into higher-value products. And we highlighted three projects, I believe, when we were with you in March at Beaumont, at Antwerp and at Rotterdam. The Antwerp and Rotterdam expansions, we anticipate, will be up and online in the second half of this year. And that's consistent with what we talked about before. The only capacity that we're adding is capacity that will enable us to refine more light oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast out of the Permian. That is a terrific advantage that we have. We have a refining footprint on the Gulf Coast with some small modifications, particularly at Beaumont, will enable us to purchase - to process more of this high-quality light oil from the Permian, which gives much higher value as we process that versus processing other crude oils. I absolutely understand your concern in your question around reliability. I can assure you from Darren Woods through myself through all of that leadership of this team, we're all over the reliability issue. Nobody in this organization is going to be happy if we're not meeting plan in terms of reliability. We strongly believe that the big incidents that we really had in the first quarter that rolled into the second quarter, they are all behind us. But I can tell you, there's nobody, nobody is not focused on this. And I'm absolutely confident, we are absolutely confident, it doesn't reflect any underlying deterioration in the capability or performance of our refining assets. Operator : Next, we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Neil Hansen, welcome. Neil Chapman, thank you for making the time. We appreciate you doing this. Look, I want to start off on the Canadian side of the business. And getting the Kearl up to operational capacity has taken a little bit longer than expected. You outlined a credible plan at the March Analyst Day to doing that. So where do we stand on that effort? And then on Syncrude, there were some unplanned downtime here that you guys are working through. Lessons learned and where do we stand in terms of getting that to where you want to be? Neil Chapman : Yes, let me start with Syncrude, if it's okay, Neil, and I'll come back to Kearl. On Syncrude, of course, we had this significant outage in June. We're back online partially. We are not at full capacity right now. Obviously, the operator, we're in close contact with them. They're anticipating a return to full production some time in September. This was a significant outage, big power outage, caused a lot of damage. We're back now. It will have an impact - did have an impact on volumes in the second quarter, maybe order of magnitude, 10 KBD, something like that. We'll be back online in September. On Kearl, what I said at the Analyst Meeting in Kearl is consistent and it is still the same today. We are targeting 200 KBD production this year. We are on plan to produce 200 KBD this year. We - in the second quarter, we had some planned outage at Kearl. That is behind us now. Actually, the peak daily volumes coming out of that facility are way in excess of the 200 KBD. But in our mining operation, the key to being successful is ongoing reliability of these operations. We communicated sometime last year, I believe, that we are making an investment in a parallel crusher at Kearl. And why we're doing that is because that's the most vulnerable part of this production. And we feel that once we get that crusher online, that will enable us to make a significant step change in production. We're targeting to get up to 240 KBD in the coming years. That's what I outlined before. We'll get 200 KBD this year. And that's really the outlook on that facility. I mean, I hope it answers your question. Neil Mehta : No, it does. And the second question, Neil, is more of a philosophical question. You've been spending some more time on the road, which we appreciate. And Exxon has got a unique capital spend strategy. There are a lot of companies that are shifting into harvesting mode right now and restraining capital. And your firm is leaning in and making investments, which should be ROC-accretive. As you talked to the investor community, what's been the initial feedback that you've gotten? And how has that sort of shaped the way that you want to communicate with the investment community? Neil Chapman : Thanks. And that's a good question. Let me - this is Neil Chapman again. I'll start, and maybe, Neil Hansen, you can add some perspective on cash allocation. The way we look at it is this is if we have value-accretive opportunities that are robust over a wide range of prices, that's the best way to add value to the shareholder. And that is why we have our investment program. And that is why we have the capital expenditure profile that we laid out with all of you, not just at the March meeting. The reason we're doing this is because they're value-accretive businesses, robust over a range of price scenarios. We think that's in the best interest of the shareholders. And remember, I mean, everybody knows this, this is an extraction depletion business. If you don't invest in the Upstream, if you don't invest at all, you've probably got a 6% decline across the business. So it's very important you invest. But it's not just about adding capacity. It's about adding quality capacity. I don't know. You'll have to ask our competitors why they are not investing in new projects. All I can tell you is we have very, very good projects, the best that we've had since the merger. And what I wanted to do, what we wanted to do and Darren wanted us to do is to be very transparent with the investment community on what those projects are, be very transparent in terms of why we're investing in them. We believe they are very value-accretive. And at the March meeting, we even outlaid where we saw the impact that would have on our financial results going forward. I don't know, Neil, have you got anything to add? Neil Hansen : Yes, Neil, I will say that the feedback we're getting from investors, both formally and informally, is that they're pleased with the capital allocation strategy that we're undertaking, in great part because what Neil just said. So just to reaffirm our priorities for cash, first of all, is, as Neil said, we're looking to invest in projects that are accretive, projects that will create long-term shareholder value for our - over the long term. And if you look at what we showed you at the Analyst Meeting in the Upstream and Downstream, we expect those projects at $60 a barrel to generate 20% return and in the Chemical, 15% return. So as Neil said, this is a set of portfolio opportunities that is probably the best we've had since the Exxon and Mobil merger. So that's our first priority. And again, the feedback we get from investors, they generally support that. Now after we make those investments, we're going to continue to pay a reliable growing dividend. As we mentioned earlier, we increased the dividend by 6.5% in the second quarter. Following dividends, we'll continue to prioritize our balance sheet. We want to make sure that we maintain a strong balance sheet, that we have the financial flexibility we need to take advantage of opportunities. And then to the extent that we have cash remaining after those priorities are met, we'll distribute cash through buybacks. We tend to view the buyback program as a flywheel. So really nothing has changed in terms of that capital allocation strategy. And as I mentioned, as we interact with investors both formally and informally, they reaffirm that's exactly what they want us to do. Operator : Next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : Thanks for the color and the refreshed guidance on the Upstream production for the year. It sounds like there's several different variables you're talking about here, Neil. Could you break down - I mean, it looks like the guidance is basically like a 4% to 5% decline now on a year-over-year basis. Could you give a little break down between those components, how you would allocate that? And then as we look at the improvement you're expecting for the second half of the year, just to clarify, is it basically Canada and Papua New Guinea running better? Or are there other things we should be thinking about? Neil Chapman : Yes, I mean, listen, I mean, obviously getting Papua behind us has been important. We've had great success at Hebron, which is obviously one of the newest facilities we brought online. And that is continuing to outperform our planned expectations. I would say the biggest growth that we're seeing right now in terms of liquids, of course, is what's happening in the Permian. And some questions earlier on from Doug on that on the number of drilling rigs, and I did say that we are up 45% just quarter-on-quarter. And I think that's indicative of what we're seeing there. Not all volumes are alike in the unconventional liquids space. I mean, I made that point many, many times. I think people tend to draw a broad brush across the whole of our Permian and unconventional and see it as absolutely the same everywhere. I can assure you, it is not. There are more - there are plays that are more productive. There are plays of different quality of oil that are easier to extract and lower cost. We are very, very happy with what we sit on right now. So I would say the largest increase we're going to see through this year is most likely going to come from the Permian. In terms of putting color on the number that I outlined, I feel it's very important to explain our volume outlook. And again, I really want to make a point, and I will make this over and over again and you'll get bored of me saying it, but volume is not my focus. It's not our focus. Value is our focus. But I understand the interest in volume. And that's why I elected to give you this outlook for 2018 of 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels. I don't see that as a material change from what I outlined in March, I do not. Because the vast majority of the difference comes from what I said before, which is the price impacts on entitlements, which in our business has been quite significant year-to-date, and some divestment impacts. That is the majority of the difference between when I said we will be in line with 2017 versus this 3.8 million number. The other two components are - I'm just not going to get back the production that we lost to Papua New Guinea in the first half of the year. I mean, some of this unplanned maintenance, we're not going to get it all back. And so that's going to impact us for the year. It's not a big deal, but I think it's important to highlight to you what it is. And that's why I wanted to be quite specific. But I think the only part of this which again is really a very small amount in terms of volumes, and it's not a lot in terms of earnings this year at all, is this movement, this pivot that I did indicate in March and I'm reinforcing now from gas to liquids in the unconventional space in the United States. We purchased XTO, it's a dry gas business. Everybody understands that. And we've pivoted towards liquids. And we're going to continue to pivot towards liquids because it's a more profitable business for us. And what's really, really important to us in this unconventional space is that we can leverage this unconventional experience and capability of the XTO company that we purchased with ExxonMobil's Upstream development company, who are very skilled in taking on large projects. I mean, obviously we've seen at Sakhalin, we've seen at Papua New Guinea. We saw it in Qatar. We've seen it in lots of different places, the combination of having great expertise and capability on major projects. And let me tell you, the Permian liquids is a major project. It's not a lot of small activities. It's a fully integrated major project. Combine that with our unconventional capability, then I feel like we're in an extremely strong position to develop a high-quality resource. And so that pivot from gas to liquids is really important, not just for the long term but for the mid-term of this business. I would tell you their production profile, I know everybody wants to see a continuous growth quarter-on-quarter. I'm telling it's going to be lumpy. Because the way we are going to do this is we are going to do it in the most capital-efficient manner we can. If that means drilling a whole bunch of wells and then just drilling them and fracking them six months later because that's the way of being capital-efficient, we are going to do that, I can assure you. So it's a little lumpy and it's what we've seen in the first half of the year now. It's my long-winded answer to your question, Phil. But we've seen a dropoff in gas as we've not reinvested as much in the gas business. We've put more of that investment in the liquids in the Permian. And obviously, we would anticipate seeing the results of that in the coming years. Philip Gresh : I appreciate that. My second question is just around the CapEx in the quarter. You called out some M&A spending there. Just want to get a refresh on your thoughts on capital spending for the full year. And if possible, if you could call out how much of that was the one-time acquisition spend and if any of that acquisition type of spending bleeds over into the third quarter based on some of the activities that you've been undergoing that may not have closed. Just to - I think people may have been a little bit surprised by the spending number. But obviously, there's some specific activities you had underway. Neil Hansen : Yes, this is Neil Hansen. I think year-to-date, for the first couple of quarters, we're sitting at about $11.5 billion of CapEx. And I think we indicated at the Analyst Meeting that the full year outlook for CapEx is $24 billion. So there's no changes at this time in that number. As you mentioned, sometimes this comes in lumpy, especially as we make acquisitions. And we did have those two discrete outlays in the second quarter. In addition to those two items, as Neil mentioned and consistent with the Permian story, is we are seeing an increase in capital activity out in the Permian. But the plan is really flexible. It depends on timing. So these things can happen in waves during a quarter. But again, no change in plan for the full year. Neil Chapman : Yes, I think that's right. I mean, there's no change signaled in what we said before. Philip Gresh : Could you provide the M&A spend that was in the quarter? Neil Hansen : No, I don't think we want to provide specific commercial terms for those two acquisitions. Operator : We'll next go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I guess you made the comment earlier, Neil, about creating value more so than thinking about production growth. Can you give us an idea, given the intensity of activity in the Permian today, the growth profile laid out on Slide 19, when the Permian becomes more of a value-add or a cash flow provider as opposed to a cash flow consumer? Or thinking of capital intensity right now, it clearly would be running underneath the overall Upstream business, when that might flip to the other side. Neil Chapman : Yes, it's a good question. And honestly, I don't - Roger, I don't want to get into the specifics in terms of just the Permian. Having said that, I mean, I think you can work the math yourselves. You get up to a certain volume profile and it becomes cash additional rather than taking cash away. That's really important. We said we'd have cumulative cash flow at the analyst call of over, I believe, $5 billion between '18 and 2025. That was the outlook we gave at that time. There's no change in that. But I do want to point you back to that volume curve that we showed earlier on. It's been called the green wedge in the industry. But you can see where we are on that green wedge. And I think it's just illustrative of we are on plan. And I've indicated that we are optimistic about achieving that plan and frankly some more. So I really don't want to give you a timing and say by 2021, 2022 or 2019 that we are going to be cash positive in there. I don't think that adds a lot of value, albeit I understand what you're saying. What I would tell you though is don't forget the value proposition that we described on the Permian to the investment community. Yes, this is an absolutely foundational part of our earnings growth, financial growth plan, value growth plans in the Upstream. It is also very, very important for the Downstream business. I talked earlier on about our ability to process this light crude and how we see that giving us a distinct advantage in margins over the average of industry because of the facilities. We decided, and we made it clear back in March, that we will get engaged in the connectivity between the Permian and our Gulf Coast refining and chemical assets. In other words, we're going to participate sometimes with equity plays in the logistics. We bought the Wink terminal, we've announced that we're talking about a long-range crude pipeline where we'll have equity. I think what's really important here is that everybody understands being on that end-to-end value chain gives us a significant advantage. Now we've all seen the disconnect in Midland versus Cushing, in Midland versus the Gulf Coast on crude in the last quarter. And of course, a lot of that's driven by - we believe, driven by a tightness on the evacuation capacity of the industry. But if you're processing that crude, you're buying that crude at low value as well, which we just move that value from the Upstream into the Downstream. And when we do that, of course, we're getting more NGLs which our chemical companies benefiting from it. So I think different from most of the competitors in the Permian Basin, that value proposition on the integrated value chain is going to become increasingly important, not just in the Upstream. But we anticipate you're going to see that in the Downstream results. And obviously, the fact that we are making significant Chemical investments, which is all about processing the NGLs, primarily ethane, of course, is another indicator of what we're achieving. So yes, I mean, I know you want an answer on exactly on the cash flow. But I'm going to stay neutral on that. I'm going to tell you no change from what we told you before. Roger Read : I appreciate that. We've got to try, right? Nice segue for Chemicals. In the quarter, obviously you cited higher feedstock cost, energy cost as a negative for the margins. I was just curious, does that - is that something that looks transitory? Or we should think of that as tied to kind of oil and naphtha prices as that works across maybe some of the global feedstock? Or do you see it as this is what prices have done, and thus this is something that we're just - we need to consider in our forward look for the Chemicals business? Neil Chapman : I think you should see it very simply as chemical feedstock is primarily based on a barrel of crude oil. And as the crude oil price goes on, as these processes are through the Chemical business has to pass on that increased price, in other words, low margin to the industry - to the chemical industry. So if you go back in history and look at the chemical business during a period, and I'm talking about the industry now, not just ExxonMobil, if you look at a period of rising crude oil prices, chemical earnings tend to lag. In a period of a falling prices, chemical earnings tend to deliver much more. And it's all about the lag in the industry. Now what is different about our footprint is the price of chemicals, primarily petrochemicals, typically polyethylene plastic, which is the bulk of our business, of course, that is set by crude oil and naphtha price in Asia Pacific because that is what sets the majority of the polyethylene feedstock, which is naphtha-based in Asia. Our Gulf Coast refineries are processing largely ethane, which is coming out of the Gulf Coast. So when there is a big disconnect between the gas and crude price. And obviously, you've seen your Henry Hub gas price has barely moved, but the oil price has gone up significantly in the first half of this year, that is a benefit for anybody who's processing U.S. ethane into chemicals and capturing the price that's been set by crude oil. We've just started up our 1.5 million ton ethane cracker in Baytown. I love the timing of that. It's up now. And we're getting going on that. But also our existing crackers at Baytown, Baton Rouge and Beaumont are processing a heavy percent of ethane, which really captures the way I always like to describe it is this gas-to-crude spread. And when the gas-to-crude spread goes up, then chemical businesses that are processing ethanes and NGLs in North America are going to benefit from that. So one part of the answer to your question is there is a lag in the industry with rising feedstock prices. The other part is if you can capture the benefits of that crude-to-gas spread, obviously that's an advantage in the industry. And quite frankly, Roger, that's why a lot of people are investing in crackers on the Gulf Coast. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng : Welcome, Neil, the Neil, VP on IR. A couple questions, if I may. Neil, for Qatar, any update you can - I mean, that's probably the most profitable Upstream business that you have today. For the LNG, the government has been talking about expansion. We heard some of your competitors, they're talking that they may come to a conclusion by the end of this year and early next year. Is there any update that you can provide? And also along that, I think that most of your existing operation, they have a 30-year contract. And some of the early ones that come onstream, say, back in the year 2000, those will be coming up for renewal pretty soon. Is there any update you can provide? Neil Chapman : Neil Chapman, Paul. Thanks for the question, and thanks for recognizing Neil's first time on the call. Frankly, the short answer to your question is no, we don't have any update. I think the more expansive answer to your question is we've really got a terrific reputation and relationship with the Qataris. It's been a really important part of our portfolio as you just have highlighted for a long time. And we fully expect and we hope it will be a considerable part of our portfolio in the future. We're well aware of what the Qataris have said publicly. We're well aware of what our competitors have said in terms of expansion opportunities in that North Field. I don't like to talk about our ongoing discussions until we have something public. I don't think it's fair on the resource holder. I don't think it's fair on the competition. But I fully understand why you would like to know. In terms of extension of the licenses, unfortunately, my answer to your question is the same. It would be unfair to talk about our ongoing discussions with QP and the Qataris. Of course, we're talking about both with the Qataris. And I'm sure they would tell you the same thing. Our intention is to continue to maintain a very robust business that brings maximum value to the nation of Qatar, but of course, is beneficial to our shareholders. And I know, Paul, you wouldn't expect me to say nothing else. But I'm sorry, I really don't want to get into the details. Paul Cheng : Okay. So maybe let me try a different question that perhaps that I have some better luck. Permian and Bakken, you've been doing some pretty long natural well, 12,000, 15,000 feet. I believe that they must be already in production. Is there any kind of data points that you can share? Neil Chapman : Well, yes. And I know there's great interest in the length of these laterals. And you know what - and I've heard comments in the industry. And frankly, I've heard comments from the investment community on many occasions about saying, \"Well, are these long laterals really beneficial? Are they more capital-efficient? Are they more productive? Do they get more out of the resource base than a shorter well?\" Look, the reality is all unconventional space, all unconventional liquids are different, meaning that in some occasions, yes, it absolutely makes sense based on our experience to drill longer laterals. It's a capital-efficient way. It's the best way of extracting the resource. And yes, we do have some in terms of where we can assess the production rates. And we're very comfortable with what they've done. In fact, they've been very positive results. But I do want to caution you, it doesn't mean to say that we're going to drill 3-mile laterals everywhere. We're going to drill the lateral length based on the maximum recovery and the best capital efficiency of that resource base. It is really important, I believe, for people to understand that not all of this resource is the same. So I believe our technology is advantaged. I believe that we can drill these long laterals because we have the technology advantage to be able to do that, some can't. What's really important in the Permian is does your acreage allow you to drill these long laterals? If you do not have contiguous acreage, in other words, if you have acreage that's a mile square or a 2 mile square, you cannot drill a 3-mile lateral. You don't have the capability to do it. The acquisition of the Bass acreage, Poker Lake and in the Big Eddy have been really important because it gives us that opportunity to drill those longer laterals. And really, Paul, I would really encourage you to think of it that way. It would be, in my opinion, a significant mistake to try and generalize that resource base. And I would tell you, not just between the Bakken and the Permian or the Delaware and Midland but even within those basins and even within the multiple horizontal plays. Because as you're well aware, there is multiple plays, and we will extract that resource depending on the quality of that resource in different ways. And I know I sound like a little bit of a squeaky record on this, Paul. But that really is what we believe strongly. Paul Cheng : No, absolutely. I mean, we fully understand it's very different, maybe even from session-to-session sometimes. But I guess, the question then that in the - in your - at least in your acreage position in the Permian, do you foresee that, that 3-mile lateral will be a regular or the average that you're going to push for that, let's say, the [indiscernible] or that is only a small session of your asset in the Permian that you think that is advantageous? Neil Chapman : Yes, I mean, I would position the way I see it as a tool in our toolkit. That's the way I look at it. It's a tool... Paul Cheng : And technically, that you have proved you can do that? Neil Chapman : We've just not proved that we can do it. What's really important here is if you look at the amount of resource that's extracted out of the unconventional space - and again, it's very different from play-to-play. But it's a relatively small percentage of the resource is actually recovered. I mean, you'll see the industry talk about it. And I won't tell you what our numbers are. But 8% to 10% of the resource is recovered in an unconventional play. If we can extract more than 8% to 10%, you can understand the potential value for us in that. And so it's not just about the length of the lateral, it's about how much resource you can recover from that rock. That will arguably drive the economics as much as how much resource and how quickly you get the resource. There are statistics, everyone sees them, they are public data in terms of how quickly and what the production rates are from these wells. And I know some players in the industry \"with great gusto\" that they're getting a lot of early production and a lot of volume out of the wells initially good. Yes, good, I want to get the maximum volume out of these wells over the life of the wells. And so I am less interested in the early production rates. I know people in the industry are - do seem to be interested in that. I am not. I'm interested in the maximum recoverable resource in the maximum or in the most capital-efficient way. Paul Cheng : Sure, that's the way to manage it. Neil, can I just sneak in a really quick one. In Guyana that you're talking about 4 billion barrels, is that 4 billion barrel of oil or 4 billion barrel of oil and gas? And if it is the latter, what's the percent of oil? Neil Chapman : It's a 4 billion barrel of recoverable resource of oil equivalent. I mean, again I'm not going to give you a number in terms of oil and gas here. Well, to make sure I'm sure, you're talking about Guyana here? Paul Cheng : That's correct. Neil Chapman : Sorry, I missed the first part. Yes. And so it's primarily oil. Currently, what we're doing with the gas is it will be the - at least the plan currently is for the most part to reinject it to help recovery. We are in discussions with the state around putting some of that gas onshore for power generation, early stages on that. But what we're talking about is recoverable resource. I won't give you a number, Paul. But I will tell you it is primarily oil. It has relatively a low gas content. Operator : Our last question will come from Theepan Jothilingam with Exane BNP. Theepan Jothilingam : I've just got two. Firstly, as you think about delivering these mega projects, could you talk about how you mitigate for the risk of cost inflation, particularly an up-cycle for the commodity? Are you thinking about procurement in a different way for this cycle? And the second question was just outside Guyana, could you perhaps outline the areas of interest in the second half in terms of Exxon's exploration program? Neil Chapman : Yes. And Neil Chapman here. I would say in terms of exploration program - and of course, we're a global player. I mean, I would highlight Cyprus. We've been quite clear on Cyprus that we anticipate drilling two wells in Cyprus in the fourth quarter of this year. And that is on plan. Of course, we've made a significant investment in Brazil. We won't be - it will be more in terms of acquiring seismic on those blocks in this year if you're looking for this year. And we'll be drilling some exploration wells on these prospective blocks coming in 2019. What was the other part of the question? I forgot. Theepan Jothilingam : Yes, I was just wondering about cost inflation, what you're seeing. I mean, you've clearly got some great projects and you're improving things, I think, on the capital efficiency side. But is there a risk you might actually face cost inflation in a higher oil price environment? Neil Chapman : Well, there's always a risk. I mean, I think there's always a risk. But obviously, our objective is to be the most efficient, you'd understand that. Let me just talk about the Permian for a second because the Permian is really important. And I've heard a lot of discussion around cost inflation there. And of course, the potential exists for high intense activity in a local area to end up with cost inflation. It's one of the areas which I really believe we have an advantage. Because we have such a large position in the Permian, it is allowing us to establish long-term contracts. And I think what's important on these long-term contracts, it's not just about drilling rigs, it's not just about fracking crews. It's about what you do with sand, how you can get sand in. It's about what you do with power and how you get power in. It's about what you do with the recovered water. It's about logistics and evacuation. So we look at all of that. We believe that having the scale that we have is allowing us to mitigate more than anybody else cost inflation in the basin. I've heard discussion around cost inflation in the Permian Basin in recent months. We have not seen a lot of it. And the reason we haven't seen a lot of it is because we're leveraging our long-term position with the partnerships that we have established. I think going forward, obviously it's absolutely on our minds in terms of how would we mitigate that potential inflation if it really goes on. And that could be in terms of how we purchase power or do we produce power? It can be in do we mine our own sand? It can be in lots of different areas. I would also tell you that if I go back to Guyana, and of course, that's a high intense activity for us right now, we're being very careful in the design of these ships. The resource space is quite similar across all these exploration blocks. And what that allows us to do is, using an old ExxonMobil term, of design one and build many. And so what I think you have to do in this environment is you have to look for ways to structurally offset the potential of inflation. Do not wait until it hits you. And that's been our message to our organization. We want to see where we have a structural advantage. It's built into the appropriation. And each of the assets that we are building, we ask our project organization and the business all the time, demonstrate to us how you're going to offset the potential of inflationary pressure. Thanks for the question. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Theepan. To conclude, thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in ExxonMobil. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is Jack Williams. Jack is a Senior Vice President with responsibility for the Downstream and Chemical business lines. As we'll discuss on the call today, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. It was a quarter highlighted by strong operating performance, significant growth in liquids production, and considerable value from our integrated business model. As a result, we delivered the highest level of cash flow from operating activities since 2014. In addition, we completed several advantaged projects and made significant progress on investments that will generate long-term accretive value for our shareholders. After I review the quarterly financial and operating performance, Jack will provide his perspectives on third quarter results and give an update on several key investments and strategic focus areas. Jack and I will be happy to take your questions following our prepared remarks. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation. I'll move now to slide 3, which summarizes a number of developments that influenced our third quarter performance. As I mentioned previously, cash flow from operating activities was the highest it's been in four years, dating back to the third quarter of 2014. Corporate charges for the quarter were outside the $700 million to $900 million range that we typically experience. This was due to net favorable absolute one-time items of $420 million, primarily related to tax. Now it's important to note that we expect fourth quarter corporate charges to be at the high end of the normal range of $700 million to $900 million. Crude oil prices increased slightly during the quarter, with Brent up $0.92 and WTI up $1.71. Permian tight oil production increased by 17% relative to the second quarter. We continue to ramp up drilling activities in the Permian, while also maximizing the value from our integrated midstream and manufacturing operations. We had lower levels of downtime in the third quarter and stronger operating performance in Canada, where Kearl delivered quarterly record net production of 230,000 barrels per day. We also achieved a number of significant milestones on long-term Upstream growth plans in Guyana and Brazil. Jack will discuss this a bit later in the call. In the Downstream, tighter supply resulted in stronger fuels margins in Europe, while wider crude differentials contributed to improved margins in North America. We successfully leveraged our midstream logistics capacity to capture significant value by moving advantaged crudes from the Permian and Western Canada to our manufacturing facilities. Improved utilization from lower scheduled maintenance and better reliability also contributed to stronger earnings in the quarter. In line with our strategy to grow sales of higher-value products, we successfully started up a new hydrofiner at our Beaumont, Texas, facility and a delayed coker at our Antwerp refinery. The hydrofiner will increase production of ultra-low sulfur fuels by 45,000 barrels per day, using a proprietary catalyst that will remove sulfur, while minimizing octane loss. The Antwerp delayed coker will increase supply of distillates and marine gas oil, further strengthening our Downstream portfolio ahead of IMO 2020. The long-term demand fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business. We experienced weaker margins during the quarter. Improved realizations were more than offset by higher feedstock costs, primarily U.S. ethane. A significant scheduled turnaround at our Singapore facility also impacted quarterly results. We continue to expand Chemical manufacturing on the U.S. Gulf Coast. This included start-up of the 1.5 million metric ton per year ethane cracker at our Baytown, Texas, chemical and refining complex. Now moving to slide 4, which provides an overview of third quarter financial results. Third quarter earnings were $6.2 billion or $1.46 per share, up 57% from the prior-year quarter. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $12.6 billion, including a $1.5 billion in proceeds from asset sales. Third quarter CapEx was $6.6 billion. We continue to progress investment to support our long-term growth plans, including increased activity in the Permian and the acquisition of additional acreage in Brazil. CapEx through the first three quarters of the year was $18.1 billion. Now if you exclude the acquisition of incremental Brazil acreage of about $1 billion, we remain on pace to meet full-year guidance of approximately $24 billion. Free cash flow after investments was $7.2 billion, more than enough to cover the $3.5 billion in dividends. Debt ended the quarter at $40 billion, a $1.2 billion decrease compared to the second quarter. And as a result, we've reached the lowest level of debt that we've had since the end of 2015. Cash increased to $5.7 billion at the end of the quarter. This increase, which was above our normal operating levels, due primarily to the timing of proceeds from the Germany retail divestment, which closed in the fourth quarter. So again, we received those proceeds the day before the quarter ended, and the transaction closed on October 1. We don't have the earnings impact in this quarter, but we did receive the cash. I'll start the more detailed review of our third quarter results with a reconciliation of Upstream financial and operating performance. Slide 5 provides a look at Upstream results relative to the second quarter. Liquids growth contributed to Upstream earnings of $4.2 billion, a $1.2 billion increase. Gas prices increased by 7%. Crude realizations were essentially flat, impacted by wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials. However \u2013 and we look at this \u2013 the estimated unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on our Upstream was $170 million, but given our integrated logistics and manufacturing position, that value and more was captured in the Downstream. Having the takeaway capacity that we have that exceeds our Upstream production allows us to \u2013 allowed us to realize a corresponding estimated benefit of approximately $280 million in the Downstream. Lower scheduled downtime and the absence of impacts from the PNG earthquake increased Upstream earnings by $130 million. An increase in production, in addition to the volume recovery we saw from lower downtime, contributed $320 million to third quarter earnings. Other items included net absolute favorable one-time tax impacts of $370 million. Now moving on to slide 6 and a comparison of third quarter Upstream production to the second quarter of this year. Oil-equivalent production in the quarter was 3.8 million barrels per day, an increase of 139,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day. Exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments, volumes were up 5% as a result of improved operations and a continued focus on growing volumes with the highest value. Liquids increased 3%, driven by continued growth in the Permian and improved performance at Kearl. Natural gas production was up 5%, lower downtime across the LNG portfolio including Qatar, PNG, and Gorgon. Moving to slide 7 and a comparison of third quarter Upstream earnings with the third quarter of 2017. Higher prices increased earnings by $2.6 billion, driven by a $19 per barrel or 41% improvement in crude realizations and a 30% increase in natural gas prices. Again, we estimate the unfavorable impact of wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials on our Upstream results, in relative to last year, to be approximately $360 million. The total estimated benefit though that we captured in the Downstream from our fully-integrated value chain was $590 million compared to the third quarter of last year. Downtime decreased earnings by $80 million. This was largely driven by carry over from the second quarter Syncrude outage. And just to give you an update, as of mid-September all cokers at Syncrude were back online. Other volume impacts increased earnings by $130 million. Liquids growth, largely driven by U.S. unconventional and Hebron, was partly offset by the impact from lower entitlement volumes. Slide 8 provides us a comparison of third quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year. Oil-equivalent production declined by approximately 90,000 barrels per day. However, and this is important, if you exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments, volumes increased by more than 60,000, with liquids production up 6%, including 57% growth in the Permian. Gas decline year over year was mostly in U.S. unconventional, again, aligned with our focus on value and our near-term prioritization of liquids growth opportunities. Lower entitlements, resulting from higher prices, reduced volumes, as did continued efforts to high-grade our portfolio. And the largest impacts came from the divestments of our operated assets in Norway and a number of U.S. Rockies gas assets. Increased downtime in the quarter was driven by carryover again of the second quarter unplanned outage at Syncrude. Liquids growth more than offset decline from mature fields. This was led by the significant increase in unconventional Permian and Bakken production and the continued ramp-up at Hebron. Improved performance at Kearl also contributed to the increase in volumes. Moving now to slide 9. I'll review Downstream third quarter financial and operating results, starting first with a comparison to the second quarter. Downstream earnings of $1.6 billion increased by $918 million, proved operations and the capture of significant value from our integrated business model. Refining margin strengthened in North America supported by wider crude differentials and in Europe with tighter supply. Stronger margins contributed $150 million to earnings. As previously mentioned, our integrated logistics network that allowed us to connect barrels in the Permian and Western Canada to our manufacturing facilities enabled us to capture significant benefit from wider differentials. And we estimate the favorable impact to the Downstream to be approximately $280 million versus the previous quarter. Lower levels of scheduled maintenance and improved reliability increased earnings by $460 million. The absence of last quarter's unfavorable foreign exchange impacts resulted in a positive $140 million contribution to earnings. But let me tell you, the absolute impact from foreign exchange on third quarter earnings was immaterial. In fact, it was about a $15 million help. And then finally, other items included improved refining yield and mix and minor asset sales gains. All right. Now moving to slide 10 and the comparison of current quarter Downstream earnings relative to the third quarter of the prior year. Downstream earnings for the quarter were up $110 million. Margins had a negative impact on earnings of slightly more than $100 million. And this was mostly driven by lower lubricants and fuels margins in Europe and Asia Pacific. The absence of supply tightness that resulted from Hurricane Harvey last year also impacted our relative margins. Now before I move on, let me give you some additional perspective on lubricants margins. With higher feedstock costs and softer market fundamentals for base stocks, the negative impact on third quarter earnings from lubricants margins was more than $200 million compared to last year. And then if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we've experienced approximately $500 million in downward pressure from lubricants margins. This was partly offset again by our ability to successfully capture approximately $590 million of benefit across our value chain from wider Permian and Western Canadian differentials. Downtime and maintenance resulted in a $10 million negative impact in quarter-over-quarter earnings. Higher maintenance activities were offset by the absence of the volume and expense impacts that resulted from Hurricane Harvey last year. Other items reflect the impacts of the lower U.S. tax rate, benefits from minor asset sales gains, and improved refining yield and mix. Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results on slide 11, starting first with the comparison of the third quarter with the second quarter. Third quarter Chemical earnings were $713 million, a $177 million decrease. This was mainly driven by higher planned maintenance, partly offset by growth in sales of higher-value products. Margins decreased by $20 million, as increased ethane prices impacted polyethylene margins. This was mostly offset though by stronger aromatics margins. Sales volumes increased earnings by $40 million with higher polyethylene demand and contribution from our new assets in Singapore and the U.S. Downtime and maintenance negatively impacted earnings by $140 million, mainly driven by planned turnaround activities in Singapore. The other items you see there included some unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Now turning now to slide 12 and a review of current quarter Chemical earnings relative to the third quarter of last year. Lower margins resulted in a decrease of $140 million; higher feed and energy costs outpacing stronger realizations. Higher product sales improved earnings by $30 million, supported by an increase in sales from new assets. Downtime and maintenance had a negative impact of $90 million, and again this was driven by the Singapore turnaround. It was partly offset by the absence of last year's impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Other items included operating expenses for the new assets and upcoming projects, as we continue to position our Chemical portfolio for long-term accretive growth. And unfavorable ForEx also had an impact on earnings. Slide 13 provides a review of sources and uses of cash. Third quarter earnings, adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital, yielded $11.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities. Asset sales contributed $1.5 billion in the quarter, including proceeds with the previously mentioned Germany retail divestment, which again closed in the fourth quarter. In line with our capital allocation strategy, cash flow from operations and asset sales fully funded year-to-date investments and shareholder distributions. We've also been able to reduce debt levels, further strengthening our industry-leading financial flexibility. Cash used to fund investments and shareholder distributions in the third quarter were $5.4 billion and $3.5 billion respectively. Our ending cash balance of $5.7 billion was up $2.3 billion from the prior quarter. And again this was driven primarily by the timing of asset sales proceeds. At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Jack. He will provide some additional perspectives on third quarter performance and discuss the progress we've made on the long-term growth strategy we outlined at the 2018 Analyst Meeting. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, thank you, Neil. I'm glad to be here today. And I'd like to thank all the folks on the line today for their interest in ExxonMobil. Let me make a couple of comments about the quarter. And then I'll go into some more updates on the strategic progress. We're very pleased with the business progress that's reflected in the third quarter results. First, if you look at the Upstream, if you ex entitlements and divestments, the net positive volumes growth versus both sequential and year-ago quarters really bodes well, as it reflects the contribution from just one of the five key growth areas that we talked about back in March, and that's of course the Permian. I'd also add that the Hebron ramp-up contributed significantly as well, and it's also going very well. In the Downstream, as Neil mentioned and quantified earlier, we're seeing the benefits of this integration across the value chain. And we're capturing value from low-cost crude feedstock that we purchased in Midland and Edmonton for our Gulf Coast and Midwest refineries. And that's enabled by the strong logistics position that we have. And of course, in both the Upstream and the Downstream, we're very pleased with the improved reliability. This level of performance is much more in line with our ongoing expectations and has continued into October as well. Now the Downstream did benefit from seasonally lower refinery turnaround activity. And in the fourth quarter you should see scheduled maintenance activity more in line with second quarter levels. In the Chemicals business, we are seeing some near-term impacts of recent industry supply growth, including our own, which does not change our view of the long-term attractiveness of this business. The fundamentals continue to remain strong. Our growth plans remain on track. And that's evidenced by the recent start-up of the new Baytown steam cracker. So all in all, a good quarter. So now let me cover a few slides to highlight some of the progress we're making in our Downstream and Chemical businesses. I'll start with a reconnect in the Downstream. And what we talked about was the key driver for Downstream earnings growth is this yield shift to grow higher-value products. And that's largely through the deployment of our proprietary catalyst and process technology. Now this yield shift is accomplished primarily through six advantaged refining projects. Three of these are in the near term, the Beaumont hydrofiner and Antwerp coker, both of which are now online, and then the Rotterdam advanced hydrocracker, which should start up around year-end. And just for completeness, the other three are the Fawley hydrofiner, Beaumont light crude expansion, and the Singapore is the upgrade project. So just a couple of comments on that. When I say advantaged, what I mean there is that either due to proprietary technology application or to integration benefits or both, these projects generate from mid-teens to mid-20s discounted cash flow returns. And when I say primarily, in terms of primarily those six projects, those projects really are needle movers in that regard. But there's also a few hundred other smaller optimization projects that are collectively having a big impact as well. As a matter of fact, as you think about the 2018 and 2019 turnarounds, in over 80% of those, the scope includes work on these small optimization projects. And I think it's just really a great example of how our Downstream teams are continually working to improve the performance of our assets. And the other main strategic area for us is this integration across the value chains. And in the Permian, we really have a unique position that's already generating additional value today. We're progressing a very attractive pipe-still expansion at Beaumont. And we're further building our logistics position to capture the advantaged feeds on the Gulf Coast integrated facilities. I'll talk more about that logistics in a second. On Beaumont, just a quick reminder on that project. We're adding a 250,000 barrel a day atmospheric pipe-still and some hydrotreating conversion capacity. But we're utilizing an existing gas plant and utility capacity. And we're replacing over 100,000 barrels a day of intermediate products that are purchased at Baytown and Baton Rouge. So this project is highly attractive. You're essentially getting a large-scale capacity addition for the unit cost of a debottleneck project. So very, very attractive project. And it significantly improves the Beaumont complex earnings profile. Okay moving on to Chemicals. In March we spoke of 13 new Chemicals manufacturing facilities, and these are all underpinned by these competitive advantages that we were talking about, integration, proprietary technology, performance products, and global market access. Seven of the 13 are now operational, with the steam cracker at Baytown that started up in early \u2013 early in the third quarter. We're actively progressing projects to increase our Chemical product manufacturing capacity by 40%. So if I look forward, we have the Beaumont polyethylene expansion that should start up middle of next year. We're progressing a new ethane cracker in Corpus Christi. And we've recently announced a plan to pursue a new liquids cracker in China. I'll expand on these in a later slide, but I just want to leave you with the point that we're on track with our Chemicals growth plan. So now for a couple of business updates. Start with the Antwerp delayed coker. This 50,000 barrel a day coker is now operational. And the point I want to make here is that it is located at Antwerp, but I want to stress that it's a regional coker. In other words, we're planning to process resids from our entire European circuit at this coker. And you can see on the map that we're showing here that it's centrally located in the manufacturing center of northwest Europe, so we can process third-party resids as well. At the time of FID on this project back in 2014, it was not clear when the IMO bumper fuel spec change was going to come into effect. But the project was attractive based on just trendline industry margins. And we knew the spec change provided potential upside. Of course, looking at the start-up timing today, it looks very likely we're going to achieve that upside, that additional upside. Once we achieve stable operations on the coker, we'll be looking for debottleneck opportunities to further increase capacity in the unit. And typically we're able to get about another 10% or 15% of more throughput over time. So this coker positions us well in Europe for the 2020 IMO spec change. But we're in good shape in the rest of the world as well, with the most global coking capacity of any of the IOCs. And we're also going to offer a marine gas oil and a low sulfur fuel oil option for our customers. And of course, we'll continue to offer a high-sulfur fuel oil product to the ship owners who invested in onshore scrubbers. Moving on to the Permian. We are positioned well in the Permian across the full value chain. It starts with the Upstream position, where we continue to see positive indicators on both the quality and the size of the resource in the northern Delaware Basin acreage. You can see on the chart on the left that we're making good progress versus the growth potential communicated back in March. Our XTO Permian team is very excited with the results they're seeing out there in this new acreage. And the vector is clearly up on the Permian developments. I was out there about a month ago. And in fact, the entire management committee and the board went out there. We even let Neil go out there with us. And the team, it was clear to see that the team was very energized. They're really starting to hit their stride. It was really good to see that operation. Still early days, but again, the vector is up there. Today \u2013 looking more Downstream, today we have the ability to run 450,000 barrels a day of light crude in our Gulf Coast refining circuit. And this has provided ample incentive to secure efficient transportation capacity to our refineries well in excess of equity production from the Permian. Currently, we have about 270,000 barrels a day of committed capacity. And that's likely going to grow further in the coming quarters. And the 450,000 barrels a day is growing too. In addition to the Beaumont expansion, we're working on some other smaller debottleneck projects to add about another 50,000 barrels to ultimately take our Gulf Coast light crude processing capacity to over 750,000 barrels a day. And then in addition to our three Gulf Coast integrated facilities, we run Permian crude at 10 other sites outside the U.S., including our Singapore crude cracker. On the lower left of the chart is a chart from Mark (28:05) showing the integrated earnings based on 2017 prices and margins. Year to date with the actual environment we're seeing, we've made well over $1.2 billion across this value chain. And it's clear from the current environment, it's highlighting the value of our approach in the Permian. So last thing I'd like to say is given the growth plans we have in both the Upstream and the Downstream here, we're progressing a large 1 million barrel a day plus crude pipeline system with our JV partners that's going to provide long-term efficient transportation to our Gulf Coast refineries and also other outlets. FID is planned for next year, will start-up in 2021. And we plan to be both an owner and an anchor shipper on the line. Moving on to Western Canada. And our position across the full Western Canada crude value chain is somewhat similar to the Permian, with strong Upstream and Downstream positions that facilitate a development of a really valuable midstream logistics position that ensure we capture the full value of West Canada crude, even when there's a large WTI/WCS differential. And just to clarify here, when I say we and our on this slide, I'm also including IOL [Imperial Oil Limited]. All the assets in Western Canada are fully or partially owned by IOL, and they're of course operating everything up there. Our Upstream position is comprised primarily of interest in Cold Lake, Syncrude, and Kearl. And this production is processed at the Strathcona and Sarnia refineries in Canada; our Midwest Joliet and Billings refineries; and then all of our three large U.S. Gulf Coast integrated facilities. And all of these with heavy oil processing capabilities. During the early days of bringing Kearl on stream, we made the decision to invest in a 210,000 barrel a day capacity rail terminal in Edmonton. And that's to allow efficient unit rail transportation to the Midwest and U.S. Gulf Coast in case Canadian production growth out-ramped pipeline capacity. As you can imagine, the utilization of this terminal is increasing rapidly in this current pipeline constrained environment, which provides another transportation option down to the Midwest and Gulf Coast refineries, in addition to our committed pipeline capacity. Today, we're running about 100,000 barrels a day through this terminal. That should grow to about 170,000 barrels a day by the first quarter of next year. Our Downstream logistics positions in this value chain are unique, and like the Permian, added a significant earnings contribution in this quarter. Moving to Chemicals. The chart on the left here was shown back in March. And it shows the market position of over 75% of our Chemical product sales, where we're either number one or number two in the market. Our seven new facilities that are now online have added about five MTA of additional manufacturing capacity. And as shown in the red stars on the chart, they're focused on many of the products where we already have a leading market position. We continue to progress a new 1.8 MTA ethane steam cracker along with ethylene glycol and two polyethylene derivative units at a site near Corpus Christi, Texas. Construction of that project is pending completion of the environmental permitting process. And expected start-up is in 2022. In September, we announced an agreement to pursue a liquid steam cracker complex in China's Guangdong province to produce performance polyolefin products for the domestic Chinese market. The current plan is the unit will have a direct crude cracking capability similar to our Singapore operation. And we're growing all these new facilities with a significant proportion of performance products, which currently are about 30% of our overall Chemical sales. They're growing at a rate of about double that of the commodity Chemical sales we're having. And they achieve, due to superior performance characteristics, on average about a 30% higher price than commodity products. So now let me wrap up with sharing a few other highlights in our business that \u2013 milestones since the end of the second quarter. In Brazil's fifth pre-salt bid round, we were the successful bidder on the Tit\u00e3 offshore block, adding up more than 71,000 net acres and bringing our offshore acreage build to about \u2013 well not to about \u2013 to precisely 26 blocks, two-thirds of which we're the operator. In Guyana, we made our ninth offshore discovery and fourth year to date, the Hammerhead-1 well. This discovery reinforces the potential of the Guyana Basin. So as I think Neil highlighted last month, we've added a second exploration rig. In fact, I can verify that rig has now spudded the Pluma exploration well. And we're also fast-tracking the Liza Phase 1 development, so the vector is certainly looking up in Guyana. Our Permian tight liquids production growth continued. It's up 57% quarter on quarter 2018 versus 2017. And we're currently running 38 rigs in the Delaware and Midland basins. In Angola, the first Kaombo FPSO successfully started up in late July, with production expected to reach 115,000 barrels a day. And a second FPSO is planned to start up in mid-2019. Moving to the Downstream. Our Indonesia lubricants acquisition is proceeding well. Transition with Federal (sic) [PT Federal Karyatama] (34:33) is on track. The expertise in motorcycle lubricants is complementing the mobile lubricants offer. And we think we're positioned well now to be a strong competitor in a growing market. Mexico, our fuels market entry is progressing well. Recently, we've been streaming new sites at the rate of three new retail stations per week. And in Germany, our retail divestment was completed October 1. So we're moving to our branded wholesale model there. And the Augusta Refinery and Terminals divestment is on track for completion at year end. So if the Augusta sale does close in the fourth quarter, we expect a combined earnings benefit in the Downstream from both the Germany and the Augusta divestments of about $700 million to $1 billion with forex movements being one factor that could impact the final earnings. And moving to Chemical. Start-up has commenced at our Newport, Wales, Santoprene specialty elastomer expansion project, with the first production line now in service and the second line planned for start-up in next year. And our Beaumont polyethylene plant expansion that I mentioned earlier will take the remainder of the ethylene from the new Baytown cracker that's not going to Mont Belvieu. And that's progressing well, and the start-up is planned for mid-2019. So before I hand it back to Neil for some \u2013 to start the Q&A, let me just wrap up by telling you that we're on track with our growth plans. We've seen a bit of upside in Guyana and in the Permian. And we've hit a couple of important milestones with the Antwerp coker and the Baytown steam cracker start-ups. So I feel good about where our businesses are positioned today and the underlying path we're on. We are all excited about the opportunities in front of us. And I can assure you the organization is working very hard on it. So with that, I'll hand it back to Neil. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Great. Thank you for the comments, Jack, and I do appreciate you letting me go on that Permian trip. It was wonderful. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No problem. No problem. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: All right. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions that you have. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Williams and Mr. Hansen. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. We request that you limit your questions to one initial with one follow up, so that we may take as many questions as possible. And we'll pause for just a moment to provide everyone the chance to signal. We will first go to the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys, and congrats on a good quarter here. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: And good morning, Neil. Thank you. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Morning. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, Jack and Neil, maybe you could start off by just talking about the LNG cadence of projects. You've got so many different options out there, whether that is Mozambique, Golden Pass, the potential upside of PNG, Qatar. And I think we as an investor community are wondering what are the priorities in terms of most likely to sanction? When? And how should we think about the cadence of that growth? So if you'd just frame out how you're thinking about it and where you stand with some of the key projects, that would be helpful. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank, Neil. Let me start off, Neil, and you can chime in if you like. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: We are very happy with the portfolio of opportunities we have in the LNG market. At Papua New Guinea, we're building on success there with the foundation project that's continuing to achieve performance above expectations. Mozambique, a big new area for us, large resource base. We think we're bringing some real unique expertise that we have from both PNG and in Qatar to bring to bear on that resource. And then of course here in the U.S., continuing to look at Golden Pass with QP. And obviously, very interested in any expansions in the North Field as well. So I would say that given the low cost of supply of all these opportunities, they're all attractive. We see a growing LNG demand that would certainly allow all those projects to go forward. Naturally, the Mozambique is a little bit behind PNG in terms of the onshore trains, the offshore coil may make it a little quicker. But \u2013 and obviously in Qatar, with the new trains, we would like to pursue that as soon as possible. But that may be a little bit longer term as well. So in terms of the cadence, what I'd tell you is that there's other parties involved in all of those. We find them all attractive. We're wanting to pursue them all in our typical capital efficient deliberate way. But very proud of where we are and the opportunities we have in front of us. And we're excited about pursuing all of them, Neil. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's great. The follow up I had is we've seen some increase in unconventional M&A. One of your peers doing a deal in the lower 48. And then some of the independents as well here over the course of the last week. Just wanted your latest thoughts on pursuing growth in the lower 48, whether to do it organically? Or to do it through transactions? And just what the bid/ask looks like in the market, especially with some of the shale players having a pullback here decently over the last couple months? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, yeah, thanks, Neil. You mentioned it earlier in your question. Let me just reinforce that, from an organic standpoint, we have a very exciting growth plan. We talked about that earlier. A lot of running room. We had that big acquisition, northern Delaware Basin, that we're now estimating over 5 billion barrels, 9 billion total in the basin. So a lot to go after there. Having said that, we do maintain the financial strength to be able to capitalize on any environment we find ourselves in that might present an attractive opportunity. And we continue to scan the market for all opportunities that play to our strengths. We think certainly unconventional does that. So we're continuing to look. I would say that as we think about those kinds of opportunities, we're certainly thinking about where we can really bring our development strengths. So something that would have a large undeveloped aspect to it. But we do like our organic growth plan. We feel like that's going to give us a lot \u2013 many years of substantial growth. And as you may have noticed, our rig counts is increased in the Permian and the vector is up there. And so we got a lot to \u2013 a lot on our plate right now, but we continue to look. Neil Mehta - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks, Jack. Thanks, Neil. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you, Neil. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for calling on me. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good morning, Sam. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC : I guess my first question, I'm going to relay a question that I've been encountering in the investment community. And maybe you can have a better answer than I've been able to come up with. But one of the fears that gets brought up occasionally is that fiscal terms internationally are sort of tightening. Renewals are challenging, especially with momentum in commodity prices. And people are afraid there's a lot of contracts that are scattered around the world that are sort of at risk. And that renewals aren't going to be as attractive. Can you talk about how your unconventional business \u2013 if that's true, first of all? If it's not, you can just refute it. But if your unconventional business kind of functions as an offset to that, you can simply rotate capital into the U.S. where you're seeing those international headwinds? And whether there's sort of a limit to that strategy? And just generally, if there's a strategic function to the U.S. unconventional business, besides just kind of short cycle volume growth at a high margin? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Okay. Sam, let me start with that and Neil may want to chime in. But on the last part of the question first, around the unconventional. I mean we do see it more than just kind of short cycle place to go invest. We do view that whole unconventional strategically, and it really plays to our strength with the large unconventional organization that we have. So I would certainly characterize the U.S. unconventional as strategic and as a strength of our corporation. Now getting back to the earlier part of your question around PSC extensions and terms and so forth. What I would say is that by the time PSC extensions come up, we typically had 20, 25, 30 years of operations. And we would hope \u2013 certainly our expectation, we would hope that the resource owner recognizes the strengths that we bring at that point in time. And that we are able to progress and extend, to the extent the resources are required, extend those terms, obviously with a fulsome negotiation. So I wouldn't want to pre talk about where those things are going to go and when. But I would think \u2013 we typically start out with a position, start out from a position of strength in terms of what we've delivered in terms of the value to the resource. And that certainly comes into play in terms of those types of decisions. The other thing I'd like to point out is in terms of this overall comment you made around fiscal starting to tighten and so forth, is when we talked about these five growth areas that we talked about back in March, think about when those were acquired and brought into our portfolio and the environment at the time. So we basically brought all those in kind of at the bottom of the cycle, where we had some \u2013 where the environment was reasonable in terms of getting reasonable terms and so forth. And all of those were tested hard at bottom-of-cycle conditions. So to the extent that you think things are tightening now, it makes those resources and those projects all the more attractive. Neil, anything to add? Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, the only other thing, and maybe just to reiterate some of those points, Jack, we have a long history of execution. We have a good relationship with the resource owners. We tend to be a partner of choice. The diverse portfolio that Jack mentioned does give us that flexibility, Permian certainly being an example of that. The only other thing I'd say is we've successfully renegotiated multiple extensions across our portfolio in the past. So I don't think there's any near-term pending concerns on fiscals. I think we continue to focus on making sure we deliver what we say we're going to deliver, that we establish those good relationships. And that certainly mitigates any of the risk you might have from deteriorating fiscals. Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC : Well, thanks for all that color. And my follow up is quicker, just on this theme of integration. There's obviously a lot of focus on crude takeaway from the Permian and maybe from Western Canada too. But frac has been very tight in the Gulf Coast. And you sort of highlighted it with your Chemicals summary of the period. But just how you think about the full suite of integration, besides just takeaway and refining. But maybe some of those intermediate stages too, if you have investment plans for that. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, I can make a comment there. On the broader question of the takeaway capacities and these disconnects, the nice thing about being across the value chain is it doesn't really matter whether those disconnects are there or not in terms of the value we accrue to the corporation. We'll \u2013 for instance in the Permian, we'll either accrue that value with higher crude price at the wellhead, or we'll accrue that value through our midstream and Downstream. But we'll get that full value of those molecules going all the way through the value chain to the customer. And really I think the same thing is true in Western Canada. Now on the ethane issue and the NGL fractionation capacity. What I'd tell you on that is that that's a transitory issue. And there's more NGL fractionation capacity being built, constructed right now. We certainly see that going away. We see plenty of ethane supply out there. And quite frankly, a lot of it's getting rejected into the methane stream right now. So that's going to get resolved. And I think it's going to get resolved in a matter of over the span of 2019. But I'd say that's more a transitory sort of issue. Neil? Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, I'll just reiterate. Long term fundamentals for the Chemical business remain very strong. We look at demand over time still growing at 1% above GDP. You'll see times where you'll see cyclical pressures. We don't try to attempt to time the \u2013 when we bring these investments online, we make these investments based on those long term fundamentals. Sam Margolin - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks so much. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. First area I wanted to just hit was on the Chemicals business, Jack. If we, I know there were some headwinds there from maintenance in the third quarter. But we have seen some pressure for much of the year on the earnings profile in the business. And it's a big area of investment for you guys. So maybe you could just elaborate a bit more on your thoughts here? And just in terms of the margin outlook for the various businesses? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Sure. Neil just mentioned, we do see a longer term growing demand, the fundamentals of the business still look good. The issues have kind of shifted a bit. In the early part of the year, we had depressed aromatics margins. And those look much better now. And now with the U.S. ethane feedstock increases, it hurts the ethylene and polyethylene margins. So there's a few kind of near term things going on. But it doesn't change the fundamental analysis for those supporting those big investments. We still see a growing market. We think our investments are all advantaged in terms of cost of supply. We have these performance products that are unique to us that also enhance our projects as we bring them online. So as we look at the fundamentals, we really still like that business a lot and like the investments that we have made and are making. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Second question, just a quick numeric one would be, you had mentioned the two asset sales in Downstream and the earnings impact that you expect to see. What is the lost earnings impact from both of those assets on a go-forward basis? Because that's \u2013 you guys have a lot of asset sales. And I think that's the harder part for us to figure out sometimes. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Boy, I'm not sure what the lost value is going forward. Obviously, when we look at divesting assets, we do that when someone else sees more value for the asset than we do. And so again the assumption is when we sell these divestments, we're getting more value out of them than we would if we were to keep them. But I don't have a specific number on those two individual assets on what we're giving up. But I can assure you that what we're getting today is worth more than what we would get if we were to keep them. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, I would agree on that. Yeah. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. If I could just ask one last one then. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Sure. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : On the cash flows, you had a headwind from deferred taxes. And I think in the first quarter, you had a big headwind from affiliates that you had expected to reverse at some point. Maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on where we would stand on that. Thanks. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, you're right. In the quarter, we did see an adjustment for the non-cash impacts from those favorable one-time tax items that I mentioned. If you look full year, we will always see some timing on equity companies in terms of earnings and when the dividends come in. It's tough to predict when that will happen. I think we mentioned in the first quarter that that was the case. And we have seen dividends come in from equity companies. I think another important thing to consider is these equity companies also may prioritize accretive investments over dividends. And so I think one of the things you're seeing and probably the biggest impact on a year-to-date basis is TCO. So TCO is the equity company that holds our Tengiz investment. And so obviously, they're prioritizing dividends over investing in that project. So tough to predict exactly when the dividends come in. There will always be some timing impacts. But again, we've seen some cash come in. But we're certainly supportive of those companies continuing with investments that will provide value to the shareholders. Philip M. Gresh - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Well, hi. Good morning, everybody. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Hey, Doug. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jack and Neil, I wonder if I could pick up, Jack, on one of your comments about fast-tracking Liza 1. I think originally \u2013 actually just a broader question on Guyana generally. Hammerhead, my understanding from your partners, could potentially also be fast-tracked in addition to Liza 1. So I'm wondering if you can address where you see the guidance that you laid out for Guyana at your strategy update, versus to what appears to have been fairly rapid progress in the last six months. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, on Hammerhead, the rig just moved off there. We did some \u2013 in addition to drilling the well, we did some dynamic flow testing and so forth. So a little bit too early to provide any EUR estimates on that one. So I think that leaves us at this estimate that's out there right now of over 4 billion oil-equivalent barrels, up to 5 FPSOs, peaking at 750,000 barrels a day, with Liza 1 targeting early 2020 and Liza 2 coming in behind that. We're talking to the government right now about our development plan and environmental permit. Hope to start that one up in 2022 or behind that. So we're continuing to tick on along. But when you look at the time between discovery and this projection of the Liza 1 start-up, it's very impressive in terms of what the industry timelines typically look like. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry, Jack. Just to be clear. You did say fast-track, so has the March 2020 date changed for Liza 1? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No, and I don't think we ever said March. We just said early 2020. (54:52) Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Doug, when you go from five years from discovery to online, I view that as fast track. I mean that is very fast movement. That's about as good as it gets in industry. So that was why I took on fast track. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : My follow up, guys, if I may is also \u2013 I'm afraid, Jack, it's also an Upstream question. Just going to the Permian, the 38 rigs, Q1 \u2013 or Q2 sorry, you gave us the completion cadence. You said you brought 50 wells online in Q2. Can you tell me what the \u2013 how that completion cadence looked in Q3? And what the \u2013 whether you've caught up now with your rig activity? Because obviously, it was still pretty light on the important completion pace. And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, and no need to apologize. I don't mind talking Upstream, and I don't mind talking Permian at all. I, in fact, enjoy talking Permian. Yeah, on the \u2013 let me answer your question directly, and then I'll expand it a bit. We brought on 58 wells in the Midland Basin, and only eight in the Delaware Basin in the third quarter. And you'll notice the rigs are about equal between the two basins. And what you're seeing is that in the Midland Basin, there's a lot more infrastructure. We had the rigs there longer. And so the timing just worked out to where we have a lot more wells coming online there than the Delaware Basin. Over time, some of that's going to switch over \u2013 some of that growth is going to switch over to the Delaware Basin, but it's just less mature. I think it points out the issue that I think that Neil Chapman said a couple times and I've said it as well. It's going to be fairly lumpy coming on. I mean we are basically doing three things. Our teams out in the Permian are doing three things simultaneously. First, we're delineating this big new acreage position we have, and like I said, that everybody says, that looks very promising. There is further upward vector on that resource. We already increased it from 3 billion to 5 billion barrels. And there's further upward tailwinds on that. We're building out infrastructure in the Delaware Basin. We're spending a lot of time and energy on this infrastructure build-out. There's about 200,000 barrels a day of well pad facilities under construction right now, in addition to two major central processing facilities. So \u2013 but we had essentially a blank canvas on this 225,000 acres. There was not a lot of facilities out there. So we're building all that from scratch. Which in some respect is an advantage for us, because it allows us to bring other parts of our corporation, this major project expertise, to bear on this. And we're going to wind up with an infrastructure there that's really unlike anything else in the Delaware Basin or in the Midland Basin for that matter or any other unconventional development that I've ever seen. It's going to be very capital efficient and allow us long term to have a very competitively advantaged operation. So \u2013 but in addition to those two things, we're also growing production. So they're also having some of the rigs dedicated to just developing where we know we have mature benches. And we feel like we know it pretty well, and we're just growing production. But there's all those things going on at once. So it's going to be pretty lumpy. We draw a nice smooth line, but it's going to be pretty lumpy as we go up there but \u2013 as evidenced by this quarter. And... Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jack, may I ask for a point of clarification real quick. I know I've got to jump off here. But Neil did promise a little bit more of a look-forward on some of your commentary. If you're 50 [wells] in Q2, 58 in Q3, can you give some idea as to what that's going to look like in Q4 in your current plan? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: No, I can't. I really don't know. I mean I can just tell you the rig activity we have out there \u2013 now I will say one thing. A lot of those rigs have been picked up in the last three, four, five months. And when you think about these multi-well pads that you drill four, five, six wells at a time and then have to come back and frac all those wells, all the facilities considerations and so forth, it's seven, eight, nine months between picking up a rig and having production online. So it's coming. The activity is there. We're liking what we see. But I can't give you a number for fourth quarter. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Operator : And next we'll go to Thomas Kline with the Royal Bank of Canada. Thomas Klein - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. With a good quarter and strong cash generation, I'm just wondering what else you guys would need to see, quantity, price or in terms of the environment, to prompt share buybacks? And especially in light of recent rhetoric on this from peers. Thank you. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Great. Thank you, Thomas. Yeah, we did have really what was an excellent quarter from a cash generation perspective. We're very pleased with it. I think nothing's changed for us in terms of our capital allocation strategy. And we're in a very fortunate position to have a really impressive portfolio of attractive accretive projects. And we're going to prioritize investing in those. I think we talked about how the fact that in the Upstream, they're going to generate a 20% return and a 15% to 20% return in Downstream and Chemical. So that's certainly a priority. We want to continue to pay a reliable, growing dividend. I think we've paid a growing dividend for 36 years now. And we recognize that those two things are tied together. We need to continue to invest in accretive projects, so we can continue to pay a reliable, growing dividend. Now beyond that \u2013 and you've seen a little bit of it this year \u2013 we want to ensure that we have the financial capability, the financial strength that we need to take advantage of investment opportunities, regardless of the price cycle. To the extent we can meet that, those objectives, and there's excess cash, we will certainly distribute cash back to shareholders. It's an important part of our capital allocation strategy. I think we've distributed more than $220 billion since the Exxon and Mobil merger, so it's certainly a key factor in that. And I think if you look at it maybe bigger picture, what we're trying to do is we're trying to position the company for long term sustainable distribution to our shareholders. I mean that's the objective. And we think the best way to do that is to ensure that we are taking advantage of, again, a portfolio of opportunities that's probably as attractive if not more attractive than anything we've seen since the Exxon and Mobil merger. So we're not going to prioritize buybacks over doing that, because what we're really focused on is long term sustainable distributions. Anything to add to that? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I would just say that the shareholder accretion from this investment program we have is \u2013 we think is going to be very impressive. So I'd just echo that point. That we have a very exciting investment portfolio in front of us. Thomas Klein - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Understood. Thanks you. Thank you. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Hey, thank you. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Thank you very much, gentlemen. I appreciate the conversation around the coker at Antwerp. I was hoping you might be able to make similar comments about the Rotterdam hydrocracker. First of all, just the size of the unit. And whether you would actually be also processing your European system and potential third-party VGO through that unit? And finally, whether you have the hydrotreating capacity there to be able to handle third-party high sulfur VGO? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Let's see. I think it's primarily handling the feeds from our refinery there in Rotterdam. But let me just kind of give you a sense. Again, this is advanced technology, advanced hydrocracker from the proprietary technology. And we think we're going to generate not only about 20 kbd of high-quality Group II lubes but also some clean products as well. And due to what we already had on the ground in Rotterdam, and this shift to a kind of a real lubes-based stocks generating machine, this is going to have substantial impact on the Rotterdam refinery profitability. Now we talked about, and Neil talked about, some weakness in near term in the base stocks market. And clearly, that's coming because we're adding a bunch of Group II capacity, which long term is going to be very advantaged. So don't know what we're going to be looking at when we first come on in early 2019. But it's fundamentally a very advantaged investment, one of the best returns we have. It doubles the earnings from Rotterdam. And I think again, I think it's primarily focused on \u2013 I think most of the feeds into this unit are at the refinery today. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Okay. Thank you for that. And I was just hoping that you might be able to give us where you're at in the process for that second group of three expansion projects in the Downstream. Have they all reached FID? Are they in construction? Just where are they at in the process? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, we're looking to FID Beaumont probably first quarter of next year. The Fawley unit is going to be about the same timing as Beaumont, probably more like midyear, working for an FID on that one. Singapore is a little bit behind that. We're looking more like a 2023 or so start-up on Singapore. It's a bigger project. It's a very, very large project in Singapore. Very fundamental \u2013 fundamentally shift the whole Singapore, when you take 75 kbd of resids and turn that into a lot of lubes and clean products, that's a very, very large project. That one is a little bit later. But Beaumont, we've been looking at all opportunities to accelerate that and try to get that on as soon as possible, because we see that one as extremely attractive. Jason Gammel - Jefferies International Ltd.: Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Morning, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jack, just on the Beaumont cool unit, 200,000 barrels per day. Can you share a little bit more detail in terms of how the \u2013 you're talking about that replacing maybe 100,000 barrels per day of the feed. So how's the output is going to look like at the end? How that is going to change? And what kind of CapEx we may be talking about? And when that is supposed to come on stream? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, we're looking at 2022, maybe perhaps 2021. Still looking at that pretty hard in terms of when it's going to come on stream. What we're looking at doing is a new atmospheric pipe still. 250,000 barrels a day coming in. We'll take the middle of that tower, hydro treat it there on-site, and get some diesel fuels coming out of Beaumont. So Beaumont will net increase diesel coming out of the refinery. And then the bottom and the top of the tower are going to be intermediate products to Baytown and to Baton Rouge, again replacing products that they're buying today. So not a lot of net increase in new product coming out of those, just lower cost. And again, given the advantage, 30% less than industry cost, because of all of these advantages, the utilizing existing infrastructure I talked about, and well in excess of a 20% return project. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Jack, should we assume that the diesel or distillate increase in Beaumont is somewhere in the 30,000 to 50,000 barrel per day, based on what you described? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Probably higher. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Higher than that? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, yeah, probably more like 60,000. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: 60,000? Okay. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I mean, ballpark. I don't have the number in front of me, but something like that. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And where \u2013 sure. Would that be all in ULSD, or that would it be a combination? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: It'll all be ultra-low sulfur diesel that'll be coming out, clearly, and yeah. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. And that in terms of the other, say, debottleneck opportunity, 150,000 barrel per day expansion, what kind of timeline we may be talking about? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Which project is that? Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Paul, I assume you're talking about the debottlenecks at the other facilities. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's correct. Sorry. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: So Baytown, Baton Rouge. Yeah. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, it was not 150,000, Paul, it was just 50,000. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Oh, it is 50,000. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: So we have 450,000 capacity today; Beaumont would be another 250,000; another 50,000 on top of that; and then over 750,000 total. And I'm rounding the numbers here, but over 750,000 barrels a day after Beaumont and these other attractive debottleneck projects. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. A final short one. Neil, I think earlier that you say that you will be on track to the $24 billion CapEx if we exclude the $1 billion you spent in Brazil recently. So is that means that we're going to be roughly, say, $25 billion for the year? Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, Paul, our \u2013 and as again, subject to what happens in the fourth quarter. But our current outlook is \u2013 for the full year is $25 billion. What we've seen though throughout the year, fortunately, is some incremental opportunities to acquire additional acreage in Brazil. And that's roughly about $1 billion above what we thought we were going to get. And so that's where you get to the $25 billion. Again, that's heavily dependent on what happens in the fourth quarter. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: You're welcome, Paul. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thanks for taking my questions. In the Analyst Day, Jack, you put out earnings expectation shots on both the Downstream and Chemicals. And I know they were the long term, but there were also numbers for 2018 and 2019. And I'm just sort of aware your run rating well behind these, both for 2018 and sort of the expected 2019 performance in both Downstream and Chemicals. Can you sort of help us with how much of this is macro and how much of this is unplanned downtime? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, Al, so let me just say this. The market environment is very different than what we had. We assumed 2017 flat conditions. And in the Chemicals business very different. Well, actually Chemicals and Downstream both very different margin environment. But the underlying activity that we talked about on those projections is on track. That's why I was saying these milestones of these projects starting up. So the underlying activity that's driving these earnings results that we're \u2013 these earnings projections, earnings potential projections that we talked about in March are all there. As a matter of fact again, I think we're seeing a bit of upside. So don't know in terms of \u2013 can't give you any definite numbers in terms of earnings themselves, but I can tell you the activity is going well. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: So you would see it more as a macro then? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: And on my follow-up, can you just talk around IMO? In particular, if you see scope for an emergence of compliant blends, particularly in the Asian region? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: I don't know if I can answer that question specifically. But I can just tell you that we're supportive of the timing. We think that the industry will be able to adapt. We think it's the right thing to do in terms of going from 3.5% sulfur down to 0.5%. And we're going to be ready. And we're going to be ready with a bunch of different options. So as I mentioned, we'll still have HSFO, we'll have a low sulfur fuel as well, we'll have a marine gas oil, and we'll have LNG. To the extent that some ships convert to LNG, we'll have that as well. And then also we have a lot of coking capacity that will be churning out some \u2013 destroying that distillate and churning \u2013 destroying that resid and churning out some high-quality distillate. So I think we're going to be ready. And we're looking forward to that environment. So I can't really tell you anything specific about what others are doing or what the markets are doing. Going to be hard to see how that \u2013 what the impacts are going to be on that overall. Obviously, the clean/dirty spread is going to grow. And we don't know how much and don't know for how long. So I think the industry is going to deal with it just fine. Alastair R. Syme - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, thank you. Good morning. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Hey, Roger. Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess the question earlier was asked about buying things or whatever. And you detailed in the fourth quarter some of the asset sales coming through on the Downstream side. I was wondering, in a market where oil prices have recovered, you clearly are focused on the investment side, but everything has to compete for capital. Do you see any acceleration potential in dispositions over the next couple of years? And particularly as the Upstream starts to transition with a greater component from the lower 48, if that makes it an easier decision to move forward on asset sales? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, let me just \u2013 we kind of hinted at this and talked about it a little bit back in March and certainly in dialogue. I think we've all been having \u2013 we've been saying that we are going to be more active in terms of looking at our Upstream assets. And as we bring on \u2013 as you mentioned, as we bring on all these high-quality assets and invest in these new accretive volumes clearly we need to be looking at the other end of the portfolio and seeing what might be worth more to somebody else than it is to us, given where our portfolio is heading. So we are already more active and we'll continue to be more active in that area. What I can't give you is any specifics right now in terms of the timing, in terms of how those transactions, when those transactions may happen. Obviously, we need to have an active buyer as well as a seller. But we have had some \u2013 and if you think about what we've announced year to date with the Norway divestment that was last year and then Scarborough and the Rockies gas, that we have been active. And that activity is going to continue to ramp up. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for that, Jack, and I appreciate the greater disclosure Exxon is giving. But I didn't really expect you to give me a list of projects that you were going to be unloading here. As a follow-up \u2013 oh, sorry. Just as a quick follow-up, the question about share repos was asked. But I was wondering since you mentioned debt had declined to $40 billion, lowest since 2015, I was just curious. Is there a debt goal, debt-to-cap, net debt, total debt number, recapturing the top credit rating? Any of that kind of drivers that we should think about in terms of where debt goes down the road? Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. This is Neil, Roger. I'll take that one. We don't target a specific credit rating. We don't target a specific debt level. Again, I think the aim or the goal is to ensure that we maintain financial strength, financial capacity, so that we can act countercyclically. We can take advantage of investment opportunities regardless of the price cycle. But aiming or putting a specific target out there, we don't typically do that. But again, we already have a very \u2013 as you know, we have industry leading strength on the balance sheet. And then we want to maintain that, so we can take advantage of opportunities, but we don't target any specific debt level or credit rating. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: And we view it as a competitive advantage, Roger. I mean you can imagine it gives us a lot of capacity to use that balance sheet when we see accretive opportunities. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, thank you, Roger. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob West with Redburn. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Oh, hi. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to ask the first one about the comments you made earlier around your Downstream investments. And the question is, are you surprised how little some of your peers are investing in new either capacity or complexity at their refining base? And could you just make some comments about why you think that might be, if it is a trend that you are seeing? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, I would just say, mildly, yes, surprised. But I don't really know why. I mean I think that's something you'd have to ask them. One thing I would like to say though, is as we think about refining investments, we're really not interested in kind of plain vanilla industry standard refining at an industry standard unit, that conversion capacity, that kind of thing. We're bringing proprietary technology and/or footprint advantages on all those projects we had. So they are all well in excess of what others might see on their potential refining investments. And I think that probably differentiates us. In addition to that, you look at some of the differentiated products we have coming out as well. So I think that may be a reason why. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Okay. Thank you. Just second one would be on digital. And really the question is, what is your number one highlight in the digital space in the last 12 months? And the context for asking is, I've seen one of your peers talk about having 20 million data points a day at a new Gulf of Mexico platform. And I've seen one of your other peers just signed a big new agreement with a machine-learning company. Is there something that you'd point to in that space? Or would you say it's less active than peers there? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Well, let me \u2013 Neil might want to weigh in on this one too, but let me just make a comment. I can assure you we are very active in this space. We have had a lot of discussions at the management committee level around all the things we're doing in digital. We are not rushing out to do a me-too type project in digital. But we are putting in the underlying infrastructure to give us advanced analytic capabilities. We are doing things like pervasive Wi-Fi in our facilities to where we can make our operators much more productive. We have real-time data feeding in from all our major pieces of equipment that's improving reliability. So we are \u2013 we don't \u2013 you're right. We haven't talked about it as much as some of our competitors, but we are very active in the space. All aspects of our business have big digital organizations in them, looking at all that opportunity. And that's coordinated with a central IT organization that's looking at the overall strategy. So very active, and we are seeing some bottom-line benefits for sure. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: And maybe one example I can give. You look at what we're doing on the subsurface. And you can imagine over time how much seismic data we've collected as a company. And so one of the areas we're looking at is digitizing that. And again, with the idea of using artificial intelligence and big data to help us continue to look for resources. That's one specific example. But again, I think it's happening across the business. Rob West - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.: Thank you. Thank you for those perspectives. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Good. Thank you, Rob. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Okay. We'll take our last question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in at the end of the call. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah, good morning, Jason. Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: Firstly, just on \u2013 yeah, morning. Just on the Brazil acreage footprint expanding here. Can you first remind us, of that $1 billion, how much has been spent year to date? And secondly on that, there haven't really been many updates on the Carcara development. Can you give us any updates that you have? Or how you're thinking about this project coming along, given not much coming from you or your partners in that project? Jack P. Williams - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Yeah. Let me handle the last part of the question, and maybe Neil could chime in on the numerics on the investments this year. On Carcara, we're working with Equinor on that, as they're operating that development. And again, we see that as a recoverable resource of more than 2 billion barrels of high-quality oil. We've had another on-block discovery that could increase that further. So it's looking good, continuing to progress. We're still talking, continuing to talk about what's the optimum development plan and timing on that. But we see it as very attractive. I think we both absolutely agree it's very attractive. And we see that as kind of being a 2023, 2024-type start-up, depending on a number of factors on the permits and when we get going there. But one thing I'd like to mention is that I talked about 26 blocks in Brazil. And all these are blocks we went after because we saw on seismic some attractive features that we wanted to look at a lot harder. The only thing we had in our outlook from Brazil that's been included in those earning projection outlook we talked about back in March is just the one Carcara. Everything else in Brazil is complete upside to the outlook we had. And we do see it as very, very prospective. We're very excited about the program now. We're probably going to spend the rest of this year, next year acquiring additional 3D seismic, interpreting that. Maybe 2020 before we're out there drilling new exploration wells. But we see they're very prospective. And we're very excited about the opportunities there. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Right. Maybe I can give you a little perspective on year to date. So again, with the acquisition of the Tit\u00e3 block, which was roughly 71,000 acres, we're now up to 2.3 million net. I think year-to-date approximate numbers will be \u2013 I think full year will be around $2 billion, which is again about $1 billion above what we had in plan. And Jack mentioned the 26 blocks that we're in. I think the other thing that's attractive is we operate approximately 66% of those blocks. And then most of them are under concession contracts as well. So a very attractive position. Jason Gabelman - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Great. Thanks a lot. Neil A. Hansen - Exxon Mobil Corp.: Great. Thank you, Jason, and thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight a third quarter that included strong earnings and cash flow performance, supported by improved operations and significant liquids growth. I'd also like to remind you that our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods, will participate in our fourth quarter and full year earnings review. We appreciate your continued interest, and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir. Neil Hansen : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation on the call and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods. As we\u2019ll discuss on the call today, we are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and with our full year results. This was a quarter highlighted by continued value generation from our integrated business model, additional growth in liquids production and successful highgrading of our downstream portfolio. In addition, we made significant progress on investments that will generate long-term accretive value for our shareholders. After I review the quarterly financial and operating performance, Darren will provide his perspectives on our business reflecting on 2018 and the year ahead. Following this, Darren and I will be happy to take your questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our Web site. I\u2019d also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation, which starting this quarter you\u2019ll notice includes a listing of significant non-operational events that impacted quarterly earnings. Moving to Slide 3, I\u2019ll now highlight the developments that influenced fourth quarter performance. Crude oil prices decreased during the quarter with Brent down $7.51 and WTI down $10.62. Conversely, gas realizations were up in the fourth quarter supported by strong LNG prices and seasonal demand. Henry Hub was also up $0.74. Production in the Permian increased another 12% relative to the third quarter and was up 93% from the fourth quarter of last year. Exploration success continued offshore Guyana with the Pluma discovery, our 10th find so far on the Stabroek block. The resource estimate in Guyana is now greater than 5 billion oil equivalent barrels. In Mozambique, we secured offtake agreements for the Rovuma LNG project as we progress toward a final investment decision which remains on track. Industry refining margins weakened across the globe with lower seasonal gasoline demand and higher inventories. This was partly offset by stronger distillate margins. In North America, we successfully leveraged our logistics capacity to capture significant value by moving advantaged crudes from the Permian and Western Canada to our manufacturing facilities. We also started up the third of our six key refinery projects, advanced hydrocracker at our Rotterdam refinery. This advantaged investment increases our capacity to produce higher value products, including ultra-low sulfur fuels and Group II premium lubricant base stocks. We continue to highgrade our downstream portfolio with the divestment of our Augusta refinery and related terminals in Italy and our Germany retail assets. Our long-term fundamentals remained strong in the chemical business, margins weakened during the quarter. The supply length from recent capacity additions pressured realizations. We safely completed a turnaround at our Singapore facility and progressed integration of our Jurong acquisition with our nearby petrochemical complex. I\u2019ll now go through a more detailed review of fourth quarter results, starting first with the upstream on Slide 4. Fourth quarter upstream earnings were $3.3 billion, a $900 million decrease relative to the third quarter of 2018. The absence of favorable U.S. tax reform impacts and current quarter asset impairments negatively impacted earnings by $670 million. Crude realizations decreased by 18% during the quarter with a decline in industry markers and wider North American differentials. The estimated unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on upstream earnings relative to the third quarter was $350 million. However, integration with logistics and manufacturing resulted in more than that value being realized in the downstream. Having takeaway capacity that exceeds our upstream production allowed us to realize a corresponding estimated benefit again relative to the third quarter of approximately $600 million in the downstream. Gas realizations increased 18% in the fourth quarter on stronger LNG pricing and seasonal gas demand. An increase in production driven by a continued volume growth in the Permian and seasonal gas demand in Europe contributed $660 million to fourth quarter earnings. Favorable foreign exchange effects and other items each positively impacted earnings by $100 million. Moving to Slide 5 and a comparison of fourth quarter upstream production to the third quarter of this year. Production in the fourth quarter was 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of more than 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. If you exclude the impact of entitlements and divestments, volumes were up 5% as a result of seasonal gas demand and continued liquids growth. The absence of impacts from the downtime event that occurred earlier this year at Syncrude and volume growth in the Permian resulted in a 3% increase in liquids production in the fourth quarter. Natural gas production was up 11% primarily due to seasonal gas demand in the Netherlands. Moving to Slide 6 and a comparison of fourth quarter upstream earnings with the fourth quarter of 2017. If you exclude the effects of U.S. tax reform and impairments, earnings increased $1.2 billion. Higher prices increased earnings by $660 million driven by a $2 increase in natural gas realizations, partly offset by a decline in crude realizations and again that resulted primarily from wider North American differentials. We estimate the unfavorable impact of those wider differentials on the upstream again relative to the fourth quarter of last year to be approximately $750 million. The estimated corresponding margin benefit that we captured in the downstream from our fully integrated value chain was $1.2 billion, again compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Liquids growth, driven by Permian and Hebron, increased earnings by $180 million. Favorable foreign exchange effects contributed approximately $80 million while all other impacts increased earnings by $270 million. Those other items included favorable non-U.S. impacts and the absence of unfavorable one-time items from last year and that was partly offset by some higher operating and exploration expenses. Slide 7 provides a comparison of fourth quarter volumes relative to the same period as last year. Liquids production increased 7%, excluding the impact from entitlements and divestments. That growth included a 93% increase in Permian production and additional volumes from Hebron. Now while not shown on the page, I also wanted to highlight that full year production was 3.8 million barrels per day. And if you exclude the effect of entitlements and divestments of approximately 130,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, volumes finished the year essentially in line with 2017 levels and the guidance we provided at the March 2018 Investor Day. Now moving to Slide 8, I\u2019ll review downstream fourth quarter financial and operating results starting first with a comparison to the third quarter of this year. Downstream earnings of $2.7 billion increased by $1 billion with a capture of significant value from our North American integrated operations and portfolio highgrading. Downstream refining margins weakened during the quarter; however, this was more than offset by the value we captured from North American crude differentials with our integrated logistics network. This allowed us to connect barrels to our manufacturing facilities and contributed to a favorable margin impact in the downstream of approximately $500 million. We had higher scheduled maintenance in the quarter, which decreased earnings by $460 million. Proceeds from the divestment of Germany retail assets and the Augusta refinery and fuels terminals contributed $870 million to earnings. Improvements in refining yield and sales mix, supported by the startups of the Beaumont hydrofiner and the Antwerp coker partly offset by some related expenses, contributed $70 million to earnings. All other items included favorable inventory impacts and tax items. Turning now to Slide 9 and a review of current quarter downstream earnings relative to the fourth quarter of last year. And if you exclude the effects of U.S. tax reform and impairments, downstream earnings were up almost $1.8 billion. Margins had a $550 million positive impact on earnings with significant value from wider crude differentials in North America. And in fact we estimate a benefit across the integrated downstream value chain of approximately $1.2 billion relative to the same quarter as last year. This was partly offset by lower lubricants margins and lower refining margins in some regions. Significant reliability improvement was partly offset by higher scheduled maintenance resulting in a positive contribution of $130 million. The divestment of the Germany retail assets and the Augusta refinery and fuels terminals, which was partly offset by the absence of a Norway retail divestment that occurred in 2017, contributed $680 million in the fourth quarter. Improvements in refining yield and sales mix, with the startup of new refinery investments and a growing retail network in markets like Mexico, partly offset by some related expenses resulted in a positive contribution of $200 million. All other items reflect favorable inventory impacts and tax. Turning now to Slide 10 and a review of current quarter chemical earnings relative to the third quarter of this year. Fourth quarter chemical earnings were $737 million. Lower margins negatively impacted earnings by $110 million as polyolefin margins declined as lengthening supply from new industry capacity additions. We had a one-time non-U.S. tax impact that resulted in a positive contribution of $210 million. Other items included higher expenses from new assets and growth initiatives. Turning now to Slide 11 and a review of current quarter chemical earnings relative to the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding the effects of U.S. tax reform and impairments, chemical earnings decreased $190 million from the prior year quarter. Lower margins resulted in a $350 million decrease, again driven by lengthening polyolefin supply with new industry capacity. An increase in polyethylene sales from new assets had a positive contribution to earnings of $100 million. Scheduled turnaround activities in Singapore, which we completed in the fourth quarter, had a negative impact of $90 million. The same one-time non-U.S. tax impact resulted in a positive contribution of $210 million, while all other items included higher expenses from new assets and growth initiatives. Slide 12 provides a review of sources and uses of cash. Fourth quarter earnings adjusted for depreciation expense, changes in working capital and asset sales gains yielded $8.6 billion in cash flow from operating activities. And it\u2019s important to note that depreciation in the quarter was higher than the normal trend line due to the previously mentioned current quarter asset impairment of approximately $700 million on a before tax basis. We experienced a $1.3 billion negative working capital impact in the quarter. This was driven by an inventory build for planned maintenance in the downstream and some seasonal tax payments, mostly in Europe. Other non-cash items of approximately $1 billion included adjustments for gains on the fourth quarter divestment in Germany and Italy. As a reminder, although both the Germany and Augusta divestments occurred in the fourth quarter, we actually received the cash proceeds from the Germany divestment in the third quarter. Had those proceeds been received this quarter, our cash from operations and asset sales would have fully covered investments and distributions. Fourth quarter PP&E additions were $6.5 billion driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian Basin. We also reduced debt in the quarter by $2.3 billion. I\u2019ll now move to Slide 13, which summarizes full year 2018 financial results. 2018 earnings, excluding the impacts from U.S. tax reform and impairments, were $21 billion, up 40% from the prior year driven by higher prices, liquids growth and a value from North American integration. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $40 billion, including $4 billion in proceeds from asset sales. Now that $4 billion in asset sales was slightly above the previous five-year average that we have of asset sales of about $3.3 billion. 2018 CapEx was $26 billion, $2 billion above the guidance provided at last year\u2019s Investor Day, largely driven by incremental acquisitions during the year and notably related to Brazilian acreage in the upstream and the Indonesian lubricants company that we acquired in the downstream. Free cash flow after investments was $20 billion, more than enough to cover the $14 billion in dividends paid during the year. Debt ended the year at $38 billion, a $4.5 billion decrease compared to the end of 2017. Now let me provide a few observations regarding the first quarter before I hand it over to Darren. Upstream volumes should be largely consistent with fourth quarter levels. In the downstream, we are seeing significantly weaker industry refining margins with lower seasonal gasoline demand and excess production. In addition, the curtailments in Canada coupled with additional logistics capacity coming on line in the Permian have led to much narrower crude differentials to start the year. While these changes will impact results versus the fourth quarter, they again demonstrate the advantage of integration as opportunities open and close across the markets along the value chain we are positioned to capture them. Scheduled maintenance this year will be like what we experienced in 2018 with the level of activity in the first quarter similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018. Chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure as the market continues to work through supply length from recent capacity additions. We expect quarterly corporate and financing charges to be somewhere between $700 million and $900 million. And finally, we do expect any significant asset sales in the first quarter. At this time, I would like to hand it over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Great to be on the call today. Let me just start by providing my perspective on the past year. I think as you all know and will recall in March of last year, we laid out an investment plan to structurally improve the earnings and cash flow potential of our business, while improving our returns across the wide range of price environments. As I reflect on 2018, I am extremely pleased with the progress we have made on those plans. We not only delivered on our commitments for the year, we identified additional upside. The price environment in 2018 was unpredictable which once again demonstrated the value of our integrated business model. We saw significant swings in commodity prices compounded by the transportation constraints in the Permian Basin in Western Canada. Our upstream integrated logistics and manufacturing position allowed us to avoid the impact of market dislocations and thus capture the full value of our barrels. This reflects a deliberate strategy to leverage the scale and breadth of our integrated business model, which certainly paid off in 2018. Against a backdrop of a fairly volatile margin and price environment, we met earnings expectations for the year and generated $40 billion in cash flow from operations and asset sales, the highest level since 2014. This in turn enabled us to fund our ongoing investment program, reduce the debt and consistent with one of our longstanding priorities increase the dividend. In 2018, we increased our dividend by 6% marking the 36th consecutive year of increases. Essential to our plans for growing value is the advancement of a portfolio of advantaged investments. Throughout the year we continued to develop and rigorously test our investments to make sure that our company\u2019s competitive advantages were translating directly into project advantages giving us some of industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply. Developments over the past year have reaffirmed our belief in the strength of our investment portfolio, which is the best we have seen since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. In fact, as we worked through the year, we identified significant upside to our plans, which brings me to a critical focus area of 2018 delivering on the project milestones for the plans that we laid out back in March. We remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver on our plans and let me give you a brief overview of the advances that we made in 2018. I\u2019ll start with the upstream. Each of the five growth opportunities we outlined back in March saw significant progress over the year. In Guyana, our track record of exploration success continued with five additional discoveries during the year resulting in an updated resource estimate of more than 5 billion oil equivalent barrels. With our success, we added another drillship to accelerate the pace of exploration and appraisal drilling. We now see the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 barrels per day by 2025. Another key focus for deepwater development is Brazil where we have quickly built an industry leading acreage position. Since the Investor Day last year, we increased our acreage position to 2.3 million net acres. In the Permian, we continue to expand and accelerate activities. We believe we have a unique opportunity here to bring the full strength of ExxonMobil to the development of unconventional resources, to bring scale, bring fundamental science and technology, bring large scale efficient development and bring an integrated well to market approach. It\u2019s one of the reasons we moved XTO to Houston, to integrate their work and skills into the broader capabilities of ExxonMobil. It\u2019s why we believe our approach will deliver the lowest cost supply and give us a significant advantage over the rest of industry. As we have optimized our development with further drilling and delineation, we see additional upside well beyond the growth trajectory that we shared previously. We\u2019ll discuss this in more detail in March when we meet at our Investor Day. We continue to make good progress on projects in our LNG portfolio. PNG and Mozambique remain on track for a final investment decision. We\u2019ve also been working very closely with QP, our partner in Golden Pass to advance that investment and looking forward to announcing something here in the very near term. In the downstream, the widening crude differentials in North America are a good reminder for why it\u2019s important to keep our growth plans for the Permian integrated with our logistics and manufacturing footprint in the Gulf Coast. We\u2019ve been very active in securing additional takeaway capacity for our production in the Permian as well as putting plans in place to ensure that our logistics capacity grows in tandem with our production and refining expansions. To meet growing demand for higher value fuels and lubricants, we are progressing six major refining investments, all advantage versus industry. Over the past year, three of those facilities started up, namely the Beaumont hydrofiner, Antwerp delayed coker and the Rotterdam advanced hydrocracker. These projects significantly enhance the earnings and cash flow capacity of our downstream business and position us well for the upcoming IMO spec changes next year. The remaining three projects are progressing in line with the plans that we shared in March. In our chemical business, we outlined plans for 13 new facilities to meet growing demand; seven have been brought on line, the remaining six are on schedule. We expect these investments to support a 30% growth in sales by 2025, driven by our proprietary technologies that provide advantage products and applications. We made excellent progress towards this objective in 2018 with sales growth of 6%. As we said last March, all of our investments leverage some combination of our competitive advantages to deliver industry leading returns. Technology almost always plays a critical role. A great example is our advanced hydrocracker project in Rotterdam. The project uses a first-in-the-world combination of proprietary process and catalyst technology to convert heavy intermediate streams into Group II base stocks, a significant upgrade. With this investment, Rotterdam becomes the only world-scale Group II base stock producer in Europe and it supplements our Group II production in the U.S. and Asia allowing us to more effectively serve our global customer base. We expect this one product alone to double earnings for the Rotterdam site making it one of the most competitive refineries in Europe. As we speak today, the hydrocracker is up and running and producing on-spec product in line with our expectations. We shift now to 2019 and some key themes for the year ahead. Starting in the upstream, we expect to sanction a number of key projects, including the next two phases of Guyana, Liza 2 and Payara as well as two significant LNG projects, Mozambique and Golden Pass. Let me just add here too that we advance the FID at Payara in the middle of 2020 to late 2019, again reflecting the development plans and the progress that we\u2019re making beyond the plans we laid out last year. Later this year we plan to mobilize the FPSO for the first development of phase in Guyana putting us on track for an early 2020 startup. With the advances we made in our Permian development plans, we expect to accelerate the pace of our investments and increase our production profile. Consistent with this, this week we announced a final investment decision for the Beaumont refinery expansion which will further add to our integrated Permian advantage. We also announced the formation of the Wink to Webster JV to progress the Permian long haul pipeline that will give both Baytown and Beaumont the industry\u2019s most efficient transportation link to the Permian. We brought three important refinery projects on in the back end of last year. In 2019, our focus will be on fully leveraging their advantages. In addition, we\u2019re going to continue our push into new growth markets like Mexico and Indonesia ensuring that we capitalize fully on our brands. In the chemical business, we\u2019re on track for a midyear startup of our Beaumont polyethylene expansion further strengthening our position in the Gulf Coast. We also plan to FID two projects at Baytown that will produce Vistamaxx which is a high growth, high performance propylene plastomer and linear alpha olefins used in packaging oils, waxes and other specialty chemicals. These projects, along with the others we\u2019ve discussed, will allow us to continue to grow sales of high value, high performance products. As I step back and reflect on the opportunities we have across all three of our business sectors, I remain very excited by the potential to generate significant value for our shareholders. As you may have seen yesterday, we announced the formation of new upstream and project organizations. These new organizations will help to facilitate the successful delivery of our investment opportunities. The upstream is reorganizing into three companies, down from seven. The upstream oil and gas company will have five distinct global businesses. Each business will have full accountability for end-to-end results from resource development to production to marketing over the entire life of the resource, from discovery to abandonment. The upstream integrated solutions company will provide functional expertise to bring the full advantage of the company\u2019s scale, our technology and experience to each global business. Third company, upstream business development, will receive the upstream strategy and activities to upgrade the asset portfolio through explorations, acquisitions and divestments. This will increase the focus on portfolio optimization and ensure that we continue to aggressively pursue all available value-added opportunities, including divestments. We\u2019re also combining project organizations from the upstream, downstream and chemical into one global projects company which will allow us to more effectively leverage the company\u2019s proven project capabilities\u2026 [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Please stand by while we reestablish our audio speaker line. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We\u2019re about to reconnect the main speaker line. Please stand by. Neil Hansen : We understand the webcast dropped. We apologize for that. So we\u2019re going to turn it back to Darren and let him finish and then we\u2019ll take Q&A. Darren Woods : I\u2019ll try to pick up where I understand we dropped off which was turning to 2019 perspectives in the chemical business. I was saying that we\u2019re on track for a midyear startup of our Beaumont polyethylene expansion which is going to further strengthen our position in the Gulf Coast. We\u2019re also planning to FID two projects at Baytown that will produce Vistamaxx which is a high growth, high performance propylene plastomer and linear alpha olefins used in packaging oils, waxes and some other specialty chemicals. These projects, along with the others we\u2019ve discussed, will allow us to continue to grow sales of high value, high performance products. As I step back and reflect on the opportunities we have across all three of our business sectors, I\u2019m very excited by the potential to generate significant value for our shareholders. You may have seen yesterday that we announced the formation of new upstream and project organizations. These new organizations will help to facilitate the successful delivery of our investment opportunities. The upstream is reorganizing into three companies, down from seven. The upstream oil and gas company will have five distinct global businesses. Each business will have full accountability for end-to-end results from resource development to production to marketing over the life of the resource, from discovery to abandonment. The upstream integrated solutions company will provide functional expertise to bring the full advantage of the company\u2019s scale, our technology and experience to each global business. The third company, upstream business development, will oversee the upstream strategy and activities to upgrade the asset portfolio through explorations, acquisitions and divestments. This will increase the focus on portfolio optimization and ensure that we continue to aggressively pursue all available value-added opportunities, including divestments. We\u2019re also combining the project organizations from the upstream, downstream and chemical into one global projects company which will allow us to more effectively leverage the company\u2019s proven project capabilities across our entire investment portfolio. Now we had already implemented many of the concepts behind a new design about a year to 18 months ago, the Permian development and the chemical cracker in Corpus are two great examples of what came from that. Rewiring the organization will allow us to sustain the new way of working to make it easier to leverage across all of our businesses and opportunities. In addition, it will improve the upstream integration with our downstream and chemical businesses. This is particularly important given the growth and value of opportunities we are capturing. With the increased upside, particularly in the Permian and Guyana, we expect CapEx to be $3 billion in 2019, an increase of about $2 billion from the guidance we gave in March. Before I hand it back to Neil, let me just offer a few closing thoughts. We remain fully committed to growing shareholder value. That commitment is the driving force behind the growth plans that we\u2019ve shared with you. We feel good about the progress we made in 2018 and the delivery on our commitments. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our forward plans and are very excited about the additional upsides. The management team and I are looking forward to reaffirming the plans we laid out last year and sharing additional detail on the upside when we meet next month at our Investor Day. With that, let me hand it back to Neil. Neil Hansen : Thank you for your comments, Darren. We\u2019ll try again on Q&A \u2013 we\u2019ll turn it over now for any questions you might have. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woods and Mr. Hansen. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning, guys, and congratulations on your results and your progress. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Doug. Good morning. Doug Terreson : So, Darren, while the returns profile of your investment portfolio looks to be pretty strong, I think you highlighted that as the super majors refocused on areas of competitive advantage during the past decade or so that you use divestitures as a fairly productive capital management tool. And on this point, while you guys have had divestitures too, your activity levels have been below peers whether including BP which obviously had an event or not. And so you talked about this a minute ago. I just want to see if you will elaborate on your comments about divestitures as a portfolio management tool or portfolio optimization tool I think is the way you termed it, whether there\u2019s a philosophical reason why ExxonMobil hasn\u2019t been as active as some of the peers and whether divestitures might be more prominent for you guys in the future given the restructuring that you highlighted? Darren Woods : Sure. Thanks, Doug. Thanks for the question. Happy to spend some time talking about that. I think we made reference to it last March. One of the advantages that we have today is as the prices came off in the backend of 2014 and we leaned into the markets and as we\u2019ve talked about loaded up our pipeline of investment opportunity with some very attractive projects, that has allowed us to re-optimize and look at the total value of portfolio. If you go back in time, we\u2019ve had a pretty regular divestment program investing about $50 billion worth of assets since 2008. What we can now in the upstream with this additional project and these investment opportunities we have is increase the focus there. So I would expect to see more activity in divestments in the upstream side of the portfolio. That\u2019s going to be driven really by the opportunities that the market brings. We\u2019ve got I think a pipeline of assets that we think would make sense to market. We\u2019re actively doing that and we\u2019ll see as we go through the year what opportunities kind of come to fruition. I would add though, Doug, that this is a value play. We\u2019re not trying to hit some schedule associated with it. We\u2019re really trying to make sure that we can realize the maximum value out of the assets that we have in our portfolio. As I mentioned, the new organization is going to help us with that. Doug Terreson : No, I\u2019m sure. Thanks a lot, Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Doug. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Doug. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hi. Good morning, Darren, and thanks for being on the call today. I guess the first question would be around you talked about some areas where capital spending is moving higher and your Permian rig count has certainly accelerated versus what you talked about in March. So without getting too far ahead what you want to talk about at the Analyst Day, maybe you could talk about at least how you\u2019re thinking about 2019? Are you comfortable with the level that you\u2019re running at now or do you see further opportunity? Darren Woods : Yes. Hi, Phil, thanks. What I will say if you look at 2018 and as Neil mentioned the additional CapEx we spent there was really the acquisition of a couple \u2013 in a couple areas Brazilian acreage and then we had I think a real nice opportunity in Indonesia to supplement our lubricants business. And so I think ex the acquisitions that weren\u2019t built into the plan, we were pretty much in line with where we expected to be on CapEx. As I just said, going into 2019 we expect to be around 30 billion and that does reflect the progress and the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in Guyana, the upside that we\u2019ve seen there as well as the Permian. We just talked a little bit about the Permian because I think one of the things we\u2019ve challenged ourselves with and looking at the unconventional resources is what value, what unique value can ExxonMobil bring to this resource play? And so we have spent the year really making sure that we understand the play that we\u2019ve got, doing some delineation but at the same time leveraging the full capability of ExxonMobil to bring scale and scale development along with technology \u2013 additional technology and research into the Permian. So I think what you\u2019ll hear in March is a good overview around how ExxonMobil is uniquely coming into unconventional resources to make this a low cost, long-term successful development play. Phil Gresh : Okay. And I guess just my second question would be on chemicals. That would be if you think about 2018, that was an area I think you expected to see some earnings growth in '18 and that was bit more challenging. So maybe you could just talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing both from macro factors but whether maybe there are any company specific factors there as well, or if it\u2019s all just kind of a macro situation? Darren Woods : Yes. I think in the chemical business and across all of them frankly, one of the points we try to make at the analyst meeting is we don\u2019t try to take a position on price for margins and where things are going to be. We try to make sure that the investments we\u2019re making are robust to the cycles that we see in these businesses and are aligned with, one, our advantages but, two, the long-term potential for these businesses. So if I look at chemical, the growth that we see in chemical remained \u2013 and the foundational elements of that business in industry remained very strong, continue to see demand growth above GDP going out into the future. Saw that in 2018, 4% demand growth, so very comfortable with what we see as the macro trends from a demand standpoint in chemicals. The challenge that we saw in 2018 I think will carry some into 2019 is the amount of supply that\u2019s come on. If you look at the demand growth and focus on stream crackers for a minute, you probably need about three to four world-scale steam crackers every year to keep up with demand. In 2018, I think six came on. So a lot more supply than what the annual growth would be, but the industry will grow out of that. And we positioned ourselves to make sure that we capture that long-term growth. We don\u2019t get overly focused on the timing of every project and when they\u2019re going to show up. Those things shift around a bit. We\u2019ve got more projects \u2013 industry projects coming on in 2019. That timing will move around and I think we\u2019ll see margins move with the timing of that new supply coming on. But again, I think the current environment is not a concern for us. We\u2019ve leveraged \u2013 all those projects we\u2019ve put in place have leveraged our advantages and made sure that we\u2019re on the low cost of supply. So irrespective of where we\u2019re at in the cycle, we\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thank you. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Phil. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning. Sam Margolin : You touched on this a little bit, Darren, in your perspective section and Neil quantified it too with the integration benefit of $1.2 billion. But I was hoping to ask you to elaborate a little bit in the context of the pipeline and the refinery FIDs in the U.S. that were announced this week. You\u2019ve got a lot of crude coming on stream in other places and so is the fact that there\u2019s a lot of U.S. kind of value chain investment a function of trying to balance the portfolio and the U.S. is the easiest place for you to do that given your existing footprint or is there something commercially about the U.S. and where these supply chains go through that kind of makes you feel like the U.S. is a place where you really want to be an exporter of finished products and not necessarily incremental crude. Just a little bit of background on the molecules you specifically want to target in the U.S. versus internationally. Neil Hansen : We\u2019re happy to do that, Sam. Thank you and good morning. I think as we look at that and the value of integration, it is really a function of the markets that you\u2019re in and the structure of those markets. So let me just give you an example of why we think there\u2019s a big opportunity here in the Permian. It\u2019s a very fast growing area. It\u2019s inland and so you\u2019ve got key \u2013 you need key logistics to move in and out of that. And so as we\u2019re rapidly growing production in the Permian \u2013 as the industry is rapidly growing production in the Permian, there are going to be periods of disconnect as the pipeline and logistic systems try to keep up with that rapid production growth. Our view is we don\u2019t want to be exposed to those disconnects and so we have been looking across our integrated chain. And one of the advantages that ExxonMobil has is we can see across that whole value chain because we participate along the whole value chain. And so making sure that as we are developing our plans in the Permian, at the same time we\u2019re developing our plans and our logistic system\u2019s developing the plans in the refineries so that we make sure that that stays connected. The refinery investments that we\u2019re making stands somewhat alone. They accommodate our production but they\u2019re somewhat alone and disconnected from our physical molecules. The opportunity there is just take advantage of the transportation differential between bringing crude in from West Texas in the Permian versus importing it in from some of the locations. So the margins and what we expect to get out of the refinery expansion is just really a transportation differential in play. And that combined with our advantages make those attractive. So when you look at us and hear us talking a lot about the integration, it is really with Western Canada crude and in Permian because of the specific nature of those markets. And some of the other markets we\u2019re in, we are close to Tidewater, we don\u2019t have the same kind of market dynamics. That value doesn\u2019t manifest itself as explicitly. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks so much. And then just a quick follow up. You mentioned the small step up in CapEx in 2018 versus your Analyst Day guidance was a function of some acquisitions, some opportunistic acquisitions you had specifically in Brazil. Going forward, are you going to try to pair asset sales with opportunistic acquisitions like that or are these adds just a function of returns and there\u2019s no sort of cash balancing consideration at work here as well? Darren Woods : Yes, I would tell you we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t have a formula where we\u2019re trying to balance ins and outs. It really comes back to maximizing value. So if we see an acquisition, an opportunity there that we think has some high potential and is accretive to value, we\u2019re going to pursue that. I\u2019d also say at the same time we recognize as we bring more attractive opportunities into our portfolio. That gives us an opportunity to trade out some of the existing assets. And the more we bring in and frontend load the pipeline and we prioritize across the highest value investment opportunities, by definition some will get moved out. As we move those assets and those projects back, we have the opportunity to trade on that. Others than don\u2019t have the same pipeline of opportunities that we do, we\u2019ll see a higher value sooner and gives us a chance to trade. So I would expect to see that ramp up and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to constrain ourselves to try to balance those things out. But I\u2019d expect to see more divestments coming out upstream. And I know Neil Chapman and his team are very focused on that. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thank you so much. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Sam. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning and thanks Darren for being on the call today. The first question I had was just on the base business. And can you just talk about outside of the major capital projects when you think about the balance of the existing portfolio how you see declines playing out from here? What are you doing to mitigate those declines and talk about some of the larger legacy assets like Groningen where we have seen some volume declines and how do you intend to either offset that or do you look to allow that to continue to happen as you try to maximize returns and cash flow? Darren Woods : Sure. Hi, Neil. It\u2019s good to hear from you again. Let me just say too I\u2019m happy to be on the call and spend some time talking about our business. I\u2019m real happy and pleased with how the organization has kind of come together and we\u2019ve challenged them to make sure that we\u2019re maximizing and leveraging the full capability of the corporation. One of the changes driving our upstream reorganization is to make sure that the upstream businesses have the accountability and the ownership to maximize profitability and value for their assets and for their value chain. And that philosophy, as I mentioned in my comments, have already been pushed out into the organization. And so what we\u2019re seeing in terms of short-term day-to-day operations is I think real aggressiveness looking for opportunities to grow value. I mentioned to you that we\u2019ve identified a number of upsides as we went through the year. Those were bottom up upsides as the organization really focused on where they could find and extract additional value, not just from the new projects but also from the base business. So I feel good about that. And they will make decisions day-to-day around what\u2019s economic in terms of offsetting decline and making sure that we\u2019re getting a good return for every dollar that we spend to bring that production back. With respect to Groningen, that\u2019s a slightly different dynamic as you know. Some of the tremors and the concerns, legitimate concerns expressed by the community there, we worked fairly closely with the government and made sure that we had a mechanism to kind of address those concerns in a responsible way. That agreement that we reached with the government entailed a change in the fiscals, take the fiscals for the Groningen resource back in line with the rest of the gas business and the Netherlands. And so I think all of that has been reflected in our go-forward plans and very comfortable that what we\u2019re doing and the growth that we\u2019ve got will more than offset any reduction that we see there. Neil Mehta : I appreciate it. And the follow-up question is just on Liza. As we talked about in Miami, it sounds like you guys are full steam ahead towards that 750,000 barrel a day long-term target. Do you see potential upside to that base case number? And then curious how you\u2019re thinking about the timing of phase 2 especially given some of the uncertainty from a political perspective down in Guyana? Darren Woods : Yes, we still feel really confident about what we\u2019re doing there and advancing Liza. I think as we\u2019ve talked about already with the discoveries that we\u2019ve announced, we see additional FPSOs there. And that resource \u2013 we\u2019re still a long way, as I mentioned in Miami, from fully exploring the opportunities out there. So as we continue to advance that exploration we\u2019ll see how it plays out. And we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll find some additional opportunities there and that will continue to grow that resource. With respect to phase 2, Liza 2, that continues to be on track with the schedule that we\u2019ve put in place. And let me just address this \u2013 the comment that you made around the government and some of the things happening there. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind when we go into countries, we go in with a mindset that we\u2019re going to be there for a lifetime, 30 to 40 years. You can\u2019t have a successful development if you\u2019re only talking to a subset or a narrow section of your stakeholder group. So we have been engaged with the sitting government, with the opposition, with communities making sure that the development and what we\u2019re doing is understood and the people are aligned on that. So the opposition understands the contracts that we have in place. I think they understand the value that that development will bring to Guyana and the people of Guyana. So I think it\u2019s very consistent with how we think about a long-term approach to engaging with companies and countries. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Darren. We appreciate the increased transparency. Darren Woods : Sure. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Neil. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question just as you look at the LNG market, you\u2019re clearly trying to sanction a lot of projects over the next couple of years. So historically ExxonMobil have sought to secure most of the offtake before a sanction. Is that still the way you look at the market and do you have interesting [ph] observations about the changing market dynamics? Darren Woods : Thanks, Alastair. You\u2019re right. That has been the historical model. I think as you kind of make reference implicitly in your question is that market is evolving. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to evolve as quickly as some people are predicting it, but we certainly see a change. And I would anticipate as we make those investments and bring LNG on that we\u2019ll evolve along with the market and make sure that we\u2019re positioned to maximize the value of those investments. And that may mean more portfolio activity in the future. But again, we\u2019re going to pace that in that development consistent with how that market develops. Alastair Syme : Okay. Thank you. A quick follow-up question just a point of clarification on the CapEx. I think in 2018 you had around about $3 billion of acquisition capital. Does your 2019 budget incorporate something around a similar level? Is that how you think about the budget? Darren Woods : No. Typically, when we\u2019re putting together our plans, if we\u2019ve got something \u2013 a line of sight on something that we think has got a high chance of closing, we\u2019ll try to reflect some of that. If we don\u2019t have any of those, then it won\u2019t show up in the plans. So it tends to kind of vary depending on where we\u2019re at and the line of sight that we have on the opportunities. Alastair Syme : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. John Herrlin : Hi, Darren, with respect to the upstream reorg, are all these new entities or groups going to report still to Neil or do they report to the committee? Darren Woods : So the new streamlined organization, one of the big benefits that we have there is moving from seven upstream companies down to three. Those three companies and presidents will report to Neil Chapman. John Herrlin : Okay, great. Then a next one for me is I guess for Neil. Could you address what the impairments were in the U.S. and internationally upstream? Neil Hansen : Yes. So, John, as I mentioned, there were \u2013 and you can see the detail in the supplemental information as well. We had about $400 million after tax in impairments in 2018, about half of that related to a U.S. Gulf of Mexico asset and then the other half related to unconventional activity in North America. John Herrlin : Okay, I missed that. Thank you. Neil Hansen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll next move to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It was on LNG again. Could you just talk a little bit about the rationale to move forward with the Golden Pass project? And then also how that competes with some of the other options you have, particularly Mozambique, and then a potential Qatar expansion if you were to participate there? Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. Thanks, Biraj. Let me just maybe start with the philosophy of how we look at competing investments, if you will, or the opportunities within our portfolio. I\u2019ve said this before in different audiences but our strategy here and the way we make decisions on investment is those investments have to compete versus the whole of industry, not just what we have in our portfolio. So the emphasis that we put on our different projects is how do they fit in with the industry\u2019s projects and the additional capacity that they\u2019re going to bring on and make sure that those projects have the advantages needed to be on the lower end of the cost of supply curve so that they will be very competitive versus any other industry projects that come on. That\u2019s very important because as we just talked about with the chemical business in a high growth \u2013 while we see a lot of high growth opportunities in LNG, capacity will come on in big chunks. It won\u2019t be necessarily coordinated. So we\u2019ll see I suspect periods of oversupply. And so when we see that period, we\u2019re going to have to make sure that our investments are robust to lower market prices. And then as the growth continues and the market tightens up, we\u2019ll see advantages there as well. So the focus is really on making sure our projects are competitive in the landscape of the industry. With respect to Golden Pass, I think it\u2019s got a lot of strategic value. If you think about the gas business in the U.S., the quantity of gas available to the marketplace, the associated gas that comes on with some of the crude development, we continue to see from a supply standpoint a very attractive supply gas market in the U.S. For us then we\u2019ve got an opportunity to leverage our existing terminal facilities which gives us an advantage. And then it also allows us with a supply point here in the Atlantic basin in North America for a lot of optimization as we look to supply the global markets. And so I think we got some unique advantages with the existing facilities. We\u2019ve got advantages with the industry supply source here in the U.S. And then we\u2019ve got advantages in terms of a global LNG business and the ability to optimize across that whole portfolio, and including the work that we do with QP and optimization with that integrated portfolio. Biraj Borkhataria : Can I just ask a very quick follow-up? In terms of timing, you\u2019ve got Mozambique, which maybe FID 2019 and 2020, and then Golden Pass moving forward. Would you expect to \u2013 you\u2019re going to do both the developments concurrently or should we expect one to be pushed back a little bit? Darren Woods : Yes, each of them will be a function of kind of the contract availability and how that plays itself out. I\u2019ll tell you with the strong growth that we\u2019re seeing in the LNG market, lots of demand that supply is going to chase here. And so I think we\u2019ll make sure \u2013 we\u2019re going to make sure that those developments occur on a very efficient cost effective way. And as I said before with the advantages that we are building into these projects, it\u2019ll be low cost to the supply. And so less worried about what others are doing and making sure that we bring those on in a cost effective manner. Biraj Borkhataria : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Apologies, folks, I don\u2019t know if there was a technical issue on your end as well, but I had to dial back in again, so sorry about that. First of all, Darren, let me also reiterate my thanks for you getting on the call today. But I wonder if I could get preempt you a little bit on the upcoming Analyst Day. Your rig count in the Permian is about 50% above what you guided last year or at least the target for the end of the year and clearly there is multiple additional growth potential in Guyana. Is your intention at a high level to \u2013 would that notionally increase the targeted growth or would you intend to do more with less or perhaps accelerate disposals to keep the overall kind of scale of your expectations through 2025? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Doug. In March we\u2019re going to have a really comprehensive conversation about how all this pulls together. I\u2019ll tell you with what we laid out for the Permian last March that was very early into the development of that resource. And what I talked about earlier with respect to trying to leverage the capacity and the scales for not only XTO but the full ExxonMobil advantages has led us to I think a very unique concept for developing the Permian resource. And so I think \u2013 and we\u2019ll lay that out in March, talk about how we\u2019re approaching that and the investments that we\u2019re making there. So that will be kind of a story onto itself. With Guyana as we continue to see opportunities and leverage what we\u2019re already doing, there\u2019s a lot of efficiencies continuing to roll into production as we have more discoveries and find resources that we can bring on. So I think again we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019ll update you with that. But if we continue to have success in exploration, continue to build on that momentum, take advantage of the efficiencies and bring on very attractive, very low cost of supply. As all that kind of comes to fruition, our expectation is we\u2019d see more earnings and more cash and bring in more returns. And at the same time we\u2019ve got the opportunity now to kind of flex that portfolio and we\u2019ll optimize to make sure that we\u2019re not leaving any value on the table. We want to bring in NPV forward as much as possible but do it in a way that keeps cost in control and stays within the capability of our organization. So that\u2019s kind of a constant evaluation and testing that we\u2019re doing. I think the new organization that we\u2019re putting in place is going to help us more effectively advance some of these investment opportunities. So we\u2019ll kind of roll all that together and layout what the implications are going forward in March. Doug Leggate : I appreciate that. My follow-up, hopefully a quick one, is just on the reorganization. I realize your disposals this year run I think above the kind of guidance or the list guidance you\u2019ve typically given in the past about what you\u2019d expect that scale to be. Should we read the reorganization in somehow accelerate or brings forward the focus a little bit more? In other words, would you anticipate your disposal program to get even larger as you move forward? I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Darren Woods : Thanks, Doug. I think as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got the upstream business development group which is really \u2013 their focus is on what I\u2019ll call as the frontend of the pipeline, the project\u2019s portfolio and optimizing that portfolio. That I think is going to bring an additional degree of focus into that space not only from an exploration standpoint but from an acquisition as well as divestment. So I would anticipate from an upstream standpoint we will see the pace of divestments accelerate. If you step back and look at it in the context of the corporation and you go back in time, a lot of the divestments we\u2019ve seen came out of the downstream. And so the mix will change as we go forward. And then the level maybe slightly up or consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the past. Doug Leggate : I appreciate you taking my questions, guys. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you, Doug. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Good morning and like everyone else welcome to the call, Darren. Darren Woods : Thanks, Roger. Roger Read : I guess we could maybe just talk about CapEx plan this year, the 30 billion, and you\u2019re able to pay off some debt last year but I think if we were to take the CapEx back to the 30 billion level, we\u2019d be more of a neutral level in '19. And then if you adjust crude prices to the strip, we\u2019d probably be looking a little bit of a debt add in '19. I was just curious not so much whether or not you need to borrow a couple billion or pay back a couple of billion, but just understanding how you\u2019re thinking about CapEx within the overall cash flow environment and then what that could mean for increased shareholder distributions presumably at this point just on the dividend front? Darren Woods : Sure. Let me kind of maybe just remind \u2013 reemphasize the priorities that we\u2019ve got about capital allocation and how we\u2019re approaching that. First and foremost, if you\u2019re looking at the long-term value of our corporation particularly on the upstream side which is a depletion business, you\u2019ve got to have a healthy pipeline of attractive investment opportunities. And that has been one of the things that I know over the last several years the management team here has really been challenging themselves with around reloading that pipeline and making sure that we got projects and project opportunities that go way up to the future to bring value in. And our intention would be to bring those projects on, consistent with our plans, irrespective of the price environment. And the reason for that is we built those projects and tested those projects to make sure they\u2019re robust to a low price environment. So if we were to find ourselves in an environment where prices were low, that would actually I think benefit those projects in terms of as \u2013 as activity falls away in the industry, you tend to get lower cost construction. So that might play in our favor. But we would continue on that path. And then consistent with that and one of the reasons why we keep a balance sheet the way we do is to allow that to happen and not have to adjust the business up and down with the cycles. That makes for a very inefficient capital development. It also prevents you from taking advantage of the down cycle and a lot of the things that come positive from a down cycle. And so our strategy has always been to make sure that we\u2019ve got robust capital structure to support continued investment at CapEx through the cycle, making sure we\u2019ve got enough dry powder to take advantage of the down cycle if an opportunity presents itself, an acquisition opportunity potentially and at the same time make sure that our cost of leverage remains very competitive. And to do all that with investments, with our balance sheet, continue to fund reliable and growing dividend, we feel like that\u2019s an important priority for a lot of our shareholders. So that\u2019s kind of the equation. Then we get into buybacks and I\u2019ll tell you \u2013 we\u2019ve challenged ourselves on the investment front, we\u2019ve challenged ourselves on our organization and our ability to effectively deliver the advantages that we have as a corporation and to bottom line results. I think you\u2019ve seen changes there. And we\u2019re also challenging ourselves around the optimum capital structure and what we want to \u2013 make sure that we\u2019re leveraging the full advantage of that capital structure. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m very optimistic that we\u2019ve got a very strong portfolio of investments that are backed up by very strong capacity and capability of the corporation. Roger Read : Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe just as the follow up, as we think about maybe more dispositions coming from the upstream sector, how should we think about the cash flow that comes from that? Is that to reinvest in the upstream or do you think as you move forward, obviously nothing in Q1 probably, but as we think about the latter part of '19 and into '20, does the cash flow go to the balance sheet or is it CapEx supporting or is that maybe what you\u2019re thinking about in terms of getting back to more of the historical shareholder returns? Darren Woods : I would say as we progress that divestment program and to the extent we have success finding buyers out there that put a value on it that we think is attractive for a transaction, we\u2019re not waiting for that in order to fund our CapEx. Our investment program is not a function of waiting for cash to come. So I would not expect to see, as divestments progress, see that translate into additional projects in capital investment. That is an independent decision again related to some of the things I talked about in terms of the strength of the opportunities we\u2019re looking for, which then says any addition cash would come in would came to the point I just made around the optimal capital structure and whether we pay that down in debt or whether we move it out as a buyback. And as I said we\u2019re taking a real hard look at that and making sure that we\u2019re striking the right balance there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yes. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions. Firstly on Guyana, what\u2019s going on with the government there? I appreciate that you\u2019ve already addressed this question a bit, but if I could push a little deeper. If there is kind of a pause in who\u2019s running the government, are you, one, concerned that you may have to ramp down investments there; and two, is there somewhere else where you would put that money to work in if there is a potential pause or slowdown in the pace that your developing that asset? Darren Woods : Frankly, given the discussions that we\u2019ve had since really coming to Guyana with the stakeholders that we\u2019ve got across the political spectrum there, given the discussions about the advantages this development brings and the recognition of those advantages by a very wide constituency in Guyana, we really don\u2019t have any concerns about the political dynamics that are happening there. We understand that that\u2019s the nature of governments and countries around the world. We basically expect governments to change over time. Again, when you\u2019re coming into a country for 30 plus years I think it would be extremely na\u00efve to think that you\u2019re only going to have one constituency there for the timeframe. So again, we take a very broad-based approach. I think all the feedback we\u2019ve got, the alignment that we have in the country supports what we\u2019re doing here because they recognize the value that it\u2019s going to bring to Guyana. So real happy about that. And as I said, I think the phase 2 is on track, remains on track. We don\u2019t see that coming off at this point. And obviously we\u2019ll see how things develop there. But we\u2019re not particularly worried about it given the value and the strength of that investment. Jason Gabelman : That\u2019s very clear. Thanks. Secondly, just on capital spend and I appreciate the 2018 guidance that you provided. Do you have a view on 2020 and beyond is going to look like relative to the guidance you gave at your last Analyst Day? Darren Woods : Yes, Jason, I think I\u2019m going to stick with the guidance we gave for 2019. I think in a month\u2019s time we\u2019re going to kind of layout the longer-term plan again consistent with the 2025 timeframe, talk about the upgrades that we\u2019re seeing and the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing and how we\u2019re factoring that into the plan. And we\u2019ll provide a better prospective at that time. Jason Gabelman : All right. Thanks a lot. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thank you very much, gentlemen. My first question relates to the technology that you have deployed at the hydrocracker in Rotterdam. It seems to be a pretty significant uplift on margins relative to the old technology. I was just curious whether this is something that you will be able to deploy on a wider scale, or is there something unique about Rotterdam that really kind of restricts it to that location for now? Darren Woods : Thanks for the question. So what that development or that project in Rotterdam leverages is the catalysis and the technology we have, the advantages that we have in catalysis. And so that\u2019s a unique application based on our understanding and our ability to develop unique value-added catalysts. Opportunities like that exist across the portfolio. Obviously it may involve different catalysts but we\u2019ve talked about our Singapore project where we\u2019re looking at upgrading heavy residue molecules. That would also look to leverage some of this technology and use some of this proprietary catalyst to make that conversion from a very low heavy, low value residue into higher value products, diesel and loose base stocks. So there is broader application. Obviously, it depends on the nature of the molecules that you\u2019re trying to upgrade. But we feel \u2013 and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019ve challenged ourselves. For a long time we weren\u2019t investing in the downstream because \u2013 and I can say this with a lot of intimacy because I was involved it in at the time, we weren\u2019t going to put in kind of a bog standard industry technology and get industry returns. We were going to force ourselves to find technology that allowed us to get above industry returns. Rotterdam is a great example of that. I think Singapore will be another great example of that. And hopefully we\u2019ll be able to share some additional examples as we move forward and find additional applications. I\u2019m pretty optimistic. Jason Gammel : Look forward to that. My second question also relates to the LNG portfolio. Can you discuss whether you were interested in participating in the expansion at Qatar LNG? And if so, how would that rank relative to the three other LNG opportunities that you have in the portfolio currently? Darren Woods : Yes, we got a very long-term presence and partnership in Qatar. I think we value that. It\u2019s a good partnership. We\u2019ve had a lot of success working with QP. I would certainly look to continue to extend that. I think we\u2019re aligned to how we think about the business and the opportunity and value each other\u2019s partnership. So yes absolutely interested in continuing to partner with that and to develop resources and opportunities in Qatar. It is a very low cost supply gas, which as you\u2019ve heard me talk about is an important element and the LNG projects that we\u2019re advancing. With respect to how that would fit into our portfolio, I\u2019d come back to the discussion we\u2019ve had. We are looking at these opportunities not on the basis of what we have in our portfolio but on the basis of what industry has in its portfolio. And we\u2019re going to advance the opportunities that we think are advantage versus the rest of industry. If we can\u2019t find an investment that does that even if it looks good in our portfolio, we won\u2019t pursue it because frankly it\u2019s going to have to compete on an industry wide basis and that is the hurdle that we\u2019re using. We don\u2019t want to make decisions based on what we have. We want to make decisions based on how competitive it will be in the industry and that applies not only to LNG but every other thing that we\u2019re doing in this company from an investment standpoint. Jason Gammel : I appreciate your thoughts, Darren. Thank you. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll next go to Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Cheng : Hi, guys. Good morning. Darren Woods : Hi, Paul. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : First, I\u2019d just want to say thank you to Neil Hansen to put in the page identified the large earning item impacting on the quarter that \u2013 we really appreciate on that. For Darren, a couple of questions. First, with your reorganization you talk about how that it may accelerate your asset sales effort. How about on the other side of the ledger on the acquisitions side? Is that going to have any meaningful impact? And also if you can comment on what you believe today in the market if the bid-ask environment is still too wide apart or you actually think that there\u2019s a reasonable expectation on the environment at this point? Darren Woods : Okay. Thanks, Paul. I think it\u2019s hard to \u2013 what I would tell you is the reorganization is definitely going to improve the focus that we have on both sides; divestments and acquisitions. So I would expect to see additional thinking and focus on opportunities on both sides of the ledger there. Whether that results in anything or any acceleration on the acquisition side is really difficult to tell, because frankly it comes to your second question which is the bid-ask spread. For us to pursue an acquisition it has got to have to bring some unique value to our shareholders. We\u2019re not going to do a me too deal out there. And so I think what we have to look for is something that fits in the portfolio and allows us to leverage something unique to ExxonMobil which brings more value than on a standalone basis. And I think that\u2019s going to be the key driver. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s out there looking to discount their business. And so it\u2019s really got to find a way to bring some value there that doesn\u2019t exist otherwise. And I think those opportunities are there. It\u2019s just a function of finding them and seeing where the market goes and how willing sellers are and what their expectations are. So I\u2019d just say we\u2019re going to stay very focused on that and see what opportunities bring us. Paul Cheng : Second question that I think digitalization seems to be the best word amongst some of your peers and some people may even try to quantify that how big is the potential impact of the saving to the business. But Exxon, given your technology that we were actually a little bit surprised that you guys haven\u2019t really talked too much about that. And then when are you coming up with any quantification that how much it may mean to your business. Is that something that you can share on that? I\u2019m sure that you guys all have the expert looking at that. Darren Woods : Yes, you\u2019re right. We do. I think it is \u2013 some of our peers may have talked about a very high potential area, a lot of opportunity to bring additional value. We\u2019ve got an organization dedicated at looking at that. I think one of the advantages that we have, that organization is looking across the entire portfolio. There are a lot of synergies when it comes to digital across our manufacturing and production platforms, across our operations and chemicals, downstream and the upstream. And so we think given our size, given the fact that we participate all along the value chain, the data that we have probably is the best in industry. And then our ability to mine and leverage that data to improve operations I would say our capacity continues to grow. We\u2019re taking what I would say is a thoughtful methodical approach to it to make sure that we\u2019re building structures and data structures and digital tools to allow us to do that in a comprehensive way across the globe and to leverage that value. And so it\u2019s a very important area. I would not expect us to start putting numbers on that and sharing it. I think for us it\u2019s an advantage. It\u2019s going to be a competitive advantage. It\u2019s one we\u2019ll keep in-house. Paul Cheng : I see. All right, very good. Thank you. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Neil Hansen : I think we have time for one more question. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. Just one question for me. You\u2019ve alluded to the well-known regulatory issues at the Groningen field, but when we look at your total European gas volumes down 12% versus a year ago, even if we exclude Groningen there would be close to a double-digit decline. So what explains the continual declines in your North Sea gas outside of Groningen? Darren Woods : Well, we divested our Norway business last year and so that\u2019s going to have a material impact and that\u2019s probably what you\u2019re seeing there. And then on top of that, obviously gas demand and gas production is very seasonal depending on weather and temperatures and that\u2019s going to play into it as well. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Wasn\u2019t this kind of a cold winter though in Europe? Darren Woods : Not if you look \u2013 it\u2019s not if you look at compared to previous, no. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Thank you, guys. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Pavel. Neil Hansen : Great. Thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight our fourth quarter and full year that included strong earnings and cash flow performance supported by continued liquids growth and value capture from our integrated business model. We look forward to seeing everyone on March 6th at our Investor Day in New York. Again, we appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir. Neil Hansen : All right, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is Jack Williams. Jack is a Senior Vice President and Member of the Management Committee. His responsibility is for the projects, organization and the Downstream and Chemical business lines.  After I review the quarterly financial and operating performance, Jack will provide his perspectives on the quarter and give updates on the significant progress made in a number of key areas across the business that will generate accretive value for our shareholders. Following Jack\u2019s remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investor section of our website. I\u2019d also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation.  Moving to Slide 3, I\u2019ll now highlight our first quarter financial performance. Over the past few months, we made excellent progress on our growth projects with several key final investment decisions and continued exploration success. We also remain on track with plans to increase production in the Permian Basin to 1 million oil equivalent barrels per day by 2024. In fact, growth in the Permian during the quarter supported a 5% year-over-year increase in liquids volumes. The first quarter was also characterized by solid operating performance including the successful execution of scheduled maintenance across a number of our Downstream facilities.  Impressive progress in the first quarter was achieved in a margin environment that for both the Downstream and Chemical business lines was extremely challenging.  In addition, North American crude differentials narrowed significantly eliminating the large arbitrage opportunities that our logistics allowed us to capture in the fourth quarter. So, while the fundamentals and demand growth that underpin our investments remain strong. Near-term supply and demand imbalances pressured margins. In fact, in the Downstreams the lowest levels we\u2019ve seen in the last decade. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.55 including a negative $0.04 per share impact from asset impairments. All in all, the results were in line with our expectations given the margin environment we experienced during the quarter.  I\u2019ll now go through more detailed view of developments since the fourth quarter, starting first with the Upstream. Average crude oil prices were lower in the fourth quarter with Brent down $4.56 and WTI down $4.22. However, despite the decline in crude markers, ExxonMobil\u2019s liquids realizations increased by $2.32 driven by improved Western Canadian differentials.  Gas realizations on the other hand were down in the first quarter consistent with crude-linked LNG pricing lag and a $0.50 decline in Henry Hub pricing. Production in the Permian averaged 226,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 19% relative to the fourth quarter and more than double the average production we saw in the first quarter of last year.  Exploration success continued Offshore Guyana with three additional discoveries since the beginning of the year. In February, we announced discoveries at the Tilapia and Haimara wells and the Yellowtail well, which we announced last week marked our 13th discovery on the Stabroek Block. These discoveries add to the previously announced estimated recoverable resource of approximately 5.5 billion oil equivalent barrels.  We also discovered a major natural gas reservoir with the Glaucus well in Cyprus. Made the final investment decision to proceed with development of the Golden Pass LNG export project and made significant progress on another key project in our LNG portfolio which is signing of a gas agreement with the PNG government to support the Papua LNG expansion.  In the Downstream, industry refining margins weakened due primarily to excess gasoline supply. As I mentioned, North American differentials narrowed in the first quarter, increased takeaway capacity in the Permian, and production curtailments in Western Canada. From an operational standpoint, we successfully completed a heavy slate and scheduled maintenance impart to prepare for the upcoming IMO 2020 sulfur spec change. We announced final investment decisions for the Singapore resid upgrade projects, Fawley hydrofiner and the light crude expansion projects in Beaumont.  These advanced investments will increase our capacity to produce higher value products including ultra-low sulfur fuels and Group II Premium lubricant base stock.  Although fundamentals remains strong in the Chemical business, margins were challenged during the first quarter the supply lengths from recent industry capacity additions pressuring realizations. Supported by continued demand growth, our volumes in the Chemical business increased our 100,000 tons.  We also progressed a polyethylene expansion at Beaumont, which is on track to start up in the third quarter and we funded three major Olefin derivative projects from U.S. Gulf Coast.  Moving to Slide 5 for an overview of Upstream volumes. Production in the first quarter of 2019 was $4 million oil equivalent barrels per day, in line with the production in the fourth quarter of last year. Again production in the Permian increased by 36,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 19% increase bringing total production in the Permian to 226,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the first quarter.  This impressive growth is more than offset by lower Kearl output and natural field declines. Looking at first quarter production relative to the same periods last year shown on the bottom-left chart, liquids volumes increased 5%, growth of a 126,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian drove volumes higher. The absence of the PNG earthquake and lower maintenance in Canada and Qatar also contributed to an increase in volumes.  Normal weather in Europe led to lower seasonal gas demand, but again, overall volumes were higher by more than 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter of the last year. Moving to Slide 6, and a review of first quarter results compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. First quarter earnings of $2.4 billion were down $3.7 billion. Upstream earnings were down approximately $400 million driven by the impact of fewer sales days in the quarter, higher maintenance and downtime notably at Golden and the absence of various one-time items that impacted our fourth quarter results.  Downstream earnings decreased by $3 billion with several factors contributing to the lower results. Narrowed North American differentials, lower industry margins, the absence of fourth quarter asset sales in Germany and Italy, and derivative impacts. And I\u2019ll provide more details on these drivers on the upcoming slides.  Finally, Chemical earnings were lower by $200 million, primarily driven by the absence of the favorable non-U.S. tax items in the fourth quarter and Chemical margins remained under pressure with recent industry capacity additions.  Turning to Slide 7, I\u2019ll expand on the business drivers that impacted our Downstream\u2019s results, again relative to the fourth quarter. Downstream results for the first quarter were a loss of $256 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by the absence of the Germany retail, and Augusta refinery asset sales and unfavorable margin impacts of approximately $2 billion. These unfavorable margin impacts are in line with the drivers that we\u2019ve previously communicated. The largest impact due to narrowing crude differentials again mainly in Western Canada that resulted in about half of the unfavorable margin impacts.  In addition, industry refining margins were lower driven by excess gasoline supply and a tightened clean-dirty product spread.  Finally, the absence of favorable mark-to-market derivative impacts in the fourth quarter which were the result of a declining oil price environment, combined with the unfavorable impacts in the first quarter has resulted in rising oil price environment resulted in a negative book margin impact of more than $600 million quarter-on-quarter.  On Slide 8, I will provide a more detailed view of the current margin environment in the Downstream. The chart on the left of the page plot industry refining margins over time and clearly shows that the industry is inherently volatile.  In the first quarter, industry refining margins were among the lowest we\u2019ve seen in the last ten years. Low conversion margins were relatively strong supported by fuel oil and distillate. However, high conversion margins were challenged. Weak gasoline, naphtha and LPG crack spreads. High refinery utilization drove oversupply of these products.  Slide 9 provides some additional perspectives on the current Chemical margin environment. Again the chart on the upper left there shows the amount of polyethylene capacity added by years since 2009 compared to the annual growth in demand over that same period.  Chemical demand remains strong and is expected to grow at approximately 3% per year, a 1.2 times global GDP. However, recent capacity additions have outpaced demand, depressing global PE margins as shown on the bottom-left chart. On the U.S. Gulf Coast alone, the industry has added nearly 5 million tons of capacity since 2017 in great part to capture the advantage of low-cost ethane feedstock.  As a result, polyethylene margins have declined by approximately 45% since 2015 reflecting the cyclical nature of the Chemical business.  Moving to Slide 10, which provides a review of our cash profile for the first quarter. First quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital yielded $8.3 billion in cash flows from operating activities. We experienced a $13 billion working capital release during the quarter. This was mostly offset \u2013 I am sorry \u2013 mostly due to higher seasonal payables balances which are primarily tax-related and an inventory release in the Downstream. This occurred as we do product inventories built higher to planned maintenance turnaround.  Other non-cash items had a negative impact of approximately $1 billion, which most notably included the reinvestment of equity company earnings as part of the Tengiz expansion projects. First quarter additions to PP&E were $5.9 billion driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian Basin. Total capital expenditures were $6.9 billion, in line with the 2019 CapEx guidance that we provided at the Investor Day in March. Earlier this week, the Board of Directors declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.87 per share, representing a 6% increase from last quarter and marking our 37th consecutive year of per share dividend growth.  Gross debt increased by approximately $3 billion in the quarter and cash ended the quarter at $4.6 billion.  Now, before I turn it over to Jack, let me provide a few observations regarding the second quarter. In the Upstream, we expect lower gas volumes driven by seasonal demand and I\u2019ll provide a little more detail on this on the next slide. In the Downstream, we expect industry refining margins to recover with higher seasonal gasoline demand and heavier industry maintenance, which is common this time of the year.  North American crude differentials however are anticipated to remain near first quarter of 2019 levels. Scheduled maintenance in the second quarter in the Downstream will be similar to what we\u2019ve experienced in the first quarter. Chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure as the market continues to work through supply lengths from recent capacity additions.  And like the Downstream, scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the second quarter will be significant. And I\u2019ll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance in a few slides. But first, let me provide some more detail on seasonal gas demand on Slide 12.  The chart on the left there shows the negative impacts we typically experienced from lower gas demand in Europe in the second quarter. And as you know, gas demand is highly seasonal and driven by weather. Second quarter gas demand is on average 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day lower than the first quarter of the year and we expect a similar trend to occur this year. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some perspectives on our second quarter outlook for Downstream and Chemical\u2019s scheduled maintenance. As we previously communicated, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream in 2019 will be higher than normal and again partly in preparation for IMO 2020.  We expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the second quarter to be broadly in line with what we experienced in the first quarter.  The estimated earnings impacts for the second quarter for the Downstream is shown on the upper-left chart. In the Chemical business, again shown on the bottom-left chart, and as I indicated, we expect to see significant scheduled maintenance with the impact in the second quarter similar to the amount we saw in the entire second half of 2018. Hopefully that provides you with some helpful perspectives on key drivers of our expected performance for the upcoming second quarter. At this time, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Jack. Jack Williams : Okay, thank you, Neil. Well, as Neil covered, it was a tough market environment for us this quarter. Overall though, we are pleased with the underlying operating performance of the businesses and of course wish that margin environment would have supported the translation of that into higher earnings. But as you saw in the Downstream margin plot that Neil showed, the margins were at historically low levels and our results were in line with that margins earned. The plot also demonstrated the historical volatility of Downstream margins and the wide swing that happen over a pretty short period of time, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t try to predict or forecast margins.  Instead, we work to build our businesses to be robust to the swings and while we test new investments across a broad range of prices.  Investments we are currently pursuing across all three sectors stand up to that testing and our advantage versus industry. So that\u2019s going to help us manage through this volatility and it\u2019s going to deliver value in markets that remains fundamentally strong. Our activities to execute those new investments remain on track and some significant progress so far this year that Neil has mentioned, I\u2019ll just reiterate, the Upstream we doubled Permian production volumes in the first quarter of last year and made three new discoveries in Guyana. I feel really good about the strong portfolio of Upstream investments that we have today which are at the top tier of industry.  And as you know, a strong opportunity pipeline is critical given the depletion nature of the Upstream business. In the Downstream, we FID three major refining projects and the other three of the six projects that I have been talking about are now online. These investments improved the yield profile as strategically important sites delivering higher value products that are growing in demand. In the Chemicals, we also funded three projects, three major U.S. Gulf Coast olefin derivative projects and are making good progress with the Corpus steam cracker which we expect to FID around mid-year of this year and when we do that, that will be our 12th FID of the 13 investments that underpin the Chemical\u2019s growth plan and allow us to maintain a strong position in our performance product markets. And finally, we are continuing to see value from our integrated business model and we are really pleased that our new Upstream and projects organizations are now up and running.  So, with that, let me provide a few activity highlights starting with the Permian. As you can see on the left-hand graph, we are continuing to track our production outlook. This volumes ramp is supported by strong well inventory. In fact, by the time we reach 1 million barrels a day production level in the Permian, we will have only drilled about half of our current well inventory.  We are running 46 rigs there and we\u2019ll be ramping up through the year. And this level of rig activity allows us to develop multiple horizons and either full or half sections concurrently which reduces the risk apparent well performance issues as wells with possible communications will be fracked before any are produced. The development with this method requires blocky acreage and a large rig fleet and a long-term commitment to deal with lumpier production profiles and we have all three. In addition to this drilling activity, we are building out our unique infrastructure in the Delaware with the first stage facility that\u2019s a central delivery point in our Southeast and Mexico acreage being ready by year end. So, good progress in the Permian and also in Guyana.  Last week, we announced a new discovery in the Yellowtail-1 well which as Neil said it was our 13th discovery on the Stabroek Block. And you can see in the map on the left that this discovery is in the Turbot area which is going to be a large development of similar to Liza.  This well along with Haimara and Tilapia discoveries are going to add to the 5.5 billion oil equivalent barrels recoverable resource estimate that we announced earlier this year at our Investor Day. And our drilling continues. Development drilling at 17 wells for producing the first phase of Liza is progressing well and should be completed in the third quarter. The other rigs will continue drilling exploration in appraisal wells including further drilling on the Hammerhead and Ranger discoveries.  The construction of the Liza Destiny FPSO vessel for phase one is being completed in Singapore with planned sail-away this summer and should be in Guyanese waters in the third quarter. The larger Liza Phase 2 development designed to produced 220,000 barrels a day is in the permitting phase and is planned for a 2022 start-up. So, lots of activity, exciting new discovery, really good development progress in Guyana.  Let me switch gears and talk about few Downstream project updates. Starting in Singapore, I\u2019ve spoken about the Singapore resid project before and is now been FID. This project is upgrading resid to higher quality distillates and Group II lube base stocks which will be unique in industry. No one has ever upgraded heavy fuel oil streams into Group II lube base stocks. This project is taking a notional $60 per barrel product and upgrading into a $140 per barrel product. It\u2019s an industry first and it\u2019s made possible through proprietary process and catalyst technology. It\u2019s the largest of the six major refining projects that we have and due to its technology advantage, it is expected to generate a high-teens return.  And this project is really a great example of several competitive advantages that we spoke about last March or at the back in March. It\u2019s made possible by a new unique technology. We filed for 35 patents related to the catalyst and novel processes that will be used and it\u2019s a very large project. It\u2019s upgrading 90,000 barrels a day of fuel oil, which really moves the needle on site profitability.  So clearly, this project is leveraging our scale. And it\u2019s a terrific example of integration. And Singapore \u2013 Singapore is our largest integrated site globally and with this project, we are upgrading both refinery and chemical resid streams with two different but complementary technology solutions. In fact, I mentioned this is a downstream project. But you ought to think about this as an integrated downstream and Chemical project. It significantly improves the competitive to the Singapore refinery and reduces the supply cost of our crude cracker below any other liquids cracker in Asia. So that\u2019s planned for 2023. So now let me talk about a project we haven\u2019t talked much about and that\u2019s Fawley. Our project at Fawley is the last of the six key refining projects that are introduced to you back in 2018 and it\u2019s also now fully funded.  This project is more straightforward than Singapore. It leverages advantage logistics and like our Rotterdam and Antwerp projects, it\u2019s tightly integrated with the Northwest Europe Refining and Chemical circuit.  It improves our refining profitability in two important ways. First, it upgrades the product slate to better match the UK market. The more ultra low sulfur diesel, more jet fuel, more lower sulfur mogas which reduces both imports and exports in the site.  And second, the project expands Fawley\u2019s logistics into the heart of the UK market allowing for increased product flow into our West London Terminal, which services nearby Heathrow Airport. With the combination of these two aspects will make Fawley the most efficient and most competitive fuel supply into the Greater London market. And this combination also translates into an expected project return in the high-teens.  So, again, switching gears beyond projects, another activity we\u2019ve been focused on is the optimization of our entire value chain, both in lubricants and in fuels. We continue to get some questions on our trading activities.  So, I thought I\u2019d add some context \u2013 since it was a reconciling earnings factor this quarter. On the left is a summary of our global footprint from equity production to refining capacity to logistics, to our branded retail sites.  Our assets stay in the globe and the entire value chain. Our objective is to ensure our shareholders capture the full value of that chain from the reservoir to the gas tank, and of our footprint from U.S. to Europe to Asia. Then no matter where the value is realized along the chain or around the world. So we are using asset-backed trading to best achieve that objective without speculating.  For example, posing low gas arms from Europe to the Americas or providing storage of our products \u2013 for products when logistics temporarily tighten. We are basically improving the utilization of our global assets and generating solid value from these activities. Although sometimes it\u2019s difficult to see quarter-on-quarter, due to changing mark-to-market impact from our open derivative positions which was certainly the case this quarter.  So to wrap up, we are continuing to leverage our competitive advantages of scale, technology, integration, functional excellence and of course, our high quality workforce to grow shareholder value. We have made good progress towards our growth plan so far this year with further exploration success and project FIDs.  We remain focused on continuously improving our base business while making investments across the value chain to grow earnings and cash flow across a broad range of price and margin environments. And finally, as evidenced by the additional exploration success in Guyana, we continue to be reminded that there is still a good bit of upside with this exciting growth plan that our company is on. So with that, let me hand it back to Neil to kick-off our Q&A session. Neil Hansen : Right. Thank you for your comments, Jack. We will now be more than happy to take any questions you have. Operator : Thank you Mr. Williams and Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] We will first go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning guys. How are you doing? Neil Hansen : Good morning. Jack Williams : Great, Sam. Good morning. Sam Margolin : So, my first question is about the Permian. Your program there is complex in a lot of ways, but one specific element of it is that if you look at the capital that you are spending there today, there is sort of a split between what\u2019s kind of pre-productive in facilities and delineation and what\u2019s part of the development program.  Can you just broadly tell us where you are at right now in that mix? And maybe, how that\u2019s going to evolve until your 2021 inflection when the pipeline comes on and it looks like you sort of go hyperbolic on the production side? Jack Williams : Yes, thanks, Sam. Look, it\u2019s a good question and I will \u2013 I appreciate you acknowledging all the things we are doing in the Permian right now. We talk a lot about the rig counts. That\u2019s kind of the headline number how many rigs are you running which is important and it\u2019s obviously directly resulting in the volumes growth that we talked about.  But we are also doing a lot more. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve been working very hard to delineate this new acreage we have in this basin which we\u2019ve made some good progress on. And lining up this big kind of differentiated project that we are looking to do there and that infrastructure that I talked that we are setting up.  That central delivery point and one of the units in our new development will be designed for 100,000 barrels of crude and 200 million cubic feet of gas and it\u2019s set up to keep expanding that as our production grows. So we\u2019ve seen a good bit of time spending a lot of time and energy and resources on setting ourselves up for long-term success in the Permian and not just the near-term volumes growth.  It\u2019s hard for me to give you a percentage break between those two activities. But I will tell you that the infrastructure piece of it is pretty material. Sam Margolin : Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then, somebody is going to ask this, so am as well, be me. Just on your position there today, it looks like there is going to be some consolidation at least chatter around for a while.  Just to clarify all your forecast that you put up publicly that\u2019s based on what you\u2019ve got in the portfolio today, there is not necessarily any additional A&D activity that\u2019s baked into that. Is that correct? And it\u2019s hard for you. What do you see in the landscape of maybe private and public that\u2019s available to you right now? Jack Williams : Yes, thanks, Sam. Yes, you are probably right. Somebody is going to ask that question. Look, I mean, clearly, that\u2019s why I wanted to mention the well inventories in my remarks. What we have today is clearly only dependent on what we have in our resource estimate and well inventory today. It\u2019s not depending on any additional acquisitions, not depending on any technology improvements, any continued efficiency improvements in our well designs.  All of which I think will happen, but it\u2019s not baked into any outlooks we have right now. In terms of \u2013 I think let me just step back and look at the whole M&A environment and just make the comment that I think it\u2019s a reminder of the statement I made about the upstream being a depletion business. You have to have a good pipeline of investment opportunities to continue to replenish as you deplete those resources and that was very much on our mind back in 2015 and 2016. We are very active in the bottom of the cycle to bring on this nice set of new opportunities we have that we are currently executing today. Some of those were acquisitions. It was partly organic, partly small company acquisitions, but all picked up at the bottom of the market and they made good sense back in that kind of \u2013 I\u2019ll call it, $40 to $50 environment that you can imagine in kind of $60, $70 environment that looked that much better.  So very happy with what we take up and it gives us the luxury to sit here today and to not need to do any further M&A activity. Not to say we won\u2019t but we don\u2019t need to. So, for instance, I would be surprised if over time, we did not take up the more Permian acreage. But I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s going to be small bolt-on acquisitions that we pick up over time.  I don\u2019t know what the timing in which that\u2019s going to happen or whether it\u2019s something more significant. But we don\u2019t need to. We don\u2019t need to, so we have the luxury of being able to look over the horizon and make sure that whatever we look hard at, is bringing significant value and makes really good sense and it\u2019s very compelling for the corporation. Sam Margolin : Thanks so much. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Sam. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes, good morning. I guess, maybe we could take a look at Guyana, three discoveries year-to-date, I mean, if you did want a year, it would be a pretty good track record. This was definitely a focus of the Analyst Day and you\u2019ve continued to have discoveries. You mentioned the resources above 5.5 billion barrels most likely with these additional discoveries.  Jack, when do you think Exxon considers maybe more than just what\u2019s been laid out? Maybe what\u2019s the timing for when you are thinking about that internally, maybe when that gets addressed at the public level? And then, what that can mean in terms of additional developments beyond the five FPSOs that have been discussed? Jack Williams : Well, thanks for the question, and yes, I mean, Guyana, it's a really exciting time for us there right now, a lot of activity and we are incorporating to the extent we can, we are incorporating that data real-time as we get more developments in, more discoveries, but as we get these discoveries, we naturally want to drill some delineation wells, get some more data, core - get some dynamic well test data.  So we are incorporating and by the way, on all of these development wells, we are drilling for Liza-1, these 17 wells, every single time we are penetrating reservoir, we are getting more opportunities to the tune up our seismic data and improve our sub-service understanding. So we are learning significant amounts kind of day-by-day in Guyana. I think I would just say that, again, the 5.5 billion oil equivalent barrels recoverable resource estimate did not include these last three discoveries. So I would say, it's safe to say there is a good bit of upside to that number.  I can't really give you anything further right now in terms of quantifying that, but we are continuing to look at that development plan and looking what would be the best way to continue to incorporate this additional encouraging results that we are getting. Roger Read : Okay. And along those lines, I guess, maybe the seismic shoot that's currently, I can't remember it's currently under way or it's about to be underway, but I guess you'd want to get all that information and then that analysis done before you'd really kind of make any major change, I would guess? Jack Williams : Yes, I think, again, clearly, as I said, our sub-service understanding is really growing and that's going to further add to it. So, the more we can get as we are planning these new developments, the better, the more efficient we can plan them. So, yes, that's another piece of data that's going to be important. Roger Read : And then if I could pivot real quick to the Chemicals business, the chart on the capacity additions in the margin is definitely very helpful. I mean, Jack, you've got a lot of experience in that in the Downstream Chemicals area.  What would be kind of the typical workout process here as you think about what's coming on globally and the demand expectations, the 3.3% a year? Need help for when we kind of get back to maybe a more, call it, normalized margin environment or at least one we are not facing headwinds in terms of the direction of margins? Jack Williams : Well, the demand growth is, call it, 4 MTA \u2013 3 MTA to 4 MTA a year global demand growth and we brought on 5 MTA to 6 MTA. So it's going to take \u2013 it's not months, not months. But it's not a - more than a handful of years either. So I am thinking, things \u2013 I would think certainly depending on what more comes on in 2020, we start \u2013 not start seeing relief then.  But the rest of 2019 might be pretty tough, but we are not going to, not trying to predict where margins going to go, there is all kinds of other factors that come into play but - and there is good reason. We understand why the oversupply happened. This ethane advantage in the U.S. is very real. But, as you think about our investments going forward, I'll take for instance the Corpus cracker that I referenced.  We are testing that over the whole resiliency of \u2013 we are testing the resiliency out of the whole range of the cycle and in that particular project, we have tested that the current environment we see today is within the band of what we are testing on that project and remains robust.  So all we can do is continue to make the best investments in the industry, which we are doing and I think that'll be worked off in a relatively short time, but I don't think it's going to be in the coming couple of months. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Jack, Neil, thanks for taking the question. The first is just on the asset sale program. You guys introduced a relatively robust asset sale target earlier this year. Can you give us an update on the program? And just frame for us again how we should think about that target? Is it really a P50 type of target? Or did you bake in a level of conservatism given the uncertainty around the macro? Jack Williams : Yes, thanks for the question. It's an important topic for us these days. Naturally, as I mentioned, with bringing in all of these attractive assets and investment opportunities, it's a really good opportunity to go back and look at the portfolio kind of prune the tail a bit, if you will.  And so, we work just \u2013 we looked at the whole portfolio and had this plan that we laid out and you can imagine that as we give you all our number that we haven't done before, we feel fairly confident in it. So, it\u2019s \u2013 there is some risking in there. We could overshoot that a bit.  But we feel like that's a good number. I'll call it P50, maybe a tad more conservative than P50. But I'll call it that as we go forward, and we are making good progress. And then we have lots of activity in the market right now. And I would expect to see some significant divestments this calendar year as we move toward this three year plan. Neil Mehta : And could you remind us, Jack, what the regions are? I know you called out Gulf of Mexico, that's on the market right now. Jack Williams : No, it's global, I'll just tell you that. I mean, it's not just a U.S. focused divestment plan. It kind of spans the \u2013 it spans all regions. So, it's pretty broad. I don't have the specific breakout on regions, but it's broad. Neil Mehta : Fair enough. Thank you. And then the follow-up is on, going back to your comments on the M&A market, can you just give us the framework again for the way you think about acquiring incremental assets, whether acquiring companies, what's Exxon looking for here?  And the context is that the bid \u2013 I want to get some perspective on one, the bid-ask and two, the relative valuation multiple of Exxon based on consensus cash flow numbers relative to potential acquisition targets has increased over the course of the last six months. And so, from an accretion perspective, it does seem more compelling at least on in a spreadsheet.  But I just want a little bit more color on the framework and just thoughts on the opportunity set to build on your prior comments. Jack Williams : Yes, okay. Good. Thanks. Let me provide a little more on how we are thinking about M&A. In terms of what we are looking for, clearly we want to \u2013 if you think about what we've brought in recently with our acquisition in Papua New Guinea, acquisition and Mozambique, acquisition in the Permian, these are all assets where we can add significant value.  They are going to leverage our competitive strengths, allow us to bring a lot of value to that asset and a lot more value than what we \u2013 than the acquisition costs. So, we are not really interested in buying well-developed assets that are more or less buying cash flow. We are interested in buying something where we can bring our competitive strengths and to bear on uplifting the value of that asset.  And I think, that's been very clear in terms of what we brought into portfolio in that method. And so, one thing to think about that we also think about especially these days is that, we have a full plate of opportunities right now. So, one thing we are doing is, we just talked about the investments we are kind of making, we are moving stuff off the plate to make sure we have plenty of room to continue to develop these great assets that we have. But clearly, as we think about incremental opportunities, we are thinking about substitution. We are not thinking about additive, because we are \u2013 the organization has plenty to work on right now and we are cognizant of that fact and that ultimately be the limiting factor in terms of what we are trying to do. So, we kind of factor all that in.  But one thing I can tell you for sure is that any acquisition opportunity we look at would be something we think we can bring a lot of additional value to. Neil Mehta : Appreciated, Jack. Thanks, Neil. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Neil. Jack Williams : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just following up on Neil's question, on the future projects and new additions to the portfolio, are you basically saying that the project\u2019s organizational capacity is in limit at the moment, because obviously the balance sheet is very strong you could do more if you wanted to.  But there is probably a level of efficiency with how many major projects you want to do at the same time? That will be my first question. And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up to that. Jack Williams : Yes. What I would tell you is it's a big consideration. I am not saying we necessarily at our limit, but I am saying it's a big consideration, because it's key to capital efficiency. The industry is littered with projects that look really good at FID and were not executed well. And ended up not providing the value that they should have.  We are committed to making sure that what we take on we can execute well and as we bring something else in the portfolio, we are going to make that test. We are going to test to make sure that we can \u2013 whatever we bring in, we can execute it well. And so, the ones we funded, we are going to get the value out of our shareholders.  So, I wouldn't tell you necessarily we are at some limit, but we are looking at it closely. And it's a strong consideration as we bring new opportunities on. Operator : Okay. Moving on, we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Excuse me. Thank you. You took me by surprise there. Good morning everybody. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Doug. Jack Williams : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : Guys, I guess, this is an opening comment. I guess, a lot of people maybe didn't pay enough attention to your 8-K in terms of the numbers that you tried to walk back early in April and my suggestion to you is, perhaps a press release around that detail might be a better way of getting that out there, because it seems to me that there were still a lot of steel numbers in your earnings. Just an opening comment if you can indulge me. My two questions \u2013 yes, go ahead. Jack Williams : Can I go ahead now at your opening comment, because I think you are right. I mean, we certainly \u2013 we endeavor it in a fairly concerted effort to provide appropriate perspectives on what we were seeing in the quarter and I think during the call in the fourth quarter, we kind of listed out some of those factors and then, as you mentioned, we also provided additional couple of 8-Ks during the quarter to help people understand, especially in the Downstream and Chemical business, some of the challenges we were facing.  And again, from our perspective, there were no surprises in the results. I think the results that we are communicating today are exactly in line with what we provided in those 8-Ks. And again, during the quarter, in the fourth quarter. So we appreciate that, and maybe we are continuing to look at ways to improve providing that transparency making sure that we provide the context to the market. Doug Leggate : Yes, terrific effort on that point. No question. The disclosure has gotten a lot better, for what is worth you have my number. So we are quite happy. Anyway, I got two questions if I may. My first one, Jack, disposals were very light on this quarter.  I just wonder, if you could speak to, why that might be your expectation if that was timing-related and your confidence level as if whether you still expect to hit the kind of runrate laid out in March? And then my follow-up, I'll wait till you answer that my follow-up is on the Guyana, please. Thank you. Jack Williams : Yes. Sure, Doug. Yes, you're right, very light in this quarter, fully expected by us, the timeframe on these. Generally, we are starting a year ahead of time in terms of getting these things in the market when the being able to get something to the point where we can announce it. So, fully expected and does not alter my confidence one bit in terms of our target going forward. Lot of activity right now and like I said, I'd expect more this year. Doug Leggate : Thanks. We will look forward to that. My follow-up is kind of a part A and a part B, if you've been named on Guyana, as we just come back from Singapore, I visited the Liza Destiny and I guess, sort of a couple of points around this.  SPM are telling us a number of - what I think are incremental data points for us, at least. First of all, they expect to sail mid-June which would put you in Guyana run by early August. So I am just wondering \u2013 or mid-August, what that means for the timing of phase 1? That's my first question. Second question is they are also telling as you've confirmed to them Payara will be 220,000 barrels a day. So, wonder if you can speak to that? And then finally, two appraisal wells in Hammerhead, both your exploration assets dedicated to \u2013 on appraisal. That seems to me, you wouldn't do that unless you were planning a fast track FID, which obviously got implications for your volume targets. So, I wonder if you could speak to that and I'll leave it there. Thank you. Jack Williams : Okay. Thanks. Thank you, Doug. On the FASO, the Liza Destiny, look, what you mentioned was consistent with what I said earlier in terms of a summer sail-away in the third quarter being in Guyanese waters. We set our start-up as was early first quarter of 2020 and we always are trying to do better.  So if we can get that thing online before then, we will. And I would just say the project is going very well, very well. We are pleased in both the FPSO construction activity and also the drilling activity going on in the country. So everything is just a bright green light on that and we'll see where we end up in terms of actual start-up. On Payara, again, I would just say that that the number you threw out wasn't within the range we've been talking about. I really don't have any update today in terms of where that's specifically going to be. But that's not really inconsistent with what we've been talking about, just to kind of on the high-end. And then on Hammerhead, look, I would just say, Doug, it's still early days, we are still doing a lot of delineation drilling. We are still a lot to learn. In Guyana, we have multiple play types. We have multiple parts to the stratigraphic section. It's a huge block. We are continuing to learn. I wouldn't draw too much into where we are going in terms of delineation activities. We are still just trying to gather a lot of data. I would just tell you that, in general, the vector is very positive. But I wouldn't get more specific than that. Doug Leggate : Well, I appreciate you taking part A, B and C. Thanks a lot, Jack. Thanks, Neil. Jack Williams : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hi. Good morning. I guess, just a follow-up on Doug's original comments. Maybe some clarifications to help us, perhaps trying to avoid something in the second quarter. Two parts to it. One is, the derivatives impact that you are talking about quarter-over-quarter of $600 million.  If we go back to a more neutral, flattish price environment, your comments obviously are clear they are not adding back a full $600 million. But I am just trying to understand order of magnitude, how to think about that.  And then, secondarily, on the cash flow side, you talked about the affiliates elements there, some of which was Tengiz. I believe, which according to Chevron's slides are expected to continue. But also I remember last year's first quarter that there were some seasonal elements to this where it was a big headwind in the first quarter last year as well. So, if you could clarify both of those items moving forward, that will be helpful. Neil Hansen : Sure. Phil, I can take that. So on the derivatives, so the impact we saw in the first quarter. We talked about the mark-to-market. It was a combination of a gain that we saw on the unsettled positions we had during the fourth quarter in a price environment that was declining. Again that was roughly $300 million, $400 million on the mark-to-market.  And then, when you look at the first quarter, again, we had a derivative activity on the unsettled positions there with rising oil prices, we saw a negative or an unfavorable mark-to-market on those positions. And so, it's really, when you look at a relative comparison, that's where we see the $600 million impact on the earnings.  Going forward, it's not an easy thing to predict. It obviously depends on what happens in the price environment. I can tell you that, again, generally what will happen is if oil prices rise, we are likely to see unfavorable impacts on those mark-to-market positions. And then, if prices decline, we are likely to see a gain.  I think, if you looked at the quarterly, the absolute quarterly effects last year, it was a couple hundred million dollars per quarter. Again, sometimes it was negative, sometimes it was positive. But hopefully that gives you some indication of the level of activity. And as Jack mentioned, we are increasing the amount of asset-backed trading that we are doing.  So that might increase the impact you see in a quarter. But again, we are not taking speculative positions. This is based on our assets. And so you are not likely to see a significant increase. But again, hopefully that gives you some perspective, Phil, on what to expect going forward. On your second question on the cash, so, in the first quarter we did see, I think, we mentioned, there is always going to be some timing on the equity companies, difference between when earnings occur and when we get those dividends. There is always going to be an impact on that. And in the first quarter, we do typically see a bit higher increase in that area.  When it comes to the timing when that comes back, if you look at the biggest impact there is on Tengiz, our equity investment in Tengiz. And so, as you know, they're undertaking a significant expansion. And so a lot of those earnings are being reinvested back into that expansion. We are still getting some dividends from them.  But a lot of that is going to be delayed until they have completed that expansion. And in the first quarter, that was roughly about $400 million, that timing difference between earnings and dividends. But for the rest of it, again, we see a little bit of a headwind in the first quarter. That's likely to work itself off during the year. The one specific item where it might be longer than that is the TCO investment in Tengiz. Phil Gresh : And just to clarify, the Tengiz part of that, is that included in the co-land or is that separate? Neil Hansen : I think the co-land is separate. This is just an effect of them taking the earnings and then reinvesting them back into that expansion. Phil Gresh : Got it. Okay. Last question would just be for Jack. On the Downstream side of things, maybe you could just give us your latest thoughts here. Obviously, the first quarter is challenging. The cracks element is getting better as we progress through the year.  But where would you put yourself about how optimistic you are around IMO 2020? The impact we could see from that. And when we might see it? Valero was saying that maybe September, October you start to see some impacts on crack spreads from it. But curious how you think about things in light of all the diesel upgrading investments you've been making. Jack Williams : Yes. Thanks. The - in terms of the overall margins, you saw the vector of the graph that we showed, that Neil showed, going up quite a bit in March and further up a bit in April. So, I would say things are restoring to, what I would call, more typical levels in terms of overall industry refining margins. So don't know how much further I can really project that out.  But in terms of margin we are seeing right now, certainly, clearly different than the average of the first quarter. And in terms of the IMO, I think that the timeframe you talked about is a pretty good estimate, that's kind of what my guys were telling me too, that kind of late third quarter, early fourth quarter is when the market is going to be adjusting to that January 1st spec change. So, we ought to start seeing something in that sort of timeframe. All I can tell you is that, the market fundamentals would say that the clean/dirty spread needs to expand and grow. Don't know how much that's going to grow. Don't know how long it's going to stay there. Obviously, one of the things that was interesting in the first quarter, it actually contracted.  The clean/dirty spread actually contracted, because of all the conversion capacity that's been added just kind of destroying demand for fuel oil, so. Hard to predict. The fundamentals would say. Yes, but it clearly needs to go out and of course that's going to help all the high conversion refineries, which we have many. So, I am kind of \u2013 we are looking forward to that time period. But it's really, really hard to tell the exact numbers on how big that's going to get and like I said, how long it's going to last. Phil Gresh : Thanks for the comment. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Phil. Jack Williams : Thanks, Phil. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you. Hi, Jack. I just wanted to return to the Downstream. And to echo the comments, appreciate the pre-close guidance and the detail on it and granularity. But it does strike me it's the sort of second-quarter in a rolling year where the Downstream in total has had a difficult quarter. It shares some of those with peers.  But it does look to me that ExxonMobil has become quite volatile in the way it delivers its Downstream earnings both refining market and Chemicals. And that's somewhat different to what we've experienced historically. So, I just wanted to sort of explore that a little bit more and ask you, is that just a function of some idiosyncratic characteristics of the market right now?  Is that to do with some changes that are going on at ExxonMobil itself? Or is it just that it's to do largely with the preparation ahead of IMO in the sort of the downtime that you are having to experience? It just looks that a lot of kilter would what we've seen over many years. Thanks. Jack Williams : Yes, Jon. First of all, fourth quarter was actually very strong for the Downstream. Jon Rigby : Yes. Jack Williams : The market environment was better, but not a lot better, but what was different was we had those differentials in North America. And they helped us in the fourth quarter and of course that's not just \u2013 it's not just something that just came out of thin air. We made investments in the Midstream to be able to where we are seeing across the value chain.  In some quarters, that's going to help us a lot more than other quarters. So in other words, where there is market disconnect, we are going to be in an advantage position. So, fourth quarter and first quarter was a big difference. As Neil said, some of that was mark-to-market impacts, which that maybe something that may be a little different than what we saw historically.  The Midstream exposure, we feel really good about that we think it's adding a lot of value for our shareholders. That might provide a little more fluctuations. But other than that, I don't see it and I feel very strongly that both of those activities are adding material value over the mid-term and long-term. So feel really good about what we are doing there. Jon Rigby : Right. And just\u2026 Jack Williams : In terms of -- again, in terms of IMO, we have very high conversion, we are adding to that conversions. Everything we are doing on these refining projects is adding advantaged products, products that are growing in demand and feel really good. We are making our refineries more competitive as we go forward. All of them are moving to lower cost to supply, more competitive in the global refining spectrum. Jon Rigby : Right. So, would it be fair to say that the sort of measures that you're talking about extending your participation along the entire value chain at the same time just a lot of happened at the same time as some of the macro conditions have worked against you to show what the benefits of those initiatives are. Is that the way of thinking about it right now? Jack Williams : Actually, Jon, I really wouldn't look at it that way, because I think we've benefited - net benefited. If you call that macro, it\u2019s only one particular quarter, Okay, maybe I would agree. If you look at it over just take a year, we've got \u2013 we've had net benefit from looking across the value chain. Clearly net benefit and our asset-backed trading activities clearly have benefits. So, I think the macro factors have played out pretty much as we expected and we are benefiting from what we are doing. You just got to expand your horizon beyond one quarter. Jon Rigby : Right, okay. Thanks. Operator : Okay. We'll next move to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much and good morning, gentlemen. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Jason. Jack Williams : My first question \u2013 the first question I had was on some comments that you had made earlier, Jack, about essentially project capabilities. You obviously sanctioned Golden Pass during the first quarter. You made some pretty significant strides on PNG, LNG or at PNG as it relates to the Elk-Antelope fields during the quarter and also have made progress on Mozambique.  You are essentially the operator for all three of these on the Downstream. Do you think the organization would have the capabilities by proceeding with all three at the same time? Jack Williams : Yes. Yes, I do think we have those capabilities and that\u2019s - we've actually modeled it all out and we definitely have the capability to do that. And I would tell you one thing also that's helping us in that regard is our new projects organization. Combining all our project resources into one functional company, that's really going to allow us to capture a lot of synergies across executing those projects.  You mentioned all those were upstream projects, but we have some big projects in Downstream and Chemicals as well. So it's one company. We are able to look across the entire project spectrum and make sure we are deploying the right resources on the right projects and they have looked at all of that activity and we feel confident in our ability to execute it. My point I was making earlier was, as we bring new things on, we are going to continue to reassess that. As we bring in new opportunities, which I fully expect we will, we are going to continue to test that statement. And it is a consideration as we continue to look at bringing new things in. Jason Gammel : Thanks for that clarification, Jack. Second question is completely unrelated. We've been looking at just some of the state data for well productivity in the Permian Basin. And your wells are essentially pretty close to best-in-class. I was just wondering if you could comment on any proprietary technology advantages that you feel that you have in the Permian or is this just a reflection of just better quality rock than others. Is it a combination of the two, any comments you might have? Jack Williams : Yes, we've been \u2013 obviously, we are putting a lot of focus in the Permian right now. And I would say it's kind of a combination of all the above. I mentioned this more kind of cube development. You've heard \u2013 a bit talk about. It's pretty easy to talk about. It's pretty hard to execute it. And as I said, you got to be committed to kind of a lumpy production profile. But we are seeing some very positive results with that methodology. We've seen here from the guys that recently about a 16-well development in the Delaware Basin where we executed that with average well results, about 1,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 16 wells. So, I would say, the combination of the technology organization looking focusing on the Permian.  The delineation results that are coming in positive. they're allowing us more confidence in terms of getting out there and doing these stacked developments, combined with just continuing to go up the learning curve and especially in the Delaware Basin. I think all kind of combining to starting to really hit our stride in the Permian. Jason Gammel : Appreciate that, Jack. Operator : And next we'll go to Blake Fernandez with Simmons Energy. Blake Fernandez : Guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Neil, appreciate the color going into 2Q, and I think you flagged the European volumes. My question was more around the Canadian side of things with Kearl and government curtailments. Do you have any color on how to think about that kind of moving forward versus 1Q levels? Jack Williams : I am sorry. Say that one more time. Blake Fernandez : So, the Canadian piece of the puzzle. Jack Williams : Oh, yes. Blake Fernandez : I think there were some government curtailments in Kearl and I am just trying to understand how we should be thinking about volumes moving forward versus 1Q levels? Jack Williams : Yes, the - we definitely had some production impacts from the curtailments, they weren't hugely significant relative to timing of downtime, unscheduled maintenance and so forth. But there was some impacts, some of the Kearl impact was not that. But we had some impact from Syncrude in that regard. And so overall, there was impact for Upstream for that curtailment activity. I would just kind of make the comment in general about the unintended consequences of that action, which is, there is some curtailment right now. There is production shut-in. And yet, there is spare rail capacity that's not being utilized to get barrels to market. So, clearly, that's not -- that was not an intended consequence and it's not \u2013 it's a market inefficiency right now that the markets having to work around.  So, we hope that that's going to be improved going forward. We think the right market clearing mechanism is that we do have the rail, available rail working. And hope to get that point where it is and that will allow more production be flowing out of Western Canada. Blake Fernandez : Yes, totally agreed. Second question, Jack, you mentioned in the Permian, once you get up to a million barrels a day, that's going to be about half of your inventory. I am just trying to understand the thought process as you get to that and kind of move forward. I mean, at some point, it doesn't make sense to whipsaw up and down. Obviously, you want to keep infrastructure full, et cetera. So, is it kind of a view that once you hit that level, maybe sustaining production is kind of the right way to think about it? Jack Williams : I would tell you that's more or less our current thought. We'll just continue testing that as we get more well results in and as I've said, if we get more bolt-on acreage and so forth, we may test that some further. But you are right, capital efficiency is really important for us. We are set up with this infrastructure to continue to expand those central delivery points.  So, we are planned to have the flexibility to continue to move that plateau level. But that kind of reflects our current plan. The other thing that I'd tell you, I am absolutely confident technology is going to continue to improve. We are going to continue to get some upside in terms of EURs out there and that may also play into re-testing that plateau level. But, I would say right now, that's kind of our base case, that's our case to be. Blake Fernandez : Helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hey, asked and answered. Thanks. Neil Hansen : All right. Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions? Operator : It looks like there are no further questions at this time. Neil Hansen : Okay. Well, we appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight our first quarter that included solid operating performance in a challenging margin environment, continued success in Guyana, excellent progress in the Permian and final investment decisions on key Downstream and Chemical projects.  We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's call. We thank everyone again for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead sir. Neil Hansen : All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation on the call today and your continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today is Neil Chapman. Neil is a Senior Vice President and Member of the Management Committee with responsibility for the Upstream. After I review financial and operating performance, Neil will provide his perspectives on the quarter and give updates on the substantial progress, we've made on the major growth projects across the business. Following Neil's remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I'd also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. Moving to slide 3. Let me start first by summarizing the solid progress we have made on our major growth plans along with other noteworthy accomplishments. Neil will go into more detail after my remarks, but I wanted to take a few moments to touch on some key highlights. For the first half of the year, we've made good progress on our growth plans. The fundamentals and long-term demand growth that underpin our investments remain strong. The competitive advantages we've built into our projects make them robust across commodity price cycles including the margin environment we are currently experiencing. We reached final investment decisions for nine major strategic projects in just the first six months of the year including projects from all three business lines. Offshore exploration success continued with four significant deepwater discoveries; three in Guyana and one in Cyprus and we achieved key milestones in the development of two of our LNG growth projects in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique. Liquids production increased significantly from last year with volumes up 144,000 barrels per day or 7% driven by strong growth in the Permian. We remain on schedule with plans to increase production in the Permian to 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2024, as we also continue to build-out supporting infrastructure and takeaway capacity. In the Downstream and Chemical businesses, recent projects startups in North America and Europe are already making a positive contribution to results. These projects are accretive to earnings even in the current margin environment demonstrating the market resiliency we envisioned when making these investments. In particular, the Baytown steam cracker, which started up last year has performed exceptionally well with production exceeding design capacity by 10%. Lastly, we increased the quarterly dividend by 6% marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Positive momentum we generated in the first half of the year is in line with the plans we laid out in 2018 and reiterated in March and positions us very well to generate long-term shareholder value. I'll now highlight our second quarter financial performance starting on slide 4. Earnings were $3.1 billion in the quarter or $0.73 per share including a positive $0.12 per share impact from a tax rate change in Alberta, Canada. These results were in line with our expectations given the margin environment, seasonal impacts and planned maintenance we experienced during the quarter. The margin environment remained challenging in the second quarter as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and industry product margins. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6 billion in the quarter. After adjusting for changes in working capital, which were primarily seasonal in nature and consistent.  CapEx for the quarter was $8 billion and through the first half of the year CapEx is $15 billion representing 50% of the full year guidance we provided in March. The free cash flow deficit in the second quarter is a result of our strategy focused on the long-term and grow shareholder value across commodity cycles leveraging our financial capacity. I'll now go through a more detailed view of developments since the first quarter on the next slide. Starting first with the Upstream. Average crude oil prices were higher than the first quarter with Brent up $5.63 and WTI up $4.93. ExxonMobil's liquids realizations increased by $5.09 in line with the increase in crude markers. Gas realizations on the other hand were down in the second quarter. This was consistent with the typical three month to six month crude-linked LNG pricing lag that we experienced and a $0.51 decline in Henry Hub pricing as production growth continues to outpace demand in the U.S Gas realizations were also impacted by weaker prices in Europe with lower seasonal demand and an increase in LNG imports. Production in the Permian averaged 274,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 21% relative to the first quarter. Permian production is up nearly 90% from the average production we saw in the second quarter of last year. In addition, the three exploration discoveries in Guyana in the first half of the year, we recently completed construction of the FPSO for Liza Phase 1, Liza Destiny which is now in transit to Guyana. We also made a final investment decision for the 220,000 barrel per day Liza Phase 2 project and we updated the resource estimate to more than 6 billion oil-equivalent barrels. We also progressed toward a final investment decision for the Mozambique LNG project by securing approval of Rovuma development plan from the Mozambique government.  We announced plans to expand unconventional operations in Argentina's Vaca Muerta basin and expanded our growing Deepwater exploration portfolio including the acquisition of 7 million deepwater exploration acres offshore Namibia. In the Downstream, industry refining margins improved during the quarter, but remained near five-year lows. Unrelated reliability events at the Baytown, Sarnia and Yanbu refineries negatively impacted second quarter results. We expanded our Group II lubricant base stocks portfolio with increased production from the Rotterdam hydrocracker and a further expansion in Singapore. Although, long-term fundamentals remain strong in the Chemical business, Paraxylene margins weakened during the second quarter as a result of supply length from recent industry capacity additions. We achieved another important milestone in our plans to grow high-value premium Chemical product sales with the startup of the polyethylene expansion at Beaumont, which will capture integration benefits with the Baytown steam cracker. And once lined out it's expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the current margin environment. We also announced a final investment decision for the Gulf Coast growth venture in Corpus Christi where with our partner SABIC we will construct a 1.8 million ton per year steam cracker and derivative units. We continue to progress research and development of lower emissions technologies. In the quarter, we signed a joint development agreement with Global Thermostat to advance breakthrough technology to capture and concentrate carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources including power plants. We also initiated a partnership with the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and National Energy Technology Laboratory to research and develop a range of lower emissions technologies with a specific focus on ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and storage to commercial scale. Both of these important efforts are aligned with our focus on leveraging fundamental science to develop breakthrough solutions that can help reduce global emissions. Let's now move to Slide 6 for an overview of second quarter earnings relative to the first quarter of the year. Second quarter earnings of $3.1 billion were up nearly $800 million from the first quarter. Upstream earnings were up approximately $400 million driven by higher liquids realizations and onetime tax items, partly offset by lower natural gas prices. Downstream earnings increased by more than $700 million due to improved fuels margins, wider North American crude differentials, and the absence of negative mark-to-market derivative impacts. Improvements in Downstream earnings were partly offset by the previously mentioned reliability events. And finally Chemical earnings were lower by $330 million with higher scheduled maintenance and weaker paraxylene margins. Turning to Slide 7, I'll expand on the impressive year-over-year increase in Upstream volumes. Production in the second quarter of 2019 was 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of more than 260,000 oil equivalent barrels per day relative to the second quarter of last year representing a 7% increase. The higher volume was driven by production growth of 129,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian which represents an 89% increase than the prior year quarter. Increased production from Hebron and Kaombo also contributed to the higher volumes. Lower maintenance in Canada, and the absence of impacts from the earthquake in Papua New Guinea, combined with stronger seasonal gas demand in Europe, provided additional volume uplift. The bottom left chart highlights the strong year-over-year liquids growth of 177,000 barrels per day, an increase of 8% from the second quarter of 2018. Importantly, this marks the highest quarterly liquids production since 2016 and the highest second quarter liquids production in a decade. Moving to Slide 8, I'll review the second quarter of 2019 cash flow. Second quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes of working capital yielded $6 billion in cash flow from operating activities. There was a $1.2 billion draw on working capital in the quarter, driven primarily by lower seasonal payables. This impact is in line with a typical seasonal pattern of a working capital draw in the second quarter which has been on average about $2 billion over the last decade. Other items included the impact from the Alberta tax rate change which resulted in a noncash benefit to earnings of approximately $500 million. While no significant asset sales have completed year-to-date, asset marketing activities are in line with our divestment plans and consistent with our expectation of generating $15 billion from asset sales by the end of 2021. Second quarter additions to PP&E and net investments and advances were $6.9 billion, driven primarily by increased activity in the Permian basin. Gross debt increased by approximately $4 billion in the quarter and cash ended the quarter at $4.2 billion. As I have discussed and as you can see we are leveraging our financial capacity to invest in advantaged value accretive projects through the commodity price cycle. This is an important element of our strategy, so let me provide some additional perspective on the next slide. The chart at the top left of the page provides a view of commodity prices and margins over the past 10 years and the relative position of the environment we've seen in the first half of 2019 to that range. While margins so far this year have been on the low end of the 10-year range across many of our businesses these levels are consistent with historical experience and importantly, consistent with the scenarios that we anticipate when we make investment decisions. In fact even in today's market environment as mentioned the recent Chemical and refining project startups that I recently highlighted are contributing positive earnings and cash flow. The cyclical nature of these businesses makes it critically important to have the financial capacity to invest across commodity price cycles and grow the dividend. Over the past several years we've taken advantage of these downturns and commodity prices to assemble the best set of opportunities that we've had in 20 years and we are now investing consistent with our strategy to capture value from those opportunities. This combination of financial capacity to invest through the cycle and a deep portfolio of attractive investments is unique in the industry. The chart on the bottom left of the page highlights our annual free cash flow generation over the past several years. Cumulative free cash flow over this time period is well in excess of our cumulative dividend. This provided a strong basis to make value accretive investments and grow the dividend over time. And we view those two efforts as being closely linked together. The ability to grow the dividend requires continued investments in accretive, resilient opportunities across price cycles. During times of price volatility, we keep the long term in mind as there can be a number of opportunities to capture incremental value by investing when others are pulling back. With our financial strength and a competitively advantaged portfolio we've been able to invest counter-cyclically in a number of key growth areas taking advantage of attractive low-cost environments. I'll now provide some perspective on our outlook for the third quarter starting on slide 10. In the Upstream, we expect volumes in the third quarter to be in line with the second quarter. We will also see the impact of the absence of the second quarter onetime non-U.S. tax help of approximately $500 million. In the Downstream, we expect Permian crude differentials to narrow as additional takeaway capacity comes online. Industry refining margins are expected to be in line with seasonal demand patterns. Scheduled maintenance in the third quarter should be significantly lower relative to the second quarter. Chemical margins are expected to remain under pressure, as the market continues to work through supply length from recent capacity additions. Consistent with the Downstream, scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the third quarter is also expected to be lower. And I'll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance on the next slide. As we've previously discussed, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream this year will be higher than normal, in part due to preparation for IMO 2020. Planned maintenance and downtime tends to be seasonal, in line with demand patterns. And consistent with this, we expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the third quarter to be lower relative to what we experienced in the second quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, we anticipate maintenance activity to pick up as we enter into the fall maintenance season, but activity again should remain below second quarter levels. The estimated earnings impacts for the third and fourth quarter for the Downstream are shown on the upper left chart. In the Chemical business, shown on the bottom left chart, we also expect lower scheduled maintenance, with the impact in the third and fourth quarters below what we saw in the second quarter. We hope this provides you with some helpful perspectives on key drivers of anticipated market and planned factors for the upcoming quarter. And with that, at this time, I'd like to hand it over to Neil. Neil Chapman : Good morning everyone. It's good to be back on the call. As Neil said, before we take your questions, I'd like to share my perspective on the second quarter results, then I'm going to provide a few updates to the plans that we laid out in our New York March discussions. I want to start by acknowledging the strong liquids growth. As I said many times, volume is not a target. It is an outcome of our plans to grow value. Nevertheless, our liquids growth reflects well on the organization maintaining the schedule in the early stages of executing our Upstream growth plans. In terms of those growth plans, the ones we laid out in New York, I feel we're making outstanding progress. Permian growth is strong and on schedule. Guyana project plans are on or slightly ahead of schedule. And in the Downstream and Chemicals, 11 of the 19 projects that we laid out in New York last year are online and we FID-ed another six in the second quarter, going to provide some further details on these in the following slides. We are in a unique position versus the rest of industry. We have a very attractive opportunity set. These are the advantaged projects that are robust at the bottom of the cycle conditions. So we have a very attractive opportunity set and we have the financial capacity to pursue them in a business that is very cyclical. In the second quarter, three of our major businesses were at low points in their cycles. As you heard from Neil, that's been a major factor on our quarterly results. While we obviously prefer margins to be at the top of the cycle, the current margin scenario was contemplated and we have the financial capacity to maintain our plans. In fact, we've built our growth strategies, based on a full range of potential industry margins and the impact they would have on our financial results. That is why we put such importance on having a strong balance sheet to enable us to proceed with our long-term investment plans and weather through the cyclical nature of our business. On a whole our businesses performed extremely well during the second quarter, actually they have in the first half of the year. Chemicals and Upstream reliability has been excellent and refining has also been strong with the exception of the three discrete incidents. The one in Sarnia, Canada; one in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; and the one in Baytown, Texas that Neil referenced. Although, these are one-offs, they're not systemic to our overall performance. In total, we estimate the second quarter impact from these three instances to be of the tune of $150 million of earnings, that's the earnings impact. Of course, this is disappointing. Baytown and the Yanbu facility are now back in full production and Sarnia will be at marginally lower rates through the fourth quarter. I want to take this opportunity to update you on the fire that occurred at our Baytown olefins plant earlier this week. First and foremost is the safety of our people and those in the surrounding community. I'm pleased to say, there were no reported serious injuries. An investigation into the cause of the incident and the potential damage continues. And frankly at this stage, it's really too early to say much more than that. On the larger point of reliability, of course, it's an important focus area for us. It has been for a long time. We benchmark extensively and our Downstream facilities are ranked consistently better than the industry average. However, we must eliminate the significant one-off events, as we're just not satisfied with being an above average industry performer. We're progressing a comprehensive reliability improvement program that we initiated late last year. This is leveraging insights across our Upstream, Refining and Chemical businesses and it's also reaching out to leaders outside of our industry to ensure that we leave no stone unturned in our drive to lead industry reliability at all times. Slide 14 summarizes the progress of our major portfolio. Starting with the Upstream, I'm going to provide some more details on Permian and Guyana on the subsequent following pages. In Brazil, our Carcara development is proceeding on schedule. We expect to spud the first exploration well on Uirapuru and that's the block that's adjacent to Carcara with our partner Petrobras in the second half of this year. We passed two significant milestones with host government approvals of our development plans for the Papua LNG in Papua New Guinea and Rovuma in Mozambique. In the Downstream, our three investments at Beaumont, Rotterdam and Antwerp these are all upgrading low-value streams to high-value streams, they're lined out and all are contributing to earnings and cash. And in the second quarter, we completed the FID of the three remaining major refinery projects that are in our growth plans. In Chemicals, you the new Baytown cracker and two polyethylene plants are performing well, and the expansion of the high-margin thermoplastic elastomer business in Santoprene started up in May of this year. All these investments are also accretive to current earnings. We started up the third polyethylene plant at Beaumont in July and that was one month ahead of schedule. We also completed the FIDs of four major new world-scale plants in the first half three of which were in the second quarter. At the new polypropylene line at Baton Rouge, our linear alpha olefins plant at Baytown that will be a new product to ExxonMobil's Chemical portfolio and expansion to our industry-leading high-margin propylene plastomer business at Vistamaxx, which is also at Baytown and the largest steam cracker that we have ever built plus the derivatives at Corpus Christi. On slide 15, you can see that our unconventional Permian and Bakken volumes are growing in line with plan. We increased our Permian volumes by 20% in the second quarter, which is up 90% versus the second quarter last year. We're now at 51 rigs and 12 frac crews in the Permian and we brought 67 wells to sales in the second quarter. Our unique development plans which are focused on maximizing long-term value of the resource and leveraging the scale of ExxonMobil to drive capital efficiency are delivering encouraging results. The rocks and well performance is extremely strong. And as I said previously our approach is to understand the impact of development and operating practices on both IP rates and long-term recovery. Drilling a single well and applying a larger completion with higher intensity fracture can yield higher IPs, but it may yield lower ultimate recovery versus drilling several wells with less intense completions. Capital efficiency is critical and it's an area where our team is constantly looking for ways to improve. It's all about balancing capital outlay IPs and the ultimate recovery to achieve the highest value. We've ramped up activity above surface with the ongoing construction of our Cowboy Central Delivery Point facilities in the Poker Lake region of the Delaware. And we finalized the FID to proceed with the greater than one million barrel a day liquids pipeline to the Gulf Coast. The Permian level activity is high and we're making great progress. Page 16, our first FPSO Liza Destiny is en route to Guyana. We started the schedule for the first quarter of next year, but I'm optimistic we'll do better than that. We completed the FID on the second FPSO at Liza-2, which is close to double the size of Liza-1 in the second quarter and that will start up in 2022. The startup of the third FPSO for the Payara and Pacora development remains on schedule for 2023 startup. We've had three further discoveries in the first half of 2019 Haimara, Tilapia and Yellowtail. We're continuing to assess the results of these discoveries and are not yet ready to finalize their resource size. However, the Stabroek resource will be 6-plus billion oil-equivalent barrels and again as I've said before this resource continues to grow. We anticipate three further exploration wells in the second half. They are likely to include Tripletail Uaru and Maku with a potential fourth one to spud before year-end. We currently have three drillships in the basin, and the fourth will be on station in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left, we've included a chart to illustrate the continuing increase in our inventory of future exploration prospects. I've included page 17 to remind you about Upstream divestment plans through 2021. We've previously communicated that we anticipate asset sales of $15 billion. As I said before, the $15 billion is a risk number and anticipate that some of the divestment candidates that we put in the market will not realize our retention value. But the marketing program is on track and includes the assets listed on the right. We're also in marketing discussions in other assets that are not public, so I have not of course listed them here. Again, this program is on schedule and we anticipate delivering the $15 billion previously communicated. Finally on slide 18, a quick update on the significant growth milestones in our integrated ethylene and polyethylene business on the Gulf Coast. The Baytown and Mont Belvieu investments have been aligned for some time. And as I said earlier, are accretive to earnings even at the current low margins. The polyethylene units at Mont Belvieu started up in 2017 and are operating at capacity. The ethylene steam cracker at Baytown, which started up last year is operating at 10% above design capacity. The third polyethylene line at Beaumont started up in July ahead of schedule. This was the first line in the world to start up on the higher value, but notoriously difficult to produce in a gas phase reactor metallocene polyethylene and that was from the first day of operations. We're very pleased that our startup was flawless. In the second quarter, we completed the FID of the largest steam cracker we will ever build, plus the derivatives and they're going to be located in Corpus with our partner SABIC. This will be highly advantaged versus the industry Gulf Coast investments based on location, and of course the adjacency to the Permian lower capital costs and high-value products. Startup is scheduled for 2022. The fundamentals supporting these Chemical investments remain strong. All of this is being done to what we know will be increasing global demand supported by population growth and the growing middle class. In summary, our organization is absolutely focused on delivering the operating performance we expect to-date and on delivering our growth plans. We have a high level of confidence that we will deliver and our performance through the first half of this year demonstrates that we're on track. And with that, Neil I'll hand back to you for Q&A. Neil Hansen : Great. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you for your comments, Neil. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Chapman and Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] We'll take are our first question from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Neil great to have you back on the call. Neil, I've got two questions, if I may. My first one not to be terribly predictable but \u2013 is on Guyana. Clearly, the exploration program Hammerhead you've dedicated both assets to appraisal drilling. I know you're \u2013 as I understand it from your partner you're going off to kind of fully appraise what could be a major development hub in the Longtail Turbot area. So I just wonder, if I could just push you a little bit on why you have not yet chosen to revisit the likely production trajectory, because it clearly looks like you are running well ahead not least because to have a fourth and fifth boat and still had 750 means those would be undersized. So just could you frame for us what you see the potential like today on how that would play into on your 2025 outlook which is clearly out of date? Neil Chapman : Yes, a bit out of date. You know, it's -- what we communicated in March was this big increase getting up to 750 KBD by that time. I would tell you, there is a tremendous amount of activity going on in the basin. I want to start at that point. As we said, we have the first boat on the way. We have the second boat in construction. We have three drillships. We have a tremendous amount of activity going on. And all of these items -- we're going at a great, great pace. We have to get up -- maintain alignment with our partners and with the government on each one. What I'm really focused on and the organization is focused on primarily is delivering on what we communicated to you and to the investment community. And that's the numbers we laid out in March. Of course, as I indicated, there are some -- we're very optimistic that that will be at least what we will do. We're just not ready to make another change to up either the production outlook or at this stage anything more on the resource base. You mentioned Hammerhead. Let me just make a couple of comments on Hammerhead. I think you are aware that we drilled two more wells on Hammerhead recently and the results were positive. I would describe them as reinforcing the high-quality reservoirs. We've now drilled three wells in Hammerhead. They're in communication, the press is in communication, which means there's very good connectivity which again suggests that there's good news at development planning. You talked about appraisal drilling. You know, we're going to be doing some appraisal drilling on Ranger, which we've not quantified yet. That's the large carbonate structure, of course. All of that being said, we just have a tremendous amount of activity going on. I want the organization focused on delivering what we've committed to. And frankly, the next significant update in terms of outlook for production, I don't think we'll give anything different until an update in March next year. Doug Leggate : Well, I can obviously -- well, I didn't want to be impertinent by saying out of date, so let me just clarify what I meant. When you first gave the 2025 target, the guidance was 500,000 barrels a day. It's now more than 750,000 and you still haven't changed the 2020. I know it's a long way away, but that was my point. But my follow-up Neil is probably a little bit an off the ball question, kind of related to the disposal pace on the kind of the use of proceeds. My understanding is that you recently conducted a study with a buy side on opinions on share buybacks return of cash to shareholders and how you would -- how you might consider that in the future perhaps even with a potential to lean on the balance sheet. I'm just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to what was behind that the reason for that survey and whether you're still comfortable with the pace of the disposal program you laid out at the Analyst Day. Now, I'll leave it there. Thanks. Neil Chapman : Yeah. I mean again, Neil can maybe make a comment in a second, on the specifics of the survey. Let me just make some comments on the disposal program. We highlighted $15 billion. I told the investment community that was a risk number. In other words, I anticipate we'll have to put more in the market to achieve that number. We're on track with that. I would tell you we're -- we communicated that in March. We're just four months into a three-month program. And so -- a three-year program rather. And we're on track with the marketing. What we said, at that time, was in terms of our capital allocation that there's no change in the priority continuous -- our use of cash use of capital starts with investing with value-accretive projects. Secondly, we're going to maintain our growing dividend. We want to maintain our financial flexibility and then we'll look at how else -- what else we do with the cash in terms of buybacks. And that's the way, I think we have discussed it for many years and we'll reinforce that in March. Of course, we indicated then that with $15 billion on the planning basis that could result in returning some cash to the shareholders. But we will look at that as that cash comes in, and we'll set that based on the market conditions at the time. Neil, do you want to talk about the survey? Neil Hansen : Yes. No, again just as Neil mentioned, the discussions we've had with a few buy-side firms, I wouldn't classify it as a survey. We certainly reach out to them to talk about how you might execute a buyback program. It wasn't intended to get a different perspective on our capital allocation priority, which as Neil mentioned, remain the same. It was more to gain a perspective from a few buy-side firms on -- if you execute buybacks what's the best approach to do that, what's the philosophy you should take. But again, Doug, I wouldn't classify this as a survey. It was a discussion with a handful of the buy-side firms of some of our larger shareholders. Doug Leggate : Understood. Appreciate the answers guys, and thanks again for getting on Neil. Neil Chapman : Yeah. Thanks, Doug. Operator : Next we'll go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Hi, everybody. Neil financial results in the first half of 2019 seem to be tracking below the plan highlighted at Analyst Day for 2020. Although the company made clear at the time that those projections were predicated upon flat Brent rail and flat Downstream and Chemical margins too. So my question is when adjusting for market factors and whatever else you may deem appropriate, are you still comfortable with the 11% return on capital employed and $25 billion annual earnings figures for 2020? And if so, what factors will help bridge the gap from the first half 2019 actuals to the full year 2020 projections? Or do you think we'll get there solely from normalization of the market factors that Neil mentioned on page 9 in his opening comments? Neil Chapman : Yeah. What Neil is -- I \u2013 again, we got -- we have Neil\u2019s quiet here of course, but if in doubt -- I'm -- this is Neil Chapman. I'm going to answer the question. Doug, I would say, remember when we laid out this plan in March 2018 what we were trying to indicate is the earnings power, the cash flow power that we're bringing into the business at constant prices and at flat margins. At that time, we said we did a flat $60 dollars a barrel and we do it for Chemicals and Downstream at 2017 actual margins and that was our intention. And of course, we go back and skewered our performance. And I think that's what you're asking is how are we doing if you take away the price and margin impacts of the current earnings. I would say we're pretty much matching the plan. The significant -- the concern we've had of course has been these reliability events, particularly the ones that we\u2019ve had in the Downstream. Outside of the ones that we reported in the first and second quarter, there's nothing material that's changed from our plan that we laid out last year. It doesn't mean to say there aren't pluses and minuses. It doesn't mean to say we have some positive surprises and some negative surprises, I think that would be naive to say everything is absolutely perfect. But on average, I would suggest that we're pretty much tracking the plan, and there's no reason at this stage for us to adjust those outlooks that we laid out 18 months or so ago. Doug Terreson : Okay. No, I realize its imperfect, but just wanted to try to get a gauge on it. So, thanks a lot. Operator : Next we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. My first question is about the Permian. The industry for a while now but maybe coming to a head here it seems to be having some issues with spacing and its impact on productivity. We don't have a lot of precise numbers about your spacing, but we do know that your development plan calls for -- call it a high concentration of lateral feet per square mile or they're just -- you have a lot of wells that are stacking up in your section. So can you talk about just broadly this might be too complex a question. I don't want to get too esoteric, but just broadly how you're managing some of these issues we're seeing in the industry given the nature of your development plan in the Permian? Neil Chapman : Yeah. Simon it\u2019s -- of course, like you I read as many of the different results in the industry. I would tell you that in terms of our planning basis, again it's unchanged from the detailed plan that I laid out in March. And what I said at that time that we are driving a different approach than the industry with these really leveraging a combination of this large contiguous acreage that we've had and leveraging the scale of ExxonMobil. And, of course, you will recall that I went through all of that. I also discussed at that time that we are working on plans that we'll develop and drill multiple horizontal benches at one time. Our feeling -- there is communication between these horizontal benches. And if you go in and drill one bench now and expect to come back years later and drill the other benches, we do see or we do believe there's communication between the benches and it should dissipate. And our belief is that drilling of multiple benches simultaneously in the approach that I laid out appears to be the right way to go. We're at the very early stages of that. Frankly it's too early to highlight anything new from what I said back in March of last year. I am aware that there are competitors out there who've looked at spacing and have moved along a line of having closer spacing than we have in our plans. I have heard that. I think everybody in the industry has read about that. My understanding is the company involved in that has pulled back from it. It hasn't been successful. We have not taken that approach. Our spacing is not as tight as that. So it's early days. We have nothing new to report versus what we said last time. As I said, we are on plan and nothing different. Sam Margolin : Okay, thank you. That's helpful. We'll go back to the March materials. My follow-up is on Chemicals and it's sort of a macro question. And you highlighted that there's some margin headwinds in the industry right now due to capacity, but capacity continues to get sanctioned globally. There's FID in the face of this margin pressure. And so I was wondering for your perspective on the demand side. Are you seeing a big pull for new supply in the petchem chain even with some capacity related margin headwinds now? And does that say anything about the longer term cycle and what your high-level views on the chem side are? Neil Chapman : Yeah. Sam I would tell you that and again in Chemical just to break it down to the individual products, and of course we are heavily focused on ethylene and polyethylene and those are the margins that we typically talk about. And Neil highlighted the paraxylene business, but let me talk about ethylene and polyethylene because that's the major driver of our Chemical business. Polyethylene demand grows at about 1.5 times GDP. And as I recall, the ethylene market is about 150 million tons globally. And so what that means is you need three to four new crackers per year just to meet demand, three to four worldscale crackers per year. Actually what we see right now is the demand remains very robust around the world. It's all driven by the growing middle class around the world. That's the driver for plastics, that's the driver for polyethylene. That middle-class having a high standard of living and that drives the assumption of polyethylene. So actually globally we see the demand remaining very robust. There's no changes at all. What happened is there has been a glut of capacity. And so capacity is higher than demand. In the polyethylene business, unlike some of the other commodity businesses we're in, the demand sets it up relatively quickly. Now I will tell you that there are some further increments of capacity in ethylene and polyethylene to come online in the next year or so. So we don't see any change in the fundamentals at all. The glut in supply today is all because of these new capacity increments, most of which are on the Gulf Coast. So I think the short-term margins and if I was to try and predict short-term margins inevitably I would get it wrong, we do. But because of these extra increments of capacity that are coming on in the next 12 months, I would anticipate it to be pretty soft during that period. Now I've been in the chemical business for most of my career I think most of you know. And the Chemical business is notorious for coming back faster than anybody anticipates, but on a planning basis, I'd expect it to remain soft at least for the coming six months. Sam Margolin : Thank you so much. Operator : Next we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Hey good morning. Good to talk to you Neil and Neil. So the first question I had was just around European gas. Obviously we've seen softness in global gas prices. Groningen is a smaller part of the business mix than it was a couple of years ago. But can you just frame out, how big that European gas is as a part of the business on a go-forward-basis? And is that a risk to profitability at the upstream -- of the upstream group? Neil Chapman : Yeah. I mean I'll give you some approximate numbers here, Neil. I think in terms of volumes of gas in our portfolio, about 75% of our volumes from gas is what we call flowing gas, 25% is liquefied natural gas. And of that 75% flowing gas, about half is in the U.S. and half is in the European markets. I'm just going to break it down for you. Of that European, about half is Groningen and half is a combination of as I remember roughly Germany, U.K. and Norway. So it's a relatively large part in terms of volume. It is not a relatively large part in terms of the earnings of our business. What I would tell you is the spot price as you've seen in LNG has dropped significantly, of course, over the last six months. Japanese, JK and market price plus the MVP price in Europe. And that's what's impacting the flowing gas prices. And what we have seen is we have seen continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas in Asia. That's been the growth driver over many years. It's just a little -- it's not as high for the six months of this year as it has been in the previous two years. I mean -- as I remember don't quote me these are approximate numbers. I believe year-to-date Asia LNG demand is up about 3% which is lower than it has been and the global demand or global supply of LNG is up north of 10%. So, what happens there, those cargoes look for a home and they can't find a home in Asia, they will get directed towards Europe that puts pressure on the European price. And if you look at the European gas business, the inventory level is quite high in Europe as well right now. That's what's putting the pressure on the spot LNG price and that's what's putting pressure on the flowing gas price. Neil Mehta : That's helpful Neil. I guess the follow-up is relative to even at the Analyst Day, Exxon's shares have outperformed your smaller independent competitors in places like the Permian. How do you think about the environment for M&A and Exxon's role in consolidation in the Lower 48? Neil Chapman : Well first of all, I'd tell you that, we're eyes wide open. We're always looking for opportunities. I mean -- and I think one of the reasons you maintain a strong balance sheet, it gives you that flexibility to act if you see something of value. I always start in the upstream with this. We have the strongest portfolio of opportunities this corporation has -- in the Upstream this corporation has had since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. In other words we don't need to do anything. I feel very, very comfortable with the growth plans that we have laid out to you and we see and we can execute through 2025 and beyond. So, we have the capacity to do something. We don't need to do anything from a business. What we need to do is execute our current set of opportunities. So, that's a great position to be in. But we look all the time for value-added opportunities. So, I think that's a great part about looking at the portfolio. It's all a question of, if something is out there, which is competitive in our portfolio in other words, upgrades the portfolio and we can bring a competitive advantage versus industry. I mean that's the way we look at it. In the Lower 48, in the Permian specifically, I hear like you all hear a lot of chatter about potential consolidation down the road. But the market -- that will play out in the market. For us, what I like to say to our organization eyes wide open. If there's an opportunity out there, bring it forward. But I really want to make the point that we don't need to act. We don't believe we need to act right now. We have a great opportunity set as it is. Do you have anything to add here, Neil? Neil Hansen : Well, I guess that's absolutely right, Neil. And given the portfolio that we have, we can be patient, we can be opportunistic and if we do see an opportunity to bring unique value with our competitive advantages and we can bring in something that's accretive to the value of our overall portfolio, then obviously we would be very interested in that type of an opportunity. Neil Chapman : Yes I do. Just to go back to the Permian again and reinforce the point I have made my terms. We are taking a different approach to the Permian. I mean we are taking an approach which is leveraging the scale of this corporation. It's a manufacturing approach. We're doing it at scale, which obviously a lot of the small players wouldn't have the capacity to do that. And we're going to do it through the cycles. We have the capacity to do that. We believe we have a significant capital advantage by doing it that way. And as a result of that, I think if we can demonstrate and we will and we are demonstrating that, we can demonstrate it. It puts us in a position where we have an advantage development plan that we could apply that to other resources in the basin should we see fit to do so. Neil Mehta : Thanks, guys. Neil Chapman : Sure. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Yes, hi good morning. I guess my question, my first question, so it's a bit of a follow-up to a couple of questions that have been asked maybe slightly differently. If we look at the quarter, there's a fair amount of debt added this quarter and you talked about kind of just investing through the cycle. You have the $15 billion of asset sales that you're targeting over the next three years and you want to keep the balance sheet ready if an M&A opportunity comes along. But if we look at it that way and think about the way the script looks right now, does it make more sense to not think about share buybacks to just keep the balance sheet in the best shape you can with assets or proceeds as you invest through the cycle? Just want to kind of tie that altogether? Thanks. Neil Chapman : I'll start and then Neil maybe you can add anything you want to add. But I think the strength of this balance sheet is really important of course, but it's being demonstrated by the current market conditions because as I said in my other comments, we feel very strongly. We have the capacity to maintain our investment plans through these low points in the commodity cycle. Actually, we -- at the current conditions if they were maintained and we see these as very low as you have seen and Neil pointed out from his chart, if they were to maintain those conditions, we still believe we have the capacity to execute our plans if these conditions would remain through 2025 and still have some powder to execute an acquisition should we want to do so. But of course, it's something you watch closely. You're constantly looking at that all of the time. But today and on a planning basis, we feel like we have the capacity to make no change at all to our plans. And even if these low margins continued, we can continue with our plans. Neil, do you have anything to add to that? Neil Hansen : Yes. I am just -- thinking back to the Investor Day Phil, when we talked about this, we conveyed that we felt very comfortable with the investment program that we have available to us. We talked about the priority of doing a reliable growing dividend and that we felt comfortable with the balance sheet and that we didn't feel at that time that we need to do any additional maintenance on the balance sheet. And so to the extent, we had proceeds coming from asset sales or additional cash coming from higher prices and margins given where we were in those priorities likely the cash would then come back through buybacks, but that was obviously given a current or an assumed price and margin environment and we are in a different environment today, but when these proceeds come in from these asset sales, which is a target out to 2021, we don't know what environment we will be in at that time. So it's difficult to predict exactly where that cash would go, but we can reaffirm what the priorities are. We're going to continue to invest in accretive projects, pay a reliable growing dividend and ensure that we have the capacity and the financial strength to take advantage of opportunities that become available to us including when we have a downturn in margin to prices which is as we said a very attractive time to operate and invest when costs are lower and when others are pulling back. So, there's no change to the priorities. What happens when that additional cash comes in from those proceeds again, could occur over the next two or three years, it will be dependent I think on the price and margin environment at that time and what opportunities we see available to us. Neil Chapman : And Phil, I'd tell you, this is not something new for us. I mean, if you go back to the low crude oil prices in 2015-2016 that's when we lent into the business and made the acquisitions in the Permian, in Mozambique, in Papua New Guinea and in Brazil. And again, I go back to the strength of opportunities that we have right now is because at that low point in the cycle we have the capacity to move and pick-up some very attractive resources at very competitive prices. Phil Gresh : I appreciate that and obviously you can't time the asset sales quarter-to-quarter so certainly can appreciate that. On the Chemical side, I guess my follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked is that if I look at the performance of ExxonMobil specifically over the past five quarters your earnings have gone down every quarter. And I know this quarter you had some maintenance so some of that will come back here. But if I look relative to other some of your other peers where you have traditionally kind of tracked their performance, I think they have seen a bit better performance recently and yours has continued to degrade and so just kind of shifting through the sides I know you called Paraxylene as one factor. Is that -- if you're to kind of disaggregate the performance would you say that that is the primary factor that you think is differentiating your softer performance recently? Or are there other things we should be thinking about? Thanks. Neil Chapman : Well, I think there are other things. I think what you have to start with in the Chemical business is looking at the configuration of the assets that each Chemical company has and our business is heavily weighted towards steam cracking and polyethylene by order of magnitude and it's sort of 65% of our Chemical business. Polyethylene and ethylene margins for us have been very strong for multiple years and we've benefited from that. And at this stage of the cycle the ethylene polyethylene margins for the reasons that we already discussed are down. If you have a Chemical company that has 25% of its business in ethylene, polyethylene and the rest of the business in other products you probably wouldn't see that impact of ethylene and polyethylene. It's really driven by the configuration of assets that you had. If we look across our Chemical company's performance over the last 12 months in terms of operations, in terms of delivering on their higher-margin growth it's been at or above plan. The total impact we are seeing is because of industry margins being down due to overcapacity. That has been primarily driven by ethylene and polyethylene primarily driven by these big incremental capacity coming on the Gulf Coast. Paraxylene is similar. Paraxylene is also a significant part of our Chemical company nowhere near the size of ethylene and polyethylene. There has been some big capacity increments of Paraxylene that has come online in China in the recent months and that's put Paraxylene margins under pressure. These are cyclical businesses. The performance has no change. The underlying drivers of these businesses are unchanged. The underlying drivers for demand are unchanged. What's really important for us is that we continue to deliver more competitive steam crackers in polyethylene businesses than anybody else. That's why I made the comments when we were talking about the latest investment to Corpus Christi. This is significantly advantaged we believe versus any other Gulf Coast investment. It's a significantly lower capital cost. We're leveraging the scale of our Upstream organization. We located the plant so close to the Permian. It's a cost advantage and we are producing not commodity polyethylene, but higher value or higher margin polyethylene. And so we don't see any change to the structure of this business. This is a margin impact-driven by short-term excess in supply. Phil Gresh : Okay. Appreciate the comment. Neil Chapman : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Good afternoon and also good morning. Thanks for taking questions. Two please. The first is, I hear what you say about M&A opportunities and so on in the Permian and I guess, those will come around periodically and you'll take a look at those when and if they arise. But we've got the surplus transfer rights opportunity coming up in Brazil in November and you could argue that that is somewhat more singular. Neil Chapman : Yes. Jon Rigby : So I just wonder whether you could talk a little more about what your attitude is to that? And maybe if I just add my second question straight away\u2026. Neil Chapman : Sure. Jon Rigby : I was just looking at your CapEx profile in the U.S. in the Upstream and I see it bumping up both sequentially and year-over-year and I guess that may in part have something to do with your comments around infrastructure build out. So I just thought maybe it would be good opportunity if you could just sort of lay out the activity in a little bit more detail around infrastructure as well as the drilling activity. Thanks. Neil Chapman : Yes. Sure. Thanks, Jon. Let me start with the transfer of rights in Brazil. B\u00fazios, which of course, is the big reservoir down there the big resource that's in those transfer of rights. I mean, that's the largest one there are other ones of course, but B\u00fazios is by far the largest. Because it is so large I think everybody in the industry will have a look at that. I'd be very surprised if they didn't. But it is very, very large. It is singular. Those kind of sizes of what I'd call discovered resources it's relatively well-delineated. The way I look at it is we have to bring some advantage to that versus anybody else in the industry. And if I can find a way where we can bring a significant advantage therefore we can get more value for our shareholders and we don't just get into a bidding war versus other players because I mean that's not the business. We want to be able to bring an advantage to that resource should we want to participate. We are looking at that resource as I am very, very confident all the major players are in the world. It doesn't mean to say that we're going to act on it Jon, but we're certainly looking at it. It is a large resource and it will be interesting to see how that plays out. And obviously I don't think you'd expect me to say much more than that. And in terms of CapEx, actually I'm very proud of where we are. With 50% as a corporation of our CapEx plan in the middle of the year and actually if you peel the onion back further with 50% of our CapEx plan in the Upstream halfway through the year as well. So we're tracking in total on plan. It doesn't mean to say there aren't some puts and takes I mean there are. I think in terms of the above surface buildout, particularly in the Delaware basin what I laid out in March is we have to put a lot of upfront money to build out those facilities both compression and these development corridors and all of the logistics within the basin. That's part of our plan. I would tell you there are puts and takes in all of that. Overall, we are on plan. It's well documented that it is taking longer to drill these horizontal laterals in the Delaware right now than it is in the Midland. And you see the numbers -- you've all seen the numbers that are reported externally. Key -- for all the players in the Delaware that we find a way to get those drilling times down closer to what we see in the Midland. We are working that we're making decent progress, of course, I want us to go faster, but we are making decent progress. So there's nothing really to flag outside of what we have already said. It is within the range of what we had expected. And today, our Permian production is accretive to earnings. We are making money in the Permian right now. Jon Rigby : Well, thank you. Neil Chapman : Yeah. Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one, a question on Pay, so, I understand the question for the pace of development in Guyana. And obviously you're taking advantage of the services available at very good prices. For the Permian, are you concerned at all that the pace of your development. And the impact it could have on the overall oil market. I get not all of the growth is oil, but a substantial amount of that exponential growth chart is oil. And then, if you take you guys plus Chevron and a handful of your peers, it looks like the majority of the sector wants to grow volumes faster than the market is growing, which suggests prices may be not that positive over the medium-term. So I just want to get, your thoughts on that. And whether you think it's a concern at all. Thanks. Neil Chapman : Yeah. Thanks, Biraj. I mean again I'll make some comments. And Neil, if you have any feel free, to jump in. I mean, I think, we laid out that pace and we said we are going to get to one million oil-equivalent barrels in the Permian and Bakken by 2024, if I remember correctly. That's not driven by anything more than we see these. And it's extremely competitive. We see them as less outside of the supply curve. And we see them as high returns and within our capacity to execute them to the standards that we expect to execute them. That's the way we look at it. What really is important, in a commodity cycle, in commodity businesses, is to make sure that, we have a competitive advantage versus anyone else in terms of cost of supply. And it's really driven by cost of supply. That's why I am so keen, that we maintain our capital discipline in the Permian. We must continue to work the capital cost down and to deliver on what we have laid out in our plans. Remember, this is a declining business. You have to keep replacing your capacity. And what's key for us. And key to win in this business is to make sure that our portfolio is the most competitive in the industry. And that's the basis of these plans. And the Permian is a big part of that. Do you have anything to add on that? Neil Hansen : No. I guess the only thing I would add globally the market again remains balanced. Demand growth continues to be strong. Obviously, OPEC has remained committed to their cuts. You have oil that's off-line in Venezuela and Iran and other locations. So you are seeing growth in the Permian. But I think overall, we are still seeing a relatively balanced market. Operator : All right. Your next question goes to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Roger. Neil Chapman : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : If we could come back to I think it was slide 9, the one showing the margins. And kind of where you are relative to the 10-year, I was just curious, so as we look particularly at the downstream and the Chemicals. If you think about those margin performances call it a lost opportunity or adjusted for your downtime, kind of how much was truly margin loss versus had you run at a normal level of activity, where you think those margins might have been? Can you help us think about maybe where cash flow should be back half of this year, given maybe more normalized levels of downtime? Neil Chapman : Yeah. Well. I'll make sure you I understand the question, Roger. What would be the impact, if we didn't have the reliability incidents, is that your question? Roger Read : Yeah. What if we were to isolate only the margin aspect in terms of price or let's just say net margin the industry offered versus net margin you captured? Neil Chapman : Yeah. I think two things to bear in mind. I think in terms of our performance, in the first half of the year. And the second quarter in refining, I highlighted in my comments, that there was $150 million earnings impact from those three significant reliability events. Isolate those and that gives you a number. There is a much larger impact from the heavier turnarounds, scheduled maintenance that we have. And Neil gave some numbers in terms of how that would manifest and how that will change in the third and fourth quarter. I don't know, Neil, if you have anything else to add? Neil Hansen : Yeah. And Roger again, just so I understand what you're asking. The charts on slide 9, those are industry margins. Those are not the realization that we captured. Those are again somewhat reflective obviously of our footprint. But they are industry margins. Neil Chapman : I think the other thing to -- really, really important here is, the industry margins manifest themselves differently in each of the refinery players. It depends on your configuration. Just to give an example, if you have no refining assets in Europe and the European margins are low of course that will hit the European players. And not hit the players who don't have a footprint in Europe. And even if you just go into one region, like the United States, the refineries are different. Some are high conversion refineries, some are low conversion refineries. There are different margins, for high and low margin. In the U.S. there are different margins on the Gulf Coast versus the Midwest. And so, when you look at these margins, you have to peel back the onion further and apply the specific margins to the individual configuration, both geographic and technical configurations of your refining assets that differs from company to company. What has been shown on the chart that Neil showed, was I think was an average of industry or an industry market price of this. Neil Hansen : Yeah. That's right. And Roger, maybe just from a downtime, maintenance, earnings impact in the first half of the year. I think for the Downstream in the second quarter we showed on Chart 11 it's in roughly $500 million $600 million. So I think the first quarter was a little bit lower than that. And then for Chemicals, it was a little bit below $200 million. And then we tried to show, on slide 11, what that looks like in the third and fourth quarter. So again down significantly, I think from what we have seen in the second quarter. Hopefully, that gives you some indication where we will be in the second half of the year. Neil Chapman : Roger just to go back to my point on slide 9 that was Downstream margins, that reflects an equal weighting a-third, a-third, a-third of markets in the U.S. Europe and Asia. And so it's an average. It's an illustrative. But if you don't have a-third, a-third, a-third in those three regions then your margins could be different than that. Roger Read : Yeah. For sure, I appreciate the clarification. Because my original interpretation was that was your margins not just industry margins. Neil Chapman : Yeah. Roger Read : Okay. Neil Chapman : Thank you. Roger Read : And then just as a follow-up question on the Permian. I mean, I know we have the chart that shows the pace there, but phenomenal performance in Q2 and familiar with timing of well completions things like that. As you think about Permian growth at this particular juncture is what we saw in Q2, what you believe becomes more representative? Or Q2 is just kind of one of those quarters where you're zigging and zagging a little bit? Just zigs just above the line and maybe over the next couple of quarters we zag back towards the line. As Sam mentioned, we don't have a lot of clarity on a lot of what you're doing out there or at least not contemporaneously. So I was just curious to how you think about the performance in the Permian? And maybe where that shakes up? Neil Chapman : Your vocabulary on zigging and zagging, I describe it as a lumpy. And the reason I say, it's lumpy is, because the way we are developing the Permian is that we can drill a lot of docks and we can frac a lot at different times. So I don't anticipate and if you go back to the chart when you see or read our actual performance, that's kind of what you're going to see. You're not going to see the same growth every single quarter. But we are very confident that we can meet that what's a green famously called the green blob. But the green growth profile, Roger I'd say that's what we are going to -- we will meet. You\u2019re absolutely right, it will be a zigging and zagging, but it is not necessarily the way everyone would develop. It reflects our development plan that we're going to have particularly in the Delaware, these long corridors of well pads. And we're going to drill up multiple benches at one time. And if you think about it move those drilling rigs down the corridor bring in those frac crews, frac them and then you'll see a boost in production. So I don't think it will be the right thing to do to look at every single quarter and say that we'll repeat that growth rate every single quarter. But I am very confident that we're going to meet the overall growth rate that we represented in that famous green production growth zone. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Neil Chapman : Sure. Operator : Next we'll go to Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard Weil. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys. Good morning. Neil Chapman : Hi, Paul, thanks. Paul Cheng : I have one Downstream, one Upstream. Neil for Permian, I think in March June you was mentioning that the rig count will probably go to about 55 exit rate this year and then next year may go to 60, 65 depends on the activity level. Is that still some of digging pain at this point or that has been changed based on the additional information you have seen over the last several months? Neil Chapman : Yeah. I would say the 55 number is a number that I would still think we will be at the year-end, and we haven't got any change in plan on that. I really don't -- I don't get fixated on the number of rigs quite frankly. I mean that was a sort of what we estimate we will have. If the productivity of these wells is better, we could reduce, I mean, that's all about this capital efficiency that I keep coming back to. So as a planning basis, I mean, today we are up what I say 51, I think across both basins right now. That's in line with getting to sort of that 55 number call at the year-end, but it could be 53, it could be 56, 55 is the best planning basis I can give you. Paul Cheng : Sorry. I guess my question is that I mean based on what you see over the last several months in the productivity and everything or within that I feel basically that is still the same plan that you haven't really changed. There's no material information that you have seen either improvement nor deterioration comparing to your current plan? Neil Chapman : Yeah. I mean, there is nothing to flag, because it is within the range of our planning basis. I mentioned a few minutes ago, what's really important is to increase or improve the drilling time in the Delaware. I read about numbers and people are saying in the industry that it is taking 30% longer to drill the same length well same length lateral in the Delaware as it is in the Midland. Actually, I think it's a little bit different than that. There are some parts where that's too high and depending on the length of the lateral exchange, but it is indicative that it is taking longer, and that is a key activity for us to get that drilling time down, because this is obvious, if you can't get that drilling time down to the level that you expect to in your planning basis, you can do one of two things. You can cut back your volumes so you can add more rigs. We still believe in our planning basis, we will get the productivity that we have and that reflects the number of rigs, the capital outlay and the volumes that we're predicting. But it is the most important thing Paul, I would tell you. Paul Cheng : Sure. Neil Chapman : And the way we're going about it is we have moved the total ExxonMobil capability into this basin. We are applying all of our drilling capabilities from all around the world to this very, very important area. And I feel very, very confident in our plans, I feel very comfortable with where we are heading. I wish we could close that gap faster. Paul Cheng : And I think your -- from a rig count standpoint you're about 50-50 between Midland and Delaware. Should we assume that will be the case for the next one or two years? Neil Chapman : Yeah. Actually, I'm not sure we're 50-50 right now. We're still -- we have more rigs in the Delaware today than we do in the Midland, but that's part of our development plan in the order of magnitude, if I remember, I think we have maybe, I think it is 29 in the Delaware and 22 in the Midland right now just for the numbers. But our resource, our well inventory in the Delaware is much, much higher than it is in the Midland. And I think we've been quite clear and again I come back to -- this is such an early stage to jump to conclusions. And just to give you an indication, we estimate we have a well inventory in the Delaware of something around 6,500. So 6,500 well inventory, we drilled 100. We drilled 100. So it's very tough to extrapolate from 100 wells where you're going to be with 6,500. And that's why I think it's so, so important that we stick to our long-term planning basis. We know what we have got to do, but to try and extrapolate and draw too many conclusions from that number of wells, I think it just needs -- I think we need to be careful about doing that. Paul Cheng : Right. Final question for me under the IMO 2020 world most of your ability in your refinery to take the high sulphur we see it as a feed directly to the coker with minimal system? Neil Chapman : Yeah. I think as you know if you could sort of peel back the onion at IMO with these new regulations the shipowners have this multiple option. They can buy low sulfur fuel oil, they can install scrubbers or if they can switch to some other piece like liquefied natural gas.  The way that plan plays out is the demand for high sulfur recedes, we would anticipate it will decline and the demand for low sulfur will increase. And you would anticipate so that will -- that could lead to changing spreads of course. I think if you have low conversion refineries, you'll be incented to run -- to reduce sulfur by running sweet crudes. Our refineries particularly on the Gulf Coast are high conversion refineries with low fuel oil production. And so we would say that we feel very well positioned in the U.S. We have high conversion refineries. We added this big new coker in Antwerp and we're investing in projects that reduce high sulfur fuel oil production in Singapore. So we've been planning this for a long, long time. The market will do what the market will do, but directionally we feel like we sit in a very strong and advantage position. Paul Cheng : Sure. I guess my question is that I mean, can you take the high sulfur fuel oil and directly feed it into your coker as a feedstock instead of buying heavy oil? So replace the heavy oil run your refinery by using the high sulfur fuel oil I guess that's my question. Neil Chapman : I think the answer to that is yes, if we have spare capacity. I mean, I think that's the bottom line on that. That's what they're there for. You can do that. But of course, we're balanced across that's why we invested in the coker to size it for our facilities across Europe. But the answer is, fundamentally yes, you could do that if you have capacity. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thanks. Neil Chapman : Thank you, Paul. I think we have time for one more question. Operator : We'll take our last question from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yeah, hey. Thanks for taking my question a the end of the call. Firstly, we didn't touch on a couple of projects. The Mozambique LNG development and what's going on in Papua New Guinea. You did put in your press release that you still expect to sanction Mozambique at the end of this year, but there's been some reporting that you're looking at maybe changing who's doing the EPC on that project and I'm wondering if that could delay when you would sanction it? And then just any updates on what's going on at Papua New Guinea with negotiations with the government would be helpful. Thanks. Neil Chapman : Sure, Jason. I think in Mozambique, we're still proceeding on the planning basis that we have for Area 4 and the two lines that we're going to put in Rovuma. There is likely to be at least we read there will be a change in ownership on Area 1, of course everyone reads that and Patrick made some comments and I think earlier on this week publicly that we have had some very, very preliminary discussions with Total to say, is there something more we can do to between Area 1 and Area4 to get the capital costs down. That's a very, very early stage, because of course that ownership has not changed yet. But I think as Patrick said, if there's something there in the interest of both companies, so for sure we will look at that to improve the capital efficiency. But no change right now in our current planning basis. I think Patrick's comments were more talking about if something comes down the road then it's advantageous to both companies or both consortiums more Area 1 Area 4 than obviously we would look at it. But our planning base is to go ahead with what we've already communicated. In terms of Papua New Guinea and the Papua LNG change of government there President, Marape is in power and I met with him about one month ago. And as he has publicly said and as petroleum minister has said they want to look at the legal aspects of Papua. Our understanding is they've had that review and they're discussing the outcome of that review now. As far as we're concerned, we have an agreement with the government. Prime Minister, Marape understands that. And I don't see any change, but we'll have to wait and see what comes out of the government discussions. I have to say, Total is the operator on this block, so you really have to talk more details with them. As far as we're concerned, we have a contract and we honor our contracts and we anticipate no change in that agreement. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. If I could just ask a question another one about chem. I know it's been covered pretty in depth today, but a peer had mentioned that they're seeing destocking in the China Chemical landscape in terms of inventory and there's been discussions kind of about an emerging naphtha oversupply. And I was just wondering if you're seeing one China kind of tapering back its feedstock costs per purchases? And if that is reverberating through the supply chain particularly for naphtha? Thanks. Neil Chapman : Just to make sure I understand Jason. You're talking about destocking of polyethylene? Jason Gabelman : No. So kind of not buying as much feedstock cost for their naphtha crackers and the inventory on hand. Neil Chapman : I think it's pretty typical in a commodity business. People raise their inventory levels and reduce their inventory levels. Sometimes people speculate in terms of where they think prices are going and margins are going that's typically why people do that. I don't know if in China there's a destocking and folks believe that there is going to be some change in naphtha price. Naphtha is driven by of course fundamentally by expectation on crude oil price, but also the differential between naphtha and crude is driven by the supply/demand of naphtha. So I really -- I hate to speculate on why they're destocking. I think what you have seen in the markets over the last 12 months is relatively low naphtha prices versus crude oil. And I think that's primarily driven by this it is more like crude is on the market which leads to more condensate, which leads to more naphtha. And so you're seeing a trend in that over recent months. But I think it would be to speculate on short-term destocking in China I don't think I can add anything to that. Neil? Jason Gabelman : Thanks. Neil Hansen : Thank you. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity today to highlight the second quarter that concluded. Again, excellent progress in the Permian and the achievement of a number of key milestones across our portfolio. I appreciate your continued interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir. Neil Hansen : All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I\u2019m Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. During today's call, I'll review our financial and operating performance and provide updates on the substantial progress we've made on our major growth projects. I'll be happy to take your questions following my prepared remarks. My comments this morning will reference the slides available on the investor section of our website. I'd also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of the presentation. Moving to Slide 3 let me begin by summarizing the excellent progress we've made this year on plans to grow shareholder value. The long-term fundamentals that underpin our investments remain strong. We've generated nearly $9 billion in earnings through the first nine months of the year with a portfolio that is resilient to a range of commodity prices and margins. We are investing in advantage projects that will grow the earnings and cash generation capacity of each of our businesses. Nearly $23 billion of CapEx year-to-date is in line with current year plans and reflect strong execution of key deliverables. Liquids production has increased significantly from last year with volumes up 131,000 barrels per day or 6%, driven by strong growth in the Permian. We remain on track to meet the full year outlook of producing 4 million oil equivalent barrels per day this year. In addition, efforts to high-grade our portfolio are proceeding ahead of schedule, putting the consideration from the agreement we signed to sell non-operating upstream assets in Norway. The divestments now totaled nearly $5 billion. Exploration success has continued this year with five significant deep water discoveries, four in Guyana and one in Cyprus. And we've reached final investment decisions for 10 major strategic projects this year, including projects from all three business lines. We also increased the quarterly dividend by 6% marking the 37th consecutive year of dividend growth. Finally, the strength of our balance sheet provides us with the capacity to invest through the cycle with leverage at just 12%. The positive momentum we've generated so far this year is in line with the plans that we laid out in 2018 and reiterated in March and positions us well to generate long-term shareholder value. I will now highlight third quarter financial performance starting on Slide 4. Earnings were $3.2 billion in the quarter or $0.75 per share, putting a positive $0.07 per share impact from a one-time tax item. The results were consistent with expectations given the margin environment, seasonal impacts and planned maintenance experienced during the quarter. Crude oil prices declined relative to the second quarter while refining margins improved. Broader margin environment remained challenging as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and industry chemical and lube based oil margins. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $9.5 billion in the quarter, after adjusting for changes in working capital, cash flow was $8 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $7.7 billion. PP&E adds and net investments and advances, which is a proxy for cash CapEx was $6.6 billion and that ratio is consistent with our rule of thumb, that cash CapEx is generally 85% of total reported CapEx. Free cash flow in the quarter increased to $2.9 billion reflecting higher cash generation and moderately lower investments in the quarter. I'll now go through a more detailed view of developments since the second quarter on the next slide. In the Upstream, both liquids and gas realizations were lower in the third quarter, consistent with a decrease in liquids markers and continued gas supply length. Production was in line with our expectations with continued growth in the Permian. The Liza destiny FPSO is currently being commissioned in Guyana and we announced the fourth discovery of this year with the Tripletail exploration well. We also made considerable progress on our $15 billion divestment program reaching an agreement to sell our Norway non-operated assets. In the Downstream refining fuels margins improved during the quarter with supply tightness and stronger distillate demand in Asia and Europe. On the other hand, North American logistics differentials narrowed, primarily driven by the addition of Permian pipeline capacity. Lower scheduled maintenance, most notably the completion of turnaround activities at our Joliet refinery and improved reliability relative to the second quarter contributed to stronger downstream financial performance. Although long-term fundamentals remains strong in the chemical business, polyethylene and aromatics margins continue to be impacted by supply length from industry capacity additions. The recent startup of the polyethylene expansion at Beaumont is performing well and running above planned rates. Supporting efforts to grow sales of high-performance, metallocene products had delivered sustainability benefits including lighter-packaging weight, lower energy consumption, and reduced emissions. Lower scheduled maintenance across U.S. Gulf Coast sites continue \u2013 contributed to improved chemical earnings, although this was partly offset by a reliability event at Baytown. We also progressed research and development of lower emissions technologies. We entered into an agreement with Mosaic Materials to explore a breakthrough carbon capture technology using metalorganic frameworks to separate carbon dioxide from the air. The agreement expands our carbon capture technology research portfolio and will enable evaluation of opportunities for industrial uses at scale. We also signed an agreement with the Indian \u2013 the Indian Institute of Technology. This partnership will focus on progressing research in biofuels and bioproducts, gas transport and conversion, and other low-emissions technologies for the power and industrial sectors. This expands our portfolio of research collaborations, which now stands at more than 80 universities, five energy centers, and multiple private sector partnerships. Let's move now to Slide 6 for an overview of third quarter earnings relative to the second quarter of this year. Third quarter earnings of $3.2 billion were up $40 million from the second quarter. Upstream earnings declined by approximately $1.1 billion driven by lower liquids realizations and the absence of a favorable tax item. Downstream earnings increased by nearly $800 million with lower scheduled maintenance and stronger industry margins. Improvements in downstream earnings were partly offset by the decline in North American differentials. Chemical earnings increased by $50 million with lower scheduled maintenance, partly offset by the reliability event at Baytown. Finally, Corp and Fin earnings increased by $300 million due to the previously mentioned favorable tax item. I'll review changes in Upstream volumes on Slide 7, production in the third quarter was 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 113,000 oil equivalent barrels per day relative to the third quarter of last year, representing a 3% increase. The higher volumes were driven by growth of 123,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the Permian, representing a 72% increase from the prior year quarter. The third quarter cash profile is shown on Slide 8, third quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital yielded $9.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities. There was a $1.6 billion release of working capital in the quarter, driven primarily by inventory effects related to maintenance activities. Other items included the favorable one-time non-cash tax item. Our divestment program is progressing well and ahead of schedule. Third quarter proceeds from asset sales includes a deposit for the $4.5 billion Norway asset sale and the cash received for the sale of our Mobile Bay asset. Third quarter additions to PP&E and net investments in advances were $6.6 billion. Gross debt increased by approximately $2 billion and cash ended the quarter at $5.4 billion. I\u2019ll now provide an update on the excellent progress we are making on key investments across all of our businesses, a summary is provided on Slide 9. Starting with the upstream, growth plans in the Permian and Guyana remain on track and I'll provide some additional details on these projects in the coming slides. In Brazil, we expect the Petrobras operated Uirapuru well to commence drilling in the fourth quarter. In the downstream, three new projects are online and performing well, supporting increased production of cleaner, higher-value products. We've made final investment decisions this year for four additional projects including the Beaumont light crude expansion and the Wink to Webster pipeline, both of which will support our integrated Permian strategy and growth plans. In our chemical business, with the recent start-up of the Beaumont polyethylene expansion, we now have eight new facilities online with four additional projects receiving final investment decisions this year. Moving to Slide 10. I'll provide an update on our unconventional business. Permian growth remains on track with production averaging 293,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. Although, we are in the early stages in the development of this significant resource, results are encouraging, including continued strong well performance. Construction of processing and takeaway capacity also continues. An important milestone this quarter was the completion of the Phase 1 of the Delaware central delivery point and the pipeline to the Wink terminal. I'll provide an update on Guyana on Slide 11. Commissioning of the Liza Phase 1 FPSO is underway and on schedule. The target for achieving first oil is December, dependent on favorable weather conditions. This was placed start-up within five years of initial discovery, well ahead of the typical pace for the industry of closer to nine years. Liza Phase 2 engineering and construction is progressing well, following FID earlier this year. And we're also working with the government to receive necessary project approvals for Payara with the plan start-up in 2023. The Tripletail discovery which we announced in September, marked the fourth exploration success of 2019, the well encountered 108 feet of high quality oil-bearing sandstone and we are also pleased to highlight that with deeper drilling on the well, additional hydrocarbon reservoirs were encountered, providing potential upside to this \u2013 to the initial discovery. We continued to progress considerable undrilled potential in Guyana with a fourth drilling ship, which will commence exploration activity in the fourth quarter. Three upcoming wells, Uaru, Mako, and Hassa are planned to spud in the upcoming months. Locations of those Wells are highlighted here on the map. I\u2019ll now provide some perspectives on the upcoming IMO 2020 implementation on Slide 13. The chart on the left highlights the coking capacity advantage we have relative to our integrated peer group. A position we recently strengthened with a start-up of the Antwerp coker. This new facility upgrades bunker fuel oil, currently produced in our Northern European refineries to higher value products, including ultra-low sulfur diesel. The middle chart shows the clean/dirty spread using Asia gas oil and high sulfur fuel oil. As you can see, the spread is expanding with the forward curve and third-party estimate ranges showing further widening, which will favor more complex refiners with the capacity to upgrade heavier sour crudes to cleaner products. And just to give you some additional perspective, a general rule of thumb for our portfolio is that for every dollar per barrel change in the clean/dirty spread, downstream annual earnings will increase by approximately $150 million. Now a large portion of the benefit comes from the associated widening of the light-sweet and heavy-sour crude spreads, and our ability to leverage coking capacity to run higher quantities of discounted crudes. Now turning to Slide 14, I'll provide additional details on our portfolio management activities. We've made considerable progress on our 2021 divestment objective of $15 billion, reaching an agreement to sell our non-operated Norway assets for $4.5 billion. The sale includes ownership and more than 20 fields and is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals. The sales price of $4.5 billion is subject to interim period adjustments with an effective date of January 1, 2019. Estimated total cash flow from the divestment is approximately $3.5 billion after closing adjustments, with expected 2019 cash proceeds of $2.6 billion. And we will receive another $0.9 billion of non-contingent consideration and tax refunds over the next few years. We are also progressing marketing activities involving, but not limited to, assets in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan and Malaysia. I'll now provide some perspective on our outlook for the fourth quarter starting on Slide 15. In the Upstream, we expect production to increase in the fourth quarter, largely driven by seasonal gas demand, and I'll provide some additional detail on the seasonality of gas demand on a following chart. With regards to the Norway divestment, again, assuming regulatory approvals are received, we anticipate the sale will close in December and that we will recognize an earnings gain of approximately $3.5 billion. [Technical Difficulty] potential for further expansion of clean/dirty and sweet/sour spreads as preparations for the IMO spec change continue. Higher scheduled maintenance in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is also expected to impact results Chemical margins will likely remain under pressure in the fourth quarter as the market continues to work through supply length from recent industry capacity additions. Scheduled maintenance in the Chemical business in the fourth quarter should be generally in line with third quarter levels, and we expect continued recovery from the third quarter reliability event at Baytown. I'll provide some additional details on scheduled maintenance on a subsequent slide. The chart on Slide 16, shows the increase in volumes on oil equivalent basis that we typically experience from higher gas demand in Europe in the fourth quarter. And as you know, gas demand is highly seasonal and driven by weather conditions. Fourth quarter gas demand has been on average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day higher than the third quarter, and we expect a similar trend to occur this year. Turning to Slide 17, I'll provide some perspectives on our fourth quarter outlook for Downstream and Chemical scheduled maintenance. As previously mentioned, scheduled maintenance in the Downstream this year is higher than normal, again, in part due to preparation for IMO 2020. Planned maintenance tends to be seasonal, in line with demand patterns. We expect the impact from scheduled maintenance in the fourth quarter to be higher relative to what we experienced in the fourth quarter \u2013 in the third quarter. The estimated earnings impacts for the fourth quarter and first quarter 2020 for the Downstream are shown on the upper left chart. In the Chemical business, shown on the bottom left chart, we expect scheduled maintenance levels to be generally in line with the third quarter and significantly below the peak we saw in the second quarter of this year. I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few key messages on Slide 18. In the Upstream, we are delivering on plans to grow liquids production and high-grade the portfolio. Recent project start-ups in Downstream and Chemical, continue to perform well, and we reached final investment decisions for eight key projects so far this year. We are also leveraging our significant financial capacity to progress advantaged investments through the cycle, maintaining constancy of purpose on our commitment to grow long-term shareholder value across a range of market environments. Finally, but importantly, we are building on our extensive network of partnerships to develop new technologies to address the dual challenge of providing reliable and affordable energy, while mitigating impacts to the environment, including the risk of climate change. And I'll be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Hansen. [Operator Instructions] First question will come from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Neil Hansen : Hi, good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : Neil, in U.S. Upstream, you mentioned that the key factors this period were realizations, divestitures, output gains, but also higher growth expenses. And on this point, I want to see if we could get more color on the last item, since we can gauge the others to some degree and specifically are these higher growth expenses primarily the Permian? If so, do you consider them to be transitional in nature and when will they become less significant? And then thirdly, are they tracking with your expectations? So three questions on the higher growth expenses item in U.S. Upstream. Neil Hansen : Yes. I appreciate the question, Doug. So just focusing on U.S. Upstream, so if you look at the change in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, earnings declined by roughly $300 million. Most of that was price, so it was about $190 million impact on price in the Upstream. We did have a few other factors, including some downtime and maintenance in non or unconventional assets, including La Barge and Prudhoe Bay, that had an impact as well, and then we did have some higher growth expenses. Most of that does it relate to the progress that we're making in the Permian. And maybe I can just touch on that really quick. I mean I think obviously, we feel really good about the volume growth that we see out there. The resource continues to respond very well. We're making good progress on the development plan that we have in place, including making sure that we capture the full value of the resource. If you're using our logistics position to bring barrels to our refineries and chemical plants, the pace of development is consistent with the plans that we laid out. I think we finished the third quarter with 55 rigs and roughly 10 frac crews, and as I mentioned, volume growth relative to last year in the same quarter was 72%. But we're early in the development. We've only drilled, I think a few hundred wells and that's on a well inventory in excess of 8,000. So it's pretty early days, but we feel like we're making really good progress, we're leveraging the full strength of the corporation and bringing our unique competitive advantages, the scale, the technology. We're leveraging sophistication in the sub-surface using reservoir modeling, we're bringing drilling engineers from all of the world that have expertise in dealing with some of these environments, and of course, our project management capability. So I think in terms of pace, I think, the OpEx is where we would expect it to be. Now when we think about the development, we're trying to balance certainly well productivity. We want to do well there, but we're balancing that with ensuring we excel in terms of ultimate recovery and then, of course, capital efficiency. So that \u2013 those are the three elements we're trying to balance. I think we feel good about where we are. I think we've said that this is a very resilient asset. Even at $35 a barrel, we expect to generate a 10% return. So I would expect, even though we feel like we're where we should be at this point, you can fully anticipate as we bring technology to this, as we bring expertise and drilling in the sub-surface, our project management capabilities, we will only become more efficient over time and drive down those costs. I mean we're never satisfied with where we are, and we always can feel like we can get even better. So really good progress, but also very high expectations in the organization that will only get better in developing the resource. Doug Terreson : Okay, and so it seems like if the production curve steepens in 2020 and beyond, then we'll see pretty strong results from that asset. So, okay well, thanks a lot, Neil. Neil Hansen : Yes. Thanks, Doug. I appreciate the question. Doug Terreson : You're welcome. Operator : Next we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hey, good morning. Neil Hansen : Hey, Sam. How are you? Sam Margolin : I'm good, thanks. So thanks for the color on the Norway sale. I mean, based on the gain there, it looks like this asset was pretty much fully depreciated and it sort of stimulates a question about maintenance spending around some of these longer-tail assets, whether or not the whole industry has kind of deferred that activity and these assets that are mature, sort of, changing hands into more local entities that are incentivized differently to spend. So is that sort of the right read on the overall landscape for divestitures, and if so, what does that mean for your baseline spending irrespective of the growth columns that you have, and maybe even a macro tangent, if you have time to? Neil Hansen : Yes. I appreciate the question, Sam. Again we feel really good about the progress we're making on that divestment program and the fact Norway was accelerated. So that's why we feel we're ahead of schedule. We didn't anticipate being able to execute that divestment this year. So I think the organization has done a nice job of progressing that objective. But I think you all should recognize the reason we're pursuing the divestment program primarily is given the fact that we have brought so many attractive assets into the portfolio, you think about Permian and the Guyana, the LNG projects, that has placed pressure on the organization to high grade even more so, than we have in the past. When we look at asset sales and what assets we might consider high-grading, Sam, it's generally going to be driven by strategic fit, it's going to be driven by the materiality of the asset, its growth potential. We also take into account things like whether or not we operate and have control afford investment plans, I don't want to convey, certainly from our perspective or from an industry perspective that their forgoing needed maintenance to ensure that these facilities are running well and that we're maximizing production from them. So I think it's probably more so for us, Sam. It's more a factor of this pressure that we feel because the portfolio has really increased in terms of attractiveness and value. We feel like there is an opportunity for us to high grade the portfolio, and even \u2013 having this opportunity to even grow more, the overall value by high-grading out our assets. Sam Margolin : Okay, thanks so much. And then my follow-up, sort of, on the other side, on the acquisition front. Bearing in mind the comment about resilient returns in the Permian, double digit down to $35 oil, I think that has more to do with your development plan than necessarily prevailing trends in the industry, because certainly it doesn't look like the independents can make similar claims. So what does that mean in terms of where we're at in the cycle for you too if you think about bolting on some assets here? It seems like you can add value to some distressed situations. Thank you. Neil Hansen : Yes. I appreciate it, Sam. So I think if I step back with what we're trying to do, we're managing a portfolio, and as good as we feel about the opportunities that have come in \u2013 and you mentioned Permian, Guyana and some of the other assets we've been able to bring in, as good we feel about that, the objective remains trying to grow the overall value of that portfolio. We're trying to increase the pie. And so we never sit still. We're always looking at additional opportunities that we think we can bring in into the portfolio. And so I think that certainly would include M&A, it includes looking at any other additional opportunity that's out there. Now for it to come into the portfolio, obviously, it's going to have to compete with what already is in our portfolio. That's certainly one measure of consideration. And the other thing is for us, we have to see an opportunity where we can bring a unique value where we can leverage our competitive strengths to offer something that the industry can't provide or can deliver, and so it's something we're looking at very closely. We are in a fortunate position given the portfolio that we have, that we can be very choosy. We're very fortunate, and that we have the financial strength, the balance sheet capacity to transact at any level and any cycle. And so that gives you a nice \u2013 a nice spot to be in and to be very, very selective in what you're pursuing, very selective in what you're trying to do, because whatever we bring in, is going to have to compete with what's already in the portfolio. So Sam, I think the environment is generally pretty good. There are a lot of things to look at, there's a lot of things to consider. I think for us it's just a question whether or not we can transact at the right value, whether or not we can add unique value to the asset given our competitive advantages and our strengths. But have no doubt, the objective is that we want to continue to find ways to grow the overall value of what we have, including bringing things in that also includes high-grading the portfolio as we talked about. And the other thing we may not talk enough about, it also includes making sure that you execute the investments in the projects that you have well, that you bring them on budget, on schedule and that you run your existing base well. That is what we see as the objectives in terms of being able to grow that overall value. Sam Margolin : Thanks so much. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Neil. Thanks for taking the time. Neil Hansen : Hey, Neil. Neil Mehta : I guess, the first question I have is just around IMO 2020. We've seen \u2013 certainly seen a lot of other companies, including yourself point forward maintenance into 2019, so you can maximize the upside to IMO. So do you ultimately think that will cap the upside, that return of throughput as you go into 2020? And just any early thoughts from Exxon standpoint about how this playing out. Neil Hansen : Yes, I appreciate the question. I'll maybe step back a little bit and talk about what we're seeing. We mentioned in our prepared remarks. But you are starting to see certainly early transition with IMO on the product side. We've seen high sulfur fuel oil cracks, or significantly the clean/dirty spreads, I think recently we reached near 10-year highs. And so I think the market will be dynamic in the early stages of this transition, but certainly on the product side, you're already seeing some of that widening of that spread and the forward curves are indicating that as well. On the crude differentials, this difference between heavy-sour and light-sweet, we will also follow those same trends, right. I mean, low conversion refineries are going to be incentivized to run those sweet crudes, which will obviously widen out that spread and the futures curve is showing that. But again, we anticipate you'll see some choppiness, some volatility. There are a lot of variables at play here. It's a global market, but I don't think that we have any expectation that you wouldn't see those two key factors, that \u2013 widening of that clean/dirty spread, the widening of the heavy-sour and light-sweet. I don't \u2013 I think over time, the response to that will be the refining industry will have to add coking capacity. That's certainly something that we've done, I don't know if there is any level of maintenance that could be done that would minimize the impact of this. I think the market impact is too big to be able to respond to it with just pure maintenance. I think ultimately, the industry will have to add coking capacity, and that's why we feel really good about where we are, Neil. I mean, we've got more coking capacity than any of our peers, we've done the maintenance, we've added Antwerp. So we feel like we're very well positioned. Our conversion capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast is very high. I mentioned the coker in Europe, and we're also looking at upgrading resid in Singapore as well. So I think ultimately, that is what is going to have to be the response from industry. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Neil. And the follow-up is, one of your capabilities as a company is managing regulatory and political risk. As we go into the election season here in the United States, how do you think about risks around federal public lands and what that means for your exposure, and thinking about that in the context of New Mexico, Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico? Neil Hansen : Yes. Thanks, Neil. Appreciate the question. I think it's difficult to speculate on the impact of a policy without details on implementation. I think any effort obviously to ban fracking would have a negative impact on industry efforts to develop resources like the Permian. There is no doubt on that, but when you look at the motivation of those policies, I mean if the underlying concern is about risk of climate change and emissions reduction, we certainly share similar concerns. But we think they are more effective policies and we also think there are technology advances that are required. For example, we've been a very long-term vocal advocate of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. It's uniform it's transparent, it will incentivize the market to find solutions. I think any efforts to ban fracking or restrict supply will not remove demand for the resource. If anything, it will shift the economic benefit away from the U.S. to another country and potentially impact the price of that commodity here and globally. So we think there are better policies that policymakers can put in place, and we certainly spend a lot of time advocating for those policies. If it's a concern about responsible resource development, and \u2013 we share that same interest. We hold ourselves to a high standard, we work with regulators to improve industry standards, and we advocate for policies that will be effective in that space as well. I think when you think about political risk, one of the ways we approach that is working with policy makers to help them understand the policy decisions and help them understand the potential consequences of those. We've been in the business for a long time and I think with our experience in the industry, we have a good line of sight on what policies we think would be would be effective. The other thing we're trying to do Neil is, is help policymakers understand the tremendous benefits that resource development brings to economies, that brings to employment and to society. In fact, a recent study was done. I don't know if you saw this, but the development in the Permian, our development in the Permian Basin for New Mexico, will generate approximately $64 billion in economic benefits over the next 40 years. So I think helping policymakers understand what policies are more effective to address some of these concerns is important. And then I think also helping them recognize the economic benefit from responsible development of the resource. The other thing though, I think it highlights, there is political risk almost everywhere where we operate. And having a global portfolio like we have, helps us mitigate risk in any potential or specific jurisdiction. So I think \u2013 I certainly can understand if all your eggs are in one basket and we have a lot of political risk there, that there would be concern, but we feel like we can mitigate it with our portfolio, and then having this approach by working with policymakers. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Neil. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Neil. Operator : And next we'll go to Phil Gresh with J.P. Morgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning, Neil. Neil Hansen : Hey, good morning, Phil. How are you? Phil Gresh : Good. So first question, you were talking earlier about execution on the existing portfolio, an opportunity set. One of your peers today , just highlighted a 25% increase in capital spending cost at Tengiz, and obviously you are on that project. But just wondering how you view general inflation risks in \u2013 across the portfolio from a capital spending perspective. or would you characterize Tengiz as more of a one-off? Thank you. Neil Hansen : Yes. I appreciate the question, Phil. Look, I'd recommend any specific questions on project cost and schedule, it's more appropriate for those to be directed to Chevron as the operator. What I can say is, we certainly expect and I mentioned this on the call, we expect to meet our CapEx outlook for this year. This increase in Tengiz cost does put upward pressure on future capital programs \u2013 future-year capital programs. We're doing everything we can, working to accommodate that within our program and we will provide an update on where that stands at the Investor Day in March. I think you are talking about inflationary pressures, I think it's dependent on where you are operating. I think we've generally seen a fairly good cost environment in the deepwater. For example, in the Permian in the unconventional business, I think for the most part, we've seen a very good operating environment. We have seen a fairly hot market on the Gulf Coast, given all the capacity additions in the Chemical business on the refining side. And I think we foresee those cost pressures and we try and leverage our scale and our functional excellence to do everything we can to mitigate those cost pressures. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Maybe the most relevant one, on the U.S. Gulf Coast. If you look at the steam cracker that we're putting in place down near Corpus Christi, again, recognizing the cost pressures on the Gulf Coast, that influenced the location of that steam cracker. It also allowed us to leverage our capabilities globally. For example, one of the things we often do in the Upstream to avoid a high cost environment is you build modulars and lower cost locations, and then bring them to the site. We're doing the same thing with that steam cracker on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The result of that is that project would be 25% lower than the industry standard steam cracker. And so, I think you're always going to find different environments depending on where you operate, and I think we try to use our global procurement organization, our project expertise to make sure that we mitigate those costs. But it is something you have to watch very closely, because you can't undermine the value of any given investment if you're not executing well and not delivering it on time and on schedule. Phil Gresh : Okay, understood. Second question on Chemicals. Obviously, you've highlighted multiple times the macro pressures that you're seeing here. Some of your peers have been highlighting this as well. What's your latest thoughts as we look out into 2020 and considering the $200 million or so of earnings each of the past two quarters, there is \u2013 it looks like there is some higher maintenance in the next few quarters, but just generally, what's your kind of view of 2020 relative to the run rate of recent quarters? Thank you. Neil Hansen : I appreciate it, Phil. Yes, I think the \u2013 if you look at polyethylene industry margin, they are relatively steady versus the second quarter, but they absolutely remain weak due to industry supply length. And that has continued to be the issue. We don't expect that current market environment to improve certainly before the end of this year, but we are starting to see some competitors delay or cancel investment plans and that certainly could impact supply demand balances in 2020. And the other thing we're seeing that's important is that demand remains robust. And certainly, if you have delays in capacity additions and we continue to see strong demand growth, that could impact margins going forward 2020 plus. The other thing in a cyclical business, we try to focus on the long-term fundamentals, and in the Chemical business, they remain very strong. We expect growth to remain above GDP as the middle-class continues to grow. So that's certainly a key element of it and we focus on those long-term fundamentals. The other thing is, we recognize that in a cyclical business, in a commodity business, you win over the long term, with the lowest cost of supply. And so when we make these investments, I mentioned the steam cracker in Corpus Christi, we endeavor and do everything we can to keep those projects on the left hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that they are resilient to different price and margin environments. And that certainly is the case with our Chemical portfolio. The other thing we try to gain an advantage is on the product side. As \u2013 our sales growth for the most part is on high-performing products that have some sort of technology barrier, some sort of unique application for our customers. But we can garner a high margin and we can have a strong portfolio of those types of products. So again, I think we feel really good about it. The other thing I'd highlight, if you look at the recent investments that have come online, the steam cracker on the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont polyethylene expansion I just mentioned, those assets are performing really well. They're running above planned rates and they're accretive to earnings even in a challenging environment. So again, short term, certainly we continue to see pressures due to capacity additions, but long-term demand fundamentals remain strong and we feel like our portfolio is advantaged and well positioned to continue to perform well across the commodity price cycle. Phil Gresh : Right. Thanks Neil. Neil Hansen : Yes. Thank you, Phil. Operator : And now we'll go to Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you. Hi, Neil, Two questions. Neil Hansen : Jon? Jon Rigby : Hi. Couple of questions. The first on the Downstream. I mean, you referenced, I mean the improving crack spreads, light-heavy spreads for products that I guess would fit exactly into the kind of profile of the new projects that you brought on for the hydrofiner, the coker, the Rotterdam hydrocracker. And I'm a little surprised we're still not really seeing significant delta in earnings over and above the sort of more generic stuff you're highlighting in the 8-K. And I wondered is that just materiality or would \u2013 if was revisited at 4Q and looked at across 2019 versus 2018, would we start to see the effect of those start-ups within your earnings? And then maybe, if I ask a second question as well. Just on the guidance on disposal proceeds, is that a figure persisting that you will receive or is that growth of selling cost taxes, etc? Thank you. Neil Hansen : Yes. Thanks, Jon. Let me take the Downstream question first. You're absolutely right. This \u2013 when we make investments, when we consider how we want to transact within our portfolio, we remain very grounded in the long-term fundamentals. And the long-term fundamentals in the Downstream are that you will see a shift in demand away from products like fuel oil into distillates and to base stocks and into chemical feedstocks. So the investments we're making and have made, certainly Antwerp, Rotterdam are good examples, the Singapore resid upgrade project that I mentioned earlier, all of those are intended to capture the growth in that demand and improve the complexity of our refineries and the competitiveness of those refineries. We are absolutely investing to capture that long-term demand growth. Again, I \u2013 it's relatively early days in some of these major projects that have come online. They are performing well. They, obviously, have been in a different \u2013 in a lower-margin environment up to this point, but operationally, they're performing well which is impressive especially in some cases, like Rotterdam where that project was reliant on new technology, new catalyst technology that allows us to upgrade again, fuel oil into higher distillate project. So the fact that we've been able to execute their project well, execute it with new technology is pretty impressive and we feel very good about that. And we fully expect over time, especially if the margin environment improves, that we'll see significant contributions from those projects. I think beyond that \u2013 beyond the major projects, we continue to progress a lot of smaller capital projects at our refineries and we're constantly looking to optimize how we use those units. So again, I would fully anticipate as things progress, we will continue to see good progress and we will endeavor to try and highlight that more certainly in the earnings. In terms of the proceeds, the $15 billion objective we set out to 2021, that number is consideration. And so, to the extent we have divestments, transactions that include closing adjustments that would obviously reduce that number in terms of the actual cash flow that comes in. But the $15 billion is consideration. The other thing I'd remind you is that it was a risk number. So certainly in terms of the level of activity should we succeed and transacting on everything, it would bring in a lot more consideration than that $15 billion. It's progressing well. To be a $5 billion already, we feel good about the assets that are being marketed in terms of interest, and we expect to continue to put more assets in the market as we get close to the end of the year. Jon Rigby : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : And now we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Hi, guys. Good morning, and good morning everybody. Neil Hansen : Hey, Doug. Doug Leggate : Neil, I wonder if I could change tack, just a little bit and ask you what the latest update is at Groningen. Obviously, you highlighted the seasonal rebound in gas production or BOEs going into the fourth quarter. But obviously there's been a fair amount of news again in the last several months. And specifically, what I really want to get to target, if I may ask, is the make-whole provisions of the force majeure. So even though longer-term production may be curtailed earlier, what's happening to your \u2013 the net value and the net cash margin to Exxon as a consequence of that as we look longer-term? Neil Hansen : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate the question. Maybe just to give a little bit of background on what's happened in Groningen. So first of all, we certainly understand concerns of residents that have experienced earth tremors and the related damage, and if you go back about a little more than a year ago, we signed a Heads-of-Agreement with the Dutch government and Shell our partner and NAM that would accelerate the end of production I think by 2030, at the latest is the initial. That was the initial timeframe. There was another tremor that occurred in May of this year, and after that tremor, the Dutch government informed us of their intentions to bring production to zero by 2022. Now that change in the acceleration of the production we see as a significant departure from the Heads-of-Agreement that we signed roughly a year or so ago. So we, along with Shell in the state, have agreed for the need to put in place an addendum to that agreement, and we will work responsibly to accelerate the lowering of the production. And we think we will come to a final agreement on compensation. But that's something that's under way, Doug. I think what this highlights certainly is the advantage of having a global portfolio that provides you with a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility. Things are going to come in and out of the portfolio, but we anticipate certainly to be able to continue to grow the overall value of that portfolio. Just to give you some sense, I don't have specific, Doug, on earnings and cash, but the production levels are about 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day on an annual basis. It does depend heavily in any given quarter, on demand and weather conditions. But we don't anticipate any significant impact from this accelerated production in the fourth quarter, but we'll certainly work closely with all stakeholders to wind down production in accordance with the desires of the Dutch government. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the lengthy answer, Neil. My second one is probably a quick-one. Given your history and being able to answer these, but I just wonder if there is any update you can give on the Guyana project visibility? I mean clearly, you've got the Analyst Day coming up in March, but you've had extraordinary success again, and I'm specifically trying to see if you will give us any color on what you've learned so far on Ranger, because clearly that's a potential game changer, again, in terms of development timeline. And I'll leave with that. Thanks so much. Neil Hansen : All right, Doug. I'll try to exceed your expectations. So the news flow out of Guyana, as you know, continues to be extremely positive. And we talked about Phase 1 and the likelihood that we will have start-up by December. It's been a tremendous success. So I think it's a good reflection on the project management capabilities that we have as an organization to be able to deliver that on time and certainly ahead of schedule. Phase 2, well-defined FID, engineering construction is progressing well. And then we're working with the government on Phase 3, the Payara project, and expect to have early oil, first oil some time in 2023. So really good progress on those first three phases, we've said that by 2025, we would have at least five FPSOs and roughly 750,000 barrels a day of production. And if you think about where that could be, there are \u2013 certainly, you have the Payara area that we're focused on developing. You've got what we're calling the Eastern \u2013 South Eastern area, which includes all the discoveries we've had around that Turbot area, and I think there has been roughly five discoveries. And then if you move further East, you have Haimara and then West you have Hammerhead. So those are the possibilities, if you will, around potential fourth and fifth boats. We're still working to define those. I would anticipate sometime in the near future, being able to provide more clarity on where those next boats will be. One of the challenges that we have given all of the significant exploration success that we've had, is making sure that we take the time to optimize the development. We don't want to rush in a way where we do something we might regret down the future. So as we have all these new discoveries, we want to make sure we're optimizing the right approach to create value, not only for us, but also for all stakeholders involved. And then as you know, on top of that, it's all the undrilled potential. So we're trying to balance progressing those developments, while at the same time making sure that we progress what is becoming an even more attractive portfolio of exploration opportunities. Again, Doug, I would imagine, we will continue to provide clarity sometime in the next several months. On the Ranger, I don't have as much on Ranger only because we're still in the well location. I think quarrying operations have started. Again, I would expect we'll take those results and we'll be able to integrate them into what we know and the data that we have and we'll be able to provide an update in the future, but I hesitate to give anything, just because we're still on the well location. Doug Leggate : Neil, I appreciate the long answer. Just to be clear, you're still holding 750,000 in your 2025 targets as a company, right? Neil Hansen : That for production, yes, Doug, today that is the number we are still using. Again, that's production, that's not capacity of FPSO, that's production in 2025. Doug Leggate : Yes, I expect we will talk about it next week. Thanks a lot, Neil. I appreciate it. Neil Hansen : Thanks, Doug. Operator : All right. Next, we will go to Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And a few on your divestment plan. Just a couple on Norway and the assets sold. Could you say how much cash flow or free cash flow you're going to lose from selling those assets? And then also just a clarification, the $600 million tax repaid as part of the sale, is that paid by the buyer or is the repayment from the government? And then I also have a one follow-up, in addition to that. Thanks. Neil Hansen : Yeah. Good. Thanks Biraj. So really good progress with the divestment program with Norway. In terms of \u2013 I mean, you're thinking about to right in terms of the impact. Certainly there will be an impact to volumes and I think we said production in Norway is roughly 150,000 \u2013 currently 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. There will be an impact on earnings, cash flow, but also a reduction in CapEx, avoidance of CapEx. And so what we're planning to do, I think instead of providing specifics for every divestment that we do in terms of how that's affecting the overall portfolio, we're going to wait until March and we'll give a more fulsome view of all of the divestments and the impact that's going to have on the overall portfolio. On the cash, the cash refund is a repayment from the government, that $0.6 billion that you referenced. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay, that's very clear. And just a follow-up. Are you able to disclose what long-term oil and gas prices you used to test for impairments on your balance sheet? Neil Hansen : I think, like we do with anything \u2013 you're talking about impairments, is that what you said? Biraj Borkhataria : Impairment testing, yes. Neil Hansen : Okay. Sorry about that. Monitoring for impairments is something that is an ongoing process, and certainly is something that we follow very closely with U.S. GAAP. I don't think we disclose any specific pricing that we use in terms of conducting those impairments. We have very, as you would imagine, very stringent processes and controls to make sure we identify any changes and facts or circumstances that would indicate that an asset might not recover its carrying value. That includes annual planning and budgeting that we follow, it includes assessing trends and the underlying commodities, natural gas crude et cetera. And then certainly, if through those processes that we have, we determine that there is some question about asset recoverability and impairment might be required. But again, it\u2019s very strictly controlled certainly we follow U.S. GAAP very closely in doing that. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Thank you. Neil Hansen : You are welcome. Thank you, Biraj. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hey, good morning. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : On the Permian, can you tell us what's the rig number and the frac crew you are running right now. And also in the Delaware Basin, what percent of your position is in the federal land? Neil Hansen : Great. Thanks for the questions, Paul. In terms of rig and fracs, again, the pace of development continues along with the plans that we laid out. I think at the end of the quarter, Paul, we were at 55 rigs and 10 frac crews. So those are the numbers. Paul Cheng : Is that net number or just a gross number? Neil Hansen : No, I think it's a net number, Paul. Paul Cheng : Okay. Neil Hansen : Yes, in terms of the Delaware, I don't think I have the percentage of the lands that are federal in the Delaware. I mean, as you know, we have a very large inventory out there, but I don't have a specific number on federal lands. Paul Cheng : Is that something that you guys will be willing to share, and maybe then offline that you can have someone get back to me? Neil Hansen : Potentially, I mean, obviously, we would share with everyone, but I'll take it away, Paul and certainly and have a discussion whether or not that's something we want to share. Happy to do that. Paul Cheng : Okay. Second question. In your \u2013 you have a lot of coker and as you show in your presentation. Have you guys tried to run the high sulfur resid or the major component of that directly as a feedstock into your coker in this pacing heavy oil? If you have, and be able to do it, what is the quantity, maybe given the right economic, you will be able to run? Neil Hansen : Yes, thanks for the question, Paul. We have roughly 450,000 barrels a day of coking capacity. But we also have a lot of flexibility to fill the capacity and we can do that, certainly through heavy crude processing, we can do straight run, resid processing and we can do direct import of Vacuum Tower Bottoms and fuel oil. But in terms of how we feed that or we determine what goes into the cokers, we try to optimize the coker feed slate based on economics, based on availability and based on quality of the feedstocks. So we do have the capability. I think giving you a specific number wouldn't be helpful, because it will change depending on what's the appropriate \u2013 what's the most optimal crude slate to run or what the optimal slate to run through those cokers. But I will say I think \u2013 when you think about IMO 2020, the key economic drivers is likely to be crude oil differentials and our efforts to optimize the feed slate. And I think the general mechanism for that economic value will be the use of less expensive heavy-sour crudes. So we anticipate that's likely to keep the cokers full, providing advantage for us. But we certainly have the flexibility and capability to respond to the market and use any of those different kinds of feeds slates, but again, it's hard to give you a specific number, just because it depends on what the market is telling us. Paul Cheng : Then maybe let me ask you in another way. One of the major refined data set technology-wise that, yes, there is no problem that \u2013 to run it, but in certain \u2013 in many occasions, they are just being constrained by the logistic infrastructure arrangement. So I guess, my question to you is that in your coastal refinery, whether you its Baytown and all that, do you have the capability to receive large quantity of receipt if the economic is there? Neil Hansen : Yes, I really would agree with that. Certainly, technology-wise and capability-wise we can do it. I think it's fair to say, you can be limited by logistics. But we are, again, that would be part of the consideration of whether or not you use fuel oil in the coker. But again, it's somewhat limited, but I wouldn't say it's completely constrained. We do have the ability and have had the opportunity to run those in the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Europe. So there is flexibility there, there may be some constraints on logistics, but not enough to say you couldn't do it if the market told you that's the right thing to do. Paul Cheng : And final question, Corpus Christi crude export capacity. Neil, do you have a rough estimate what is the current export volume and how much in the near term we would be able to push it before the Southern Gateway Terminal stop? Neil Hansen : You are talking about export capacity of crude? Paul Cheng : Crude oil export capacity, yes, in Corpus Christi. With all the new pipeline from Permian going down, is there a concern that, that become a bottleneck and we couldn't export the oil? Neil Hansen : Yes. I certainly understand the concern. Obviously, as production continues to grow in the Permian, there is only so much of that, that will be consumed by industry on the Gulf Coast with manufacturing both refining and chemical capacity. But today, including us, we've been able to export crudes outside of the Gulf Coast into our refineries in Europe and Asia. Again, I don't know if there is any view on near-term constraints. I fully expect that as you see growth coming out of the Permian, that the industry will respond to that and I think is responding to that and building out additional export capacity, but I don't think we anticipate any near-term constraints on the ability to export out of Gulf Coast. So one of the things we have done, Paul, as you know, we're certainly investing to increase our capacity on the Gulf Coast to run more of the light crudes out of the Permian, including the Beaumont expansion that we're doing. And I think there's a few other smaller expansions at other refineries that we have to be able to run more of those light crudes. We're certainly able to take advantage of it in our facilities and export it out to our refineries, so no constraints currently. And again, we would anticipate the industry would continue to respond to the additional lines coming out of the Permian. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Neil Hansen : Thank you, Paul. Operator : All right. We'll next go to Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Dan Boyd : Hi, Neil. Good morning. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Dan. How are you? Dan Boyd : Doing well, thanks. I just wanted to kind of follow back on the Permian where you say you're kind of trending as according to plan. But you are at 10 frac crews and I think your plan was to go from 11 at the beginning of the year to 16 at an exit rate. So, are you seeing more efficiency on the frac crew side because your production is running ahead of plan? I'm just wondering what this signals? Are you going to be increasing completions going forward or are you able to just do more with less? Neil Hansen : I think \u2013 broadly and certainly for us, I think you are seeing more efficient production out in the Permian. And I think a fewer number of frac crews would be indicative of that. But I think even if you look at what's happening in industry rigs, certainly have flattened and even come down, but you see continued growth in volumes. And I think that's indicative of improved productivity, indicative of longer lateral lengths, indicative of using more and more effective rigs. So I think not only for us, but I think certainly in the industry, you're starting to see more, more efficiency. But at the same time, it's not a heterogeneous resource and I think that's where we bring advantages by being able to apply sophisticated reservoir modeling. We're able to, I think, optimize how we're developing optimize things like spacing. Our ability to understand the sub-surface allows us to tailor the development to our understanding of the geology. And so I think still relatively early, I think you're going to see us continue to learn. I think you're going to continue to see us optimize how we're approaching the development. So I wouldn't read too much into any specific number around frac crews or rigs. Again it isn't about volume for us. This is about what we need to do to create value for our shareholder and so we're going to respond to what we're learning, we're going to respond to the application of technology and drilling expertise and project management capabilities to make sure that over time, we're achieving that objective of creating value. Dan Boyd : Okay, thanks. And then we talked about this one before, but we now look at your operating cash flow year-to-date versus the plan back in March. You may be running about, call it, $12 billion to $14 billion shy of that. Obviously we've been in a tough macro environment, but I was wondering, can you help us understand how much of that shortfall versus plan is purely related to price, and how much is potentially related to operations. We talked about increased maintenance, because what I'm trying to figure out here is, is there are potential for the next couple of quarters to get back on track and is there an operational catch-up that we might see? Neil Hansen : Yes. I appreciate the question. We're obviously in a much different market environment than the basis that we use for that Investor Day, especially in Downstream and Chemical. So when we look at how we're performing relative to those numbers, if you adjust for that impact, if you adjust for the fact that we're in a very different environment, we're generally pleased with where we are. We have had as you highlighted, some operational challenges, which have been a detriment to that. But broadly speaking, we feel very pleased if you were to adjust for that environment. Maybe more importantly, Dan, as we continue to have tremendous success on operational milestones. And we highlighted the liquids growth reaching 10 FIDs this year alone, the additional exploration discoveries. So we feel really good about the progress we're making on the underlying investments that will grow the earnings and cash flow generation capacity of the organization over time. So, I think again, for the most part, we feel pretty good both on earnings and cash flow with the exception that we're just \u2013 we happen to be in a different environment. But we fully anticipate given that we are investing with structural advantages, we're not relying on market help that over time, those will begin to manifest themselves as we get into different price and margin environments. Dan Boyd : All right. Thanks for taking the questions. Neil Hansen : Thanks Dan. Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Great. We'll take that question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yes, hey. Thanks for taking the question here, past the hour. I wanted to address the Mosaic agreement. It wasn't really discussed on the call yet. I mean, you guys have talking \u2013 have talked about carbon capture for a little while now. And there is obviously concern in the journal investment community that all the resource you own, will not be able to be developed, because of concerns around greenhouse gas. So your ability to develop a breakthrough technology, I think would go a long way. Can you just discuss the prospects of that technology and kind of where do you see that impacting the business, and maybe the carbon emission profile? And I have a quick follow-up. Thanks. Neil Hansen : Jason, that's a good question to end the call on. Look \u2013 I mean, let me be clear. First of all, we recognize the risks from climate change and we recognize that something has to be done about it. And we are committed to providing affordable reliable energy, while minimizing the impact on the environment, and that's specifically the need to reduce CO2 emissions. If you look at that, 90% of global energy emissions come from three sectors, comes from power generation, transportation and the industrial sector. And the challenge that we face is, finding a comprehensive set of solutions that will allow us to reduce the emissions in those three sectors. But it's going to require advances in technology and it's going to require the implementation of effective policies by government. So if you look at where we think we can participate in that solution development, is through our advantaged research and development capabilities. And so we are attacking each of those three sectors. So in power generation, you mentioned carbon capturing technology that is going to be critical to help reduce emissions in power generation. We're doing not only internal research and development, but we are also expanding the portfolio outside the company. You mentioned Mosaic. We had a similar agreement with a company called Global Thermostat few months ago. I mentioned all the partnerships we have with universities, national labs, et cetera. So we have a very wide aperture looking for opportunities to develop scalable economic solutions on carbon capture. The second sector transportation, everyone's aware of the advances being made on the light-duty side, but on the commercial transportation, heavy-duty aviation, we think we need a biofuel solution. And you are, I'm sure, very familiar with our algae program. We're also looking at cellulosic biofuels. And then on the industrial side, that sector we're looking at new plant configurations, new processes, new catalysts. So the way we want to participate, the way we are participating in this, at a level that is much more significant than any of our peers, is leveraging our technology capabilities to come up with those solutions. And I think we've spent $10 billion on low-emission technologies I think since the year 2000. And then as I mentioned, we continue to advocate for policies. So again, that's why you're seeing us partner with companies like Mosaic, Global Thermostat, because we recognize where those solution gaps exist and we believe new technologies are needed, and we think we have a competitive advantage to participate and find those solutions, while at the same time continuing to create value for our shareholders. Jason Gabelman : Thanks, I appreciate that answer. If I could just squeeze in a very quick follow-up, you cited the $150 million benefit to Downstream on the clean/dirty spread. Is there a corresponding impact on the Upstream, just trying to understand the impact to the entire portfolio? Thanks. Neil Hansen : I appreciate that last question, Jason. It's something we looked at. I mean, obviously we don't want to focus just on the benefit we're getting from the Downstream. So when we look at our Upstream portfolio, this is a good example of having a very large global diverse portfolio, and there will be pluses and minuses in that portfolio as it relates to the implementation of IMO. But when we looked at it, in the end it ended up being a neutral impact. So it really does not have an impact on our Upstream. Again, like I mentioned, you'll see pluses and minuses, but on the overall portfolio, there is a neutral impact. Neil Hansen : Well, we appreciate everyone allowing us the opportunity to highlight the third quarter and all of the key milestones that we hit, and the continued progress on our portfolio. We look forward to your participation on our fourth quarter earnings call, where I will be joined by our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods. And we appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you everyone again for their participation.",

And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Neil Hansen. Please go ahead, sir. Neil Hansen : All right. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. This is Neil Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO, Darren Woods.  After I cover the quarterly and full year financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives selecting on 2019 and the year ahead. Following Darren\u2019s remarks, I'll be glad to address specifics on the reported results, while Darren will be available to take your questions on broader themes, including strategic priorities, progress on major growth projects, and views on market fundamentals.  Our comments this morning will reference to slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I\u2019ll now highlight fourth quarter financial performance starting on Slide 3. Earnings were $5.7 billion in the quarter or $1.33 per share including a positive $0.92 per share impact from the Norway divestment and a one-time tax item.  Results were in line with expectations taking into account the challenging price and margin environment we have previously communicated. Liquids realizations were essentially flat, while Refining and Chemical margins weakened significantly in the quarter. The broader margin environment remained challenging as short-term supply and demand imbalances continued to pressure natural gas prices and moved base stock margins despite modest improvement in the fourth quarter.  Cash flow from operations in asset sales was $9.4 billion in the quarter after adjusting for changes in working capital, cash flow from operations and asset sales was $11.1 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $8.5 billion and $31.1 billion for the full year, slightly ahead of the previous projection of $30 billion with better than expected pace on the Beaumont light crude expansion and Baton Rouge polypropylene projects.  And of course, the early startup of Liza Phase 1 in Guyana. Full year PP&E adds and net investments and advances, a proxy for cash CapEx was $26.8 billion. I\u2019ll now provide a more detailed view of developments since the third quarter on the next slide. In the Upstream, liquids realizations were essentially flat, while gas realizations improved slightly. Production was in line with expectations with higher seasonal gas demand in Europe.  Liza Phase 1 achieved first oil ahead of schedule at just under five years from discovery, which is significantly ahead of the industry average of nine years.  We also announced the 15th and 16th exploration discoveries with the Mako and Uaru wells offshore Guyana. We closed the sale of our Norway non-operated assets during the quarter highlighting good progress today on our $15 billion investment program.  In the Downstream, refining fuels margins decreased during the quarter consistent with seasonal demand. In addition, weaker high sulfur fuel oil pricing did not fully reflect in crude spreads. As a result, low and medium conversion refinery margins weakened more than high conversion refinery margins. This had a notable impact on our Downstream results outside of the United States. And this demonstrates the importance of strategic investments like the recently sanctioned resid upgrade project at a refinery in Singapore which will greatly improve conversion complexity. Reliability in the Downstream improved in the quarter, largely offsetting higher scheduled maintenance.  Although long-term fundamentals remains strong in the Chemical business, polyethylene margins continued to be impacted by supply lengths from industry capacity additions and in the fourth quarter, higher naphtha feed costs.  With approximately 25% of our polyethylene portfolio produced from liquids feeds like naphtha, this had a significant impact on our Chemical business line results. On the project side, the recently completed Beaumont polyethylene expansion is running well and producing at 5% above design rates. As part of our collaborative efforts to develop and deploy lower emissions technologies, we signed a two-year expanded joint development agreement with FuelCell Energy to optimize carbonate fuel cell technology for large-scale carbon capture, and we extended our support of the MIT Energy Initiatives, low carbon research and education mission by renewing as a Founding Member for another five years. Let\u2019s move to Slide 5 for an overview of fourth quarter earnings relative to the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings of $5.7 billion were up $2.5 billion from the third quarter. Upstream earnings increased by approximately $4 billion driven by the gain on the Norway divestment, a favorable one-time tax item, higher volumes and improved gas realizations.  Downstream earnings decreased by $330 million, due to lower margins, and higher scheduled maintenance, partly offset by improved reliability and favorable year-end inventory impacts. Also included in the Downstream results was a sequential $450 million negative mark-to-market impact on derivative positions, essentially offsetting the inventory effects. Chemical earnings decreased by $600 million driven by weaker margins, and higher expenses supporting growth projects.  Finally, Corp and Fin earnings decreased by approximately $500 million due to the absence of a favorable, one-time tax item in the third quarter.  Moving to Slide 6, full year earnings of $14.3 billion were down $6.5 billion from 2018. Upstream earnings increased by $360 million, driven by the Norway divestment and higher liquids volumes. It was partly offset by lower realizations and expenses supporting growth.  Downstream earnings decreased by $3.7 billion, due to more narrow North American differentials, lower refining margins, higher scheduled maintenance and the absence of the Germany retail and Augusta divestments in 2018. And again here, included in the year-over-year results was a negative $420 million mark-to-market impact on derivative positions offsetting any benefits from the inventory effects. Chemical earnings decreased by $2.8 billion driven by weaker margins, higher expenses supporting growth and the absence of a one-time tax item.  I\u2019ll now provide more insight into the challenging 2019 price and margin environment on Slide 7. As shown here in the top left chart, cyclically low prices and margins across our business lines accounted for a year-over-year earnings decrease of $7.5 billion. All other earnings drivers netted out to a positive impact of $1 billion.  The chart at the bottom left of the page provides a view of commodity prices and margins over the past ten years and the relative position of the environment we\u2019ve seen in 2019 and 2018. Now as we note here, the fourth quarter saw further deterioration in prices and margins, especially Chemical margins with the increase in liquid feed costs.  While margins weakened from 2018 and remain on the low end of the 10 year range across many of our business lines, it\u2019s important to note these levels are generally consistent with the scenarios we use to test our investment decisions. Despite the challenging margin environment, long-term demand fundamentals remained strong. In fact, growth in demand in 2019 for Upstream liquids and natural gas, distillate products, and polyethylene was at the higher end of the compound annual growth rates experienced over the past ten years.  While making investment decisions based on long-term fundamentals is challenging, when near-term prices and margins are under pressure, it provides us with the opportunity to leverage our competitive advantages including significant financial capacity. It allows us to benefit from the favorable environment that occurs when others pull back and the cost of investing declines.  I\u2019ll now spend some time looking at the full year performance of each of our businesses in more detail starting with the Upstream. Volumes grew by 119,000 oil equivalent barrels per day with liquids growth of 5% driven by Permian, Hebron and Kaombo.  Efforts to high grade our portfolio also resulted in gains on asset sales, primarily from the Norway divestments. And as indicated previously, liquids and gas realizations also impacted earnings with declines of 8% and 17% respectively.  In the Downstream, more narrow North American crude differentials and lower margins reduced earnings by $3 billion. The change in differentials shown on the upper left chart accounted for $1.7 billion of that year-over-year decrease. Full year industry margins were 19% lower than 2018, pressured by new industry capacity additions that exceeded demand growth by 800,000 barrels a day and you can see that on the bottom left chart.  Regarding IMO, we continue to see clean/dirty product spread expand in the fourth quarter. However, light-sweet, and heavy-sour crude differentials have been slow to respond with lower global supply of sour crudes. Strong global refining runs coming out of forward maintenance and the previously mentioned industry capacity additions.  The chart on the upper left of this page shows medium heavy-sour crude discounts relative to Brent through 2019. While the spread has expanded recently, crude discounts are not at parity with high sulfur fuel oil prices. The marine fuel supply chain fundamentals are still transitioning. Feed and product pricing have not reached equilibrium placing pressure on low to medium conversion margins.  Now, we would expect this to result in fewer heavy-sour crude rents, ultimately leading to higher discounts and market parity. As we highlighted several times over the past years scheduled maintenance in the Downstream was higher than normal impart due to preparation for IMO. In fact, 2019 represented the highest level of scheduled maintenance for the Downstream in the past 15 years. This activity level decreased earnings by $700 million relative to 2018.  As shown on the bottom left chart, we expect 2020 scheduled maintenance to be more typical in line with our historical average.  Moving to Slide 11, I\u2019ll provide more perspective on the Chemical margin environment and its impact on earnings. Our Chemical portfolio is positioned well to take advantage of low cost feed and energy cost with over half of our polyethylene capacity in North America. This is balanced with our production footprint in Asia Pacific, which positions us near key growth markets.  However, the current margin environment remains challenged with excess industry capacity despite demand growth of 4% per year since 2016. Now relative to 2018, lower margins reduced Chemical margins by $1.8 billion.  In the fourth quarter, polyethylene margins were further impacted by tighter feed supply resulting in a 65% increase in the cost to produce ethylene from naphtha. Key industry price spreads shown on the bottom left of the chart declined by 40% on average for the year. Given our product mix, this is important. Since these changes impacted approximately 60% of our production.  Now the significance of these market factors will obviously vary across the industry depending on product mix. Growth-related expenses, unfavorable foreign exchange and the absence of a one-time tax item also decreased Chemical earnings by approximately $700 million.  I\u2019ll now provide a more detailed overview of the fourth quarter cash profile shown on Slide 12. Fourth quarter earnings, when adjusted for depreciation expense and changes in working capital yielded $6.4 billion in cash flow from operating activities. The $4.3 billion impact from working capital and other related to non-cash adjustments for the gain on the Norway divestment.  Fourth quarter proceeds from asset sales of $3.1 billion, primarily reflects the cash received for the Norway asset sales. Fourth quarter additions to PP&E and net investments and advances were $7.4 billion. Gross debt was largely unchanged and cash ended the quarter at $3.1 billion. And with that, I will turn the call over Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Neil. Good morning everyone. It\u2019s great to be on the call with you today. Let me start by sharing my perspective on last year beginning with margins. There is no doubt that 2019 was a challenging year for a number of our businesses.  And I think Neil\u2019s chart made that point near or at 10 year lows on prices and margins for Gas, Refining and Chemicals. Fourth quarter was particularly challenging for our Chemical business. Of course, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s driving us and the implications for our businesses and our investment plans.  As Neil said, and I\u2019ll show you later, the product demand underpinned our investments in each of these sectors remained solid. Depressed margins are driven by excess capacity, which will be a short-term impact particularly if industry pulls investments back significantly, which, by the way we are beginning to see.  We know demand will continue to grow driven by rising population, economic growth and higher standards of living. We know that excess capacity will shrink, typically faster than people think and margins will rise, then, new capacity will be needed. These are the classic price cycles of capital-intensive commodity industries. We believe strongly that investing in the trough of this cycle has some real advantages. As industries pull back, project costs come down, resulting in lower cost capacity additions, they are then available to catch the cycle upswing. This is a win-win, capturing high margins at a low \u2013 lower cost.  The downside of course is to grow on cash, which we are seeing and responding to. Our organization is very focused on driving further efficiencies and looking for opportunities to optimize and/or pace our investment portfolio, while preserving value and we reducing the draw. Our new projects organization in Upstream business lines are giving us a good line of sight on the best options to grow value efficiently. And as I said before, we have an important advantage, because of our large opportunity set, it gives us optionality in these volatile markets. We also have a very healthy balance sheet, which was built for times like this, giving us a significant advantage in maximizing medium to long-term value.  So while we would prefer higher prices and margins, we don\u2019t want to waste the opportunity that this low price environment provides, which leads me to our 2019 performance.  Our portfolio of integrated businesses helped in facing the short-term headwinds, generating $14 billion in earnings. If you normalize our 2019 results for the industry\u2019s price and margin environment and look at them on the same basis we used last March at our Investor Day, earnings were in line with the potential we communicated. Obviously, this is a theoretical exercise, but a very important one. We can\u2019t control the short-term price environment, stripping out the market impacts, allows us to judge the underlying progress we are making in building a stronger business based on the longer fundamentals. This is absolutely essential for a long cycle capital-intensive business.  In the mean time, the lower price environment puts additional focus on driving efficiencies in both capital outlays and operating cost. It also drives us to ensure the schedule and mix of our capital expenditures are optimized. This is something our organization is very focused on.  In 2019, we made good progress in upgrading and focusing our asset portfolio with the divestment of our Upstream Norway OBO business. We are on tracks with the plans that we outlined last March with a number of additional assets in the market.  However, I want to emphasize that this is a value play. We are high grading our portfolio as higher quality opportunities come into our portfolio, we evaluate other assets for long-term strategic fit moving asset out, we have to find a buyer who can realize more value than we can. Otherwise, there is no space for a deal and we won\u2019t transact.  We remain very excited by our investment opportunities, even in the price environment we saw last year, our investments would perform. It reinforces our capital investment strategy, which is invest in the long-term fundamentals with test against short-term lows.  We made good progress on our projects in 2019 and used our financial capacity to mitigate the price environment resulting in a year-end leverage of 13%, a level we felt very comfortable with.  We increased production by $119,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, a 3% increase over 2019 \u2013 2018. Nearly, all of this is attributable to the success we had in growing liquids, which increased by a 120,000 barrels per day or 5% relative to 2018. Continued ramp up in the Permian Basin was a significant driver of this growth.  We continue to like what we are seeing in our Permian development. The organization is making very good progress on maximizing resource recovery, efficiently deploying capital and optimizing production.  In addition, we are making good progress on our Logistics, Refinery and Chemical investments that leverage Permian production, giving us greater value through an integrated approach with the whole exceeded to some of the parts. We had another good year exploring with six major deepwater discoveries, five in Guyana and one in Cyprus.  Guyana discoveries resulted in a 2 billion barrel increase in estimated recoverable resources, which now exceeds 8 billion oil equivalent barrels. In fact, we had four of the top 10 discoveries in the world and five out of the six largest oil discoveries. In recognition of this success, for the second year running, Exxon Mobil was named Explorer of The Year.  We\u2019ve also made progress in our work to develop new lower emissions technologies to help address the risk of climate change. While renewable like wind and solar play an important role, they don\u2019t solve the emissions challenge for every market, geography or application. Deciding these new technologies that will reduce emissions, while meeting the growing demand for affordable and reliable energy. We are leveraging our research organization to help develop them. In 2019, we signed or extended eight agreements with a variety of companies and institutions to expand research into lower emissions technologies.  This adds to the more than 80 collaborations we have in place across academia, national labs and energy centers to scale up advanced biofuels, carbon capture technology, and less energy-intensive manufacturing processes. These efforts address sectors that account for 80% of emissions, commercial transportation, power generation and industrial. In summary, looking at the year in total, I am pleased with the progress we have made, particularly in light of the challenging market conditions.  Almost two years ago, we outlined a plan to grow the value of our corporation, robust to the price cycles inherent in our industry. Two years down the road, we are delivering on those plans doing what we said we would.  With the increased supply and corresponding drop in margins, we\u2019ve increased our focus on efficiencies, while we continue to optimize our investment portfolio, again, taking advantage of the optionality that comes with a large number of opportunities, which I\u2019d like to turn to next. In the Upstream, I\u2019ve already mentioned our success in Guyana, which I\u2019ll come back to in a few moments. Development of our deepwater portfolio in Brazil, another key asset remains on track with exploration activities planned over the next couple of years to better quantify this high potential resource. We are also making good progress in the Permian, which I\u2019ll talk more about when we get to a slide later in the deck.  In the Downstream, three of our major projects are online and contributing to earnings and cash flow even in last year\u2019s challenging market. These projects position us well for the growth in demand of higher-value distillates and lubricant-based stocks. The remaining projects in our Downstream portfolio progressed consistent with our plans.  These projects have all been tested against the margin environment we saw in 2019 and all would be earnings and cash accretive.  In our Chemical business, eight of our 13 growth facilities are online and we reached final investment decisions on another four last year, which again remain attractive even when tested against the 2019 market environment.  Across the board, we remain extremely confident in the value of our project portfolio. Each project leverages our competitive advantages and is underpinned by growing demand, which is shown on the next chart. Demand fundamentals remain strong, supported by a growing population, economic expansion and higher standards of living.  You can see these fundamentals reflected in historical growth in demand for the energy and products that we provide including demand growth in 2019. Of course, growing demand is only part of the equation. In our business, large capacity additions can come online in overwhelmed growth in demand in the short-term which pushes margins down.  That\u2019s the story of 2019 and it\u2019s built into the planning basis for our projects. Our investment strategy builds on long-term fundamentals, leverages our competitive advantages and delivers projects robust to down cycles. This will structurally improve Exxon Mobil\u2019s capacity to generate earnings and cash flow, which we laid out at last year\u2019s Investor Day.  This approach has resulted on our most attractive investment portfolio since the merger 20 years ago. This also generated a portfolio with an average return of 20%. We\u2019ve seen no market developments over the course of 2019 that have changed this. However, we are using the 2019 price environment to challenge ourselves to further optimize the portfolio and drive greater efficiencies. But we expect to benefit from this effort. It hasn\u2019t led us to change our 2020 CapEx guidance. Our projects remain advantaged and the economics are robust industry price cycles.  Let me use our most recent startups to demonstrate this starting in the Downstream and Chemical. Leveraging the capabilities of our organization, our scale and our technology are essential in developing industry-leading projects. But the benefits are only realized when executed efficiently, another Exxon Mobil strength.  You may recall that we shared a version of the chart on the left during our Investor Day. The grey area represents our estimate of the net cash margin for every refinery in the world at 2019 prices. The blue line represents our Rotterdam refiner prior to our recent investment. Second line represents the yield improvement we executed with the first ever deployment of the processing catalyst that we developed. This final line is what we actually realized after a year of run time, no different than what we\u2019ve planned.  Now, this would be expected for an industry standard proven technology. However, it\u2019s a significant accomplishment for a new to the world technology, one that\u2019s significantly improved Rotterdam\u2019s earnings last year.  This next line shows the Antwerp margin before our coker investment. Next, we show the expected margin improvement assumed in the project basis. Finally, the actual margin improvement. As you can see, the project is performing better than expected in a very low margin environment.  The Beaumont polyethylene expansion started up ahead of schedule and it\u2019s exceeding design rates by 5%, while the new Baytown steam cracker and polyethylene lines are operating 10% above design rates.  Combined, these projects contributed over $600 million in 2019\u2019s very low margin environment. The markets recover, their contributions will be even more significant. Bottom-line of this chart, we delivered these investments in line with our commitments. They are meeting or exceeding expectations and they are adding value in extremely challenging market conditions.  Let me turn to the Upstream in Guyana. Reaching first oil Guyana was a major achievement for all stakeholders and it is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication by the people of Guyana and our project team. First oil was achieved ahead of schedule, but five years faster than the average timeline for the industry and at an industry-leading development cost.  Liza phase 1 will continue to ramp up production to 120,000 barrels a day over the next couple of months, while Liza phase 2 is progressing well with the startup in early 2022 in line with our commitments and at the leading edge of industry.  Chart on the left provides a perspective on industry cost and schedule. We are continuing to work with the government towards FID at Phase 3 Payara, with its targeted startup in 2023. Looking more broadly, as I have already mentioned, we\u2019ve increased the estimated recoverable resource from the Stabroek Block to more than 8 billion barrels, an increase of 2 billion oil equivalent barrels. We\u2019ve now had 16 successful wells out of 18 drilled including our recently announced discoveries at Mako and Uaru. Resource size across these 16 successful wells equates to an average of more than 500 million barrels per discovery or the equivalent of a giant for each discovery.  We recently brought in a fourth drill ship to the basin and are making plans for a fifth. Significant potential remains beyond the first few phases as we move to test Kaieteur and Canje Blocks to the north and east to Stabroek.  Increasing the scope of our exploration activity, and development and appraisal drilling when costs are low relative to recent years enables us to increase the value of this substantial resource, which is good news for the country, for the investors. Let me turn now to another major growth play, our integrated Permian development, which made significant progress in 2019, again in line with our commitments. Let me start by saying that we are still in the relatively early days of this development, particularly in the Delaware Basin. For perspective, we\u2019ve developed roughly 20% of our resource in the Midland and only around 3% of our resource in the Delaware.  We are continuing to learn as we delineate and develop this resource. Having said this, we are making very good progress. Production for the year increased by 120,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or nearly 80% relative to 2018. As we\u2019ve said previously, our development program is driven by balancing production rates, resource recovery and capital efficiency to maximize value.  We are seeing continued improvements in drilling and completions, significantly improving cost, while our Delaware well performance is at the leading edge of industry. We are continuously optimizing our cube development drilling and our subsurface technology is enabling us to tailor well spacing which is resulting in higher production, improved recovery and capital efficiencies.  Last year, we made considerable investments in aboveground compression, separation in logistics infrastructure. This not only supports the current drilling program which is building cost-efficient infrastructure for future drilling. This follows the comprehensive development plan that we laid out last March and captures the capital efficiency of scale of development.  I noted Neil Chapman and his team are excited by the potential and are looking forward to discussing the magnitude of the improvements we're seeing at our upcoming Investor Day. I do want to touch briefly on our expectations for 2020, though again, we will have more detail in March.  As I mentioned before, Our Guyana Phase 1 ramp up and Phase 2 construction will continue and we will broaden our exploration efforts as we work through the considerable, undrilled potential in the basin with five additional wells planned. We expect to make considerable progress in the Permian with the completion of the Cowboy Center delivery point, execution of the first large-scale cube development, and volumes growth of 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by year-end.  We are anticipating FID for the next wave of our major growth projects including Guyana Phase 3 in Brazil. We are also planning for significant exploration activity over the next two years in Brazil. We began to test the tremendous potential of our acreage position.  In the Downstream, our recent project startups will capitalize on the margin uplift associated with higher value products and coming off of a year of significant scheduled maintenance, we expect higher refinery utilization in 2020. In the Chemical business, we will continue to grow sales of performance products and even with the near-term margin pressures, we expect our recent project startups will continue to deliver earnings and generate positive cash.  Across the corporation, we will maintain a sharp focus on improving our base businesses, driving efficiencies and optimizing the value of our investment portfolio. We will continue to actively market less strategic assets in an effort to high grade our portfolio through value accretive divestments. And of course, we will continue to leverage the key competitive advantage of our financial capacity, capture industry-leading value across the price cycles.  Given the attractiveness of our organic investment opportunities, this was an important advantage last year. As you can in this chart, as the margins in the Downstream and Chemical business dropped to historic lows, we utilized our financial capacity to fund projects that improved our competitiveness positioned us to capture the eventual upswing.  With this, our leverage increased slightly during the year, but remains well below our peer group in the broader energy sector. To give you a sense of our scale advantage, 1% of incremental leverage equates to about $4 billion in additional debt.  While our financial capacity is an important advantage, it\u2019s one we use very thoughtfully, given the volatility of our industry and the opportunity to come with it, we strive to maintain a significant buffer to preserve optionality.  Now before I hand it back to Neil, I\u2019ll offer a few closing thoughts. As we\u2019ve demonstrated over the past two years, we are committed to delivering on our investment plans and high grading our asset portfolio to strengthen the earnings and cash generation of our business across the broad range of price environments. We have a very rich set of investment opportunities and as we work to develop these opportunities, we remain focused on optimizing total value over the long-term.  2019 price and margin environment, we have increased our efforts to drive further capital efficiency and optimize pace without compromising value. We will remain thoughtful in utilizing our financial capacity, but we will take full advantage of it to capture value-accretive opportunities without compromising our flexibility.  Finally, we will continue to focus on improving our base business and driving efficiencies across the entire corporation. With that, I will hand things back to Neil. Neil Hansen : Okay. Thank you for your comments, Darren. We will now be happy to take any questions you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  We will take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, and Darren, again we appreciate you jump on the call and doing these with us. So, I guess, my first question is around, the capital spend and so, I think what you are signaling is capital spend in line with the prior guidance, which if I remember was $33 billion to $35 billion.  And can you just talk about the framework if the environment stays challenging especially across Downstream and Gas. Is there downward flex on that spend? Or is the Exxon framework that you spend through the cycle with the long-term orientation? Darren Woods : So, good morning, Neil and thanks for your comments. Yes, so as I said, we at we have with the price environment and cash the draw really taken advantage of some of the organizational changes that we made last year. We formed a corporate-wide projects organization bringing together the experience and capability in that space into one organization that can then be deployed across our of the entire asset portfolio.  The Upstream reorganization has given us a real good line of sight across the businesses, one that wasn't as clear in the past with the functional organization. So we're using those changes to take a real hard look at the opportunities we got. Of course the Chemicals and Downstream business is doing the same thing in looking for additional efficiencies to shape that portfolio.  We are also looking at options to pace and to move projects around and out if we can do that without compromising the long-term value that we built those projects on the basis that we built those projects on. So, I think there is opportunity in that space. And if we continue to see very low margins and cash for all that we want to address, we got optionality to do that.  We can move some things out and we can also slow down the pace in the Permian. We don't want to compromise the scale of the development in the Permian. So we are \u2013 there is a balance to be struck there. But we\u2019ve got optionality and I think, as we go through the year to come, we will keep a real close eye on kind of how the market develops and then keep a hand on the lever to make sure that we make adjustments as we need to.  I think it\u2019s one of the great advantages of having a very large portfolio. We\u2019ve got lots of optionality here. And so, I think we are comfortable with it and the one criteria is that we won't \u2013 we may defer some value capture. But we are not going to - we don't want to eliminate or pass up any value capture. Neil Mehta : That\u2019s very clear. And then just a follow-up on your comments on the Permian. We\u2019re looking at the red line versus sort that the green bars if you will on the Permian slide and it\u2019s hard to extrapolate how much quarter-to-quarter. But the production was a little bit more flat Q4 versus Q3. Is that just the timing of completions associated with the cube design?  And should we expect that acceleration at some point earlier this year? And then just how do you think about Midland versus Delaware? I think one of the comments that was made on those conference calls a couple of quarters ago was that, Midland has gone really well, but Delaware is not performing as well as you would like on the drilling side. So any color there would be helpful. Darren Woods : Yes, I think with respect to the first points you made around, difficult to extrapolating for any one quarter is exactly right. I think when we introduced that end and Neil Chapman talked about it. We said it wasn't going to be a smooth development and that we would see a lumpy progress with respect to the volume\u2019s growth. So I don't - I would draw whole lot. We\u2019re not - we haven't seen anything in that development which would suggest anything other than continuing on that path. But again, it will be lumpy and I think if you look back at that red line, you'll see that lumpiness has been playing out historically. So, and I think you see that we continue to go forward. I think, a really important point, if you look at the volumes that we delivered in the Permian, we\u2019re above what we said we were going to do last year at the Investor Day by about 20,000 barrels a day. So, that's clearly on track. With respect to the Permian and the Delaware, of course as I said the Delaware is much earlier in its development cycle. The organization continues to learn as we\u2019re going through that development. I would tell you, we are making really good progress in what we\u2019re seeing there. Neil did talk about Delaware being more difficult than the Midland.  But I would also say, again, another advantage of the reorganization that we did last year in bringing kind of the best of Exxon Mobil with the best of our XTO organization into this space is that we\u2019re making really, really good progress with respect to that. And like what we\u2019re seeing and as I said, I tell it to guys and you are real \u2013 we are excited by the potential here.  And I know they're anxious to spend some time in March taking you through some of the proof points of that. But I would tell you, we like what we are seeing in the Delaware and while it is different than the Midland nothing to suggest that that the opportunity there is not as great, if not better frankly. Neil Mehta : Thanks very much, Darren, Darren Woods : Sure, Neil. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you Neil and Darren. I just wanted to go to \u2013 I think, the fourth bullet point on your key message. You do flagged up driving efficiencies and improving the base business and although I think a lot of the focus does fall on your investment program, I mean, you need to fund it and it seems to me the evidence that there may have been some shortfalls in generating the earnings and cash in the base business to fund that investment.  Is that a fair observation? It\u2019s difficult to disaggregate underlying performance from the cyclical conditions, but are you able to sort of identify where there have been some unexpected shortfalls? And whether there are business improvement plans, et cetera to go after changing that into 2020? Darren Woods : Yes. Thank you, Jon. Good morning. Just on that with respect to the shortfalls, as I said in my prepared comments, it's really a function of the margin environment that we\u2019ve seen out there and the sectors that we've invested in terms of our production capacity and the configuration of that capacity.  As you look around different the Chemical businesses and Downstream businesses, what you typically see quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year and the big drivers of change in movement is how the margins vary and impact each of the configurations in the investment.  So, as an example, as Neil Hansen mentioned, we have liquids cracking in the Chemical business in the quarter of the charts that he showed that was clearly had - clearly had an impact on the quarter. And so there is a lot of structural change and so we look across the businesses that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re seeing is the spreads that have changed across both Chemical and Downstream business given our configuration has impacted us.  That doesn\u2019t worry us particularly. In fact, if you go back in time and Chemical that configuration was very attractive and made us really good money over a number of years. We've had some significant investments in that space here recently, which has created this imbalance in supply and demand. But the business is growing fast and we will come out of that. And so, we expect to see the Chemical business and our base business return to where it was in the past as that the demand growth continues and that excess supply capacity is coming down. Don\u2019t forget too in the Downstream, significant turnaround here last year. As Neil said, highest level of turnarounds been in the last 15 years.  So, a lot of capacity was off - online last year. You can\u2019t overcome capacity to shut down. So this year, we are back to more normal levels. We should see the business return to where it\u2019s at. So, and I think, as you couple that low environment with some of the growth projects of that we\u2019ve got in place and the expenses that come with that, you see the impact with that.  But beyond that, I think the business is running sound. We\u2019ve always had a focus on efficiencies and becoming better operators that's and we find a margins environments like this, it just sharpened that focus and makes it even clear to the organization why that is so important. And so that\u2019s what I referenced. I would tell you our folks are motivated to roll their sleeves up and dig deep and hard and support the growth plans that we\u2019ve got going forward. I think the final point I'd make there just in terms of our operations and execution, you don\u2019t look much further in the projects and the points I tried to make and what we delivered across our entire portfolio, that was in Refining, that was in Chemical and that was in the Upstream.  The things we talked about two years ago, very large projects basically delivered as we said and working as we said. So, that\u2019s significant and I would just again reemphasize the project in Rotterdam which was a brand new technology and process. Never before implemented in a refinery around the world. We brought that on, came up into operating today exactly as designed. That\u2019s a pretty astounding accomplishment that I don\u2019t think any of our competitors could make today. Jon Rigby : Right. Good. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. You mentioned FID for Guyana in Brazil in 2020, so could we expect Mozambique as well at some point in the year? Darren Woods : Yes, Mozambique, we are working with our partners on. We are making progress with respect to that. But I would think, as we make progress, we will FID that when we get to the right stage. I think right now, we are working towards a timeline that would give us production somewhere back in 2025, something like that. Jon Rigby : Okay. Thanks a lot. Darren Woods : You bet. Thanks, Jon. Operator : Next we will go to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning everybody. Declining dispersion of return to capital for the big oils suggest that competitive advantages may be converging between the different industry players over 5 to 10 years and on this point, you guys have historically indicated and I think you did a few minutes ago, the technology and scale and integration were key advantages that differentiated Exxon Mobil and lead to value creation over a longer term period.  So my question is whether this premise is still as valid in your view meaning why your portfolio of opportunities is arguably the best in the peer group, maybe the strongest in a long time. Are you still as confident as you ever about the strength of your competitive advantages and the returns profile and results have proved this overtime? Or has it changed? And if it has changed, which area is becoming more difficult to defend? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Doug, I appreciate the question. Obviously competition always makes this a challenging area and you\u2019ve got to continue to innovate you want to try to maintain a premium above and beyond what the rest of competition is doing and we remain convinced that that premium will be driven by technology and technology developments.  And I would also tell you we\u2019re convinced that that premium will be earned through our other competitive advantages. I\u2019ll talk a lot about the project execution that we\u2019ve got in place. I think that is a huge competitive advantage. So, I continue to believe that we will have returns on capital employed that are higher than our competitors driven by those advantages.  I think you got to step back and look at that over a broader timeline. If you look at where we are at today and investments that we\u2019re making, those projects are very accretive and very high returns, but we are in the early stages of the capital without realizing the benefits of those. And so I think, as you go through time, you are going to see that move in any one year, but over the longer cycle, you are going to see the advantages of those begin to accrue.  I mean, look at what we are doing in Guyana and the comments that I made around the discoveries. Enormous amount of resources that the organization has found and are bringing on with leading edge developments. That's got to drive better returns. I mean, the chart that we've showed demonstrates that. Look at what we are doing in the Downstream business. Historically, a low-margin, low-return business. One of the reasons why we haven't invested heavily in that business in the past is we couldn't find advantaged investments to change that yield profile. With the breakthroughs that we've had in some of our process technology work and catalyst, we are now unlocking some of that as you've seen with Rotterdam.  Again, there is technology that's giving us an upgrade in value at a capital cost much lower than what the rest of industry could achieve. We are taking that same process technology into Singapore and upgrading even lower value streams to higher value products, So, again at a lower capital cost. We are going to see those are higher returns and if you look at the - on the Chemical side, we are very focused and the investments we are making are all driven by performance products. You start with large-scale facilities. You fill them initially with commodity and then you grow performance products and eventually those products \u2013 those plants switch over to all performance products. And so again, a higher return. So each one of the businesses, we have a clear line of sight of how we gain advantage across competition and the question is when will those manifest themselves.  It will be, one, a function of where we are at in that investment versus production cycle and where the \u2013 any one years, those margins are at. But ultimately, I don't see a change in the recipe or the dynamics that would change where we've been historically. Doug Terreson : Okay. And then also, the integrated business model has been the most productive model in the energy sector for several decades, although I guess, changes to competitive structure could always change that in the future. So, consistent with the points I think you just made about technology and execution, multinational experience et cetera, do you still consider the integrated model to be optimal?  And the one that holds the greatest potential for superior returns and shareholder outcomes? And also Darren, has your thinking changed any on this topic over the past several years? Darren Woods : I would tell you I still believe this is an area of value and the only change in my thinking is, how much more potential there is to be realized in that process. I think you are aware, Doug, that we brought the entire organization together on the Houston campus starting in 2014. First time in the history of our company, where we had all of our businesses on one location, which allows those organizations to continue to explore and look for synergies.  And I would tell you that we are in the early stages of finding a lot of significant opportunities. The projects organization is a great example of that. First time in our history that we had our Upstream, Chemical and our Downstream projects organization together and a lot of opportunities to take advantage of each of the strengths of those organizations applied to the other parts of the organization.  So we like what we are seeing there. I'd tell you, if you want to look to a concrete example of what integration has brought to the company, look no further than the logistics that we started investing in to connect our Upstream developments with our Downstream and Chemical assets.  In 2018, as the differentials opened up, we made $1.8 billion on that disconnect, which I think only an integrated company could capture. And that comes and goes and as we talked about in 2019, those differentials weren't there. But we anticipate that they will be back.  And the final point I would make with integration, if you look at what we are doing in the Permian and the investments that we are making in Chemical and Refining, those are geared toward the barrels coming out of the Permian and some of the opportunities we see with those barrels. That would have been hard to do if we were a standalone Downstream company or a standalone Upstream company.  So, only having both of those and being able to understand what's happening in each of those areas that you can find some unique value. So, I am convinced we have a lot more advantages to bring to the table that over time begin to manifest themselves as we continue to exercise the organizations that we've put in place down at the campus. Doug Terreson : Yes. It sounds like the case is as strong as ever at least for you guys. And thanks again for joining us, Darren. Darren Woods : You bet, Doug. Nice talking with you. Operator : Next we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the call, Darren. Darren Woods : Good morning. Roger Read : I guess, so much of what we've heard from Exxon and from some of your peers is, it's definitely an unfavorable - call it, I guess, generally cyclical downturn here across all the various pieces. But the one area I was kind of curious about and is as weak as anything else seems to be on the global gas side. You are one of the major players in the LNG markets.  You've got several different locations where you are looking to expand over the next couple of years. I was just curious how you see that sort of playing its way out. And whether or not there are any issues on the demand side there. Darren Woods : Yes, I would \u2013 you look at, I think, separate out maybe the LNG business with domestic gas business, those have some slightly different dynamics associated with them. Overall, continuing to see very good growth in the gas business. LNG, I think we are seeing and projecting about 4% growth, annual growth in LNG.  I think both stories, both domestic and LNG is, again, it's very similar to the discussions that we are having in the Downstream and Chemicals, which is fairly solid and good growth. But we are seeing short-term oversupply and therefore lower margins and our expectation is that that demand will continue to grow in part driven by concerns of climate change and replacing coal for gas.  But also, just as economies grow and people's standards of living grow, and more power is needed, gas is a very reliable and secure source of supply for power generation. So I think that dynamic is going to continue to happen. I think the LNG oversupply over time will work itself out. And I think investments in that space will probably slow and eventually the demand will catch up to the supply and things will improve.  Again, it's the same dynamic of capital-intensive, long cycle investments and as those come on to the market, adjusts - and compared to demand, it just takes some time for those two to reach in balance. But you typically see that and I don't think that that dynamic is going to change. That's why, of course, we are very focused as we look at these investments of making sure that as you look across the global supply curve that we are on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, that the projects that we are investing in will have advantages and be lower cost than the broader industry and competition, so that as that oversupply impacts margins.  We are on that left-hand side and can see - still see advantages to having those investments. Yes, the same dynamic that I've talked about in our Downstream and Chemical investments. The large investments that we've brought online and yet, we are making money in bottom of cycle conditions, why? Because they were advantaged and we wouldn't invest in those until we found a way to get them advantaged. Same is true in the LNG business. Roger Read : Great, thanks and then, kind of along the lines of some of the other things you've talked about on potential for deferring CapEx if needed to keep things in balance. As we think about the dividend growth and I know you can't give us the number, whatever it goes to the Board.  But how should we think about dividend growth in a kind of cash flow constrained environment with the larger commitment here to the CapEx side? Darren Woods : Well, I think as I've talked about before, and as we look at the business from a macro standpoint in allocation of capital. We start with in order for this business to maintain a long-term value proposition. We have to continue to invest and we have to continue to develop projects and opportunities that are advantaged versus industry. So that's a priority making sure that we invest in this capital too and certainly in the Upstream to offset the depletion that we know occurs in both the crude and gas side of the house. And in the Downstream, making sure that we are using technology to improve the yields as society's demand patterns change and those yield profiles change on a barrel of crude.  And then, in Chemical is to keep up with the pace of high performance products that meet the needs of growing economies and populations where their standards of living are improving. And so, that's kind of job number one and we got to make sure that we continue to do that to keep pace and to have a long kind of prosperous business as we look into the future.  We also feel very firmly that we've got a commitment with our shareholders to provide a reliable and growing dividend. So we would continue to look to do that and ride through these price cycles. Given the strength of the long-term fundamentals, we think that's an appropriate thing to do. And so, we would look to continue that trend of steady and reliable growth.  And then, of course, it\u2019s maintaining the balance sheet and our financial capacity with where it needs to be to ride through these cycles and to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in the down cycles. And then to also mitigate and manage the volatility that we've seen and recently experienced. So, that's kind of as we think about it the primary criteria for how we use cash.  And at the end of the day, we met our criteria and we've got additional cash and then we go into buybacks and return excess cash to the shareholders. That's been the model for a long time. And I would tell you that that model remains pretty effective as we think about what we need to do in this business. Roger Read : Thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll go to Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Phil Gresh : Hi, Darren. Thanks for taking my question. And so, as we look at where you are on the asset sale plan, you talked about $15 billion over three years, $25 billion longer-term. There has been some reports out talking about maybe the plan is moving faster than that in terms of the three year plan.  So, I just want to get your latest thoughts as to, relative to the risks of plan that you laid out there, how you are feeling about that now? And in terms of - if it does come in better, is the first use of asset sale proceeds basically going to be to fund any dividend coverage gap to this investment phase if we're at the bottom of the cycle here again in 2020 or to your point on buybacks, is that even in the cards in that type of scenario. Thanks. Darren Woods : Sure, Phil. Good morning to you. I would tell you, as we introduce the divestment program, and Neil Chapman talked about that last year, we always said it was a risk program and the intention was to put we would have more assets out because we didn't expect to transact on all of those opportunities. And so, I think the reports that you are seeing reflect the fact that there are - we are looking \u2013 we've got a number of assets out in the marketplace today.  Again, we don't expect to transact on all of those and so we've made some risking in judgment. And whether or not, we exceed the numbers that we've talked about or in fact fall below this will be a function of the buyers and the deal space we find with those buyers.  Clearly, last year, we found an opportunity where a buyer had saw a value \u2013 a higher value than we thought we could realize with our Norway asset that resulted in a transaction. I think a win-win for both of us. If we find more of those, more than we have anticipated, then I think we'll be above. On the other hand, we've had deals that we've worked and couldn't find the deal space and didn't transact. So, and that was the point I'm trying to make in my comments. This is really around a portfolio of high-grade and the only way I can convince myself that we are upgrading the portfolio is if we realize the value for an asset that's higher than what we think we can realize by keeping it in our portfolio. And so, I would just tell you, how fast that goes and how far we go is really going to be a function of the buyers and the opportunities that we find. And we're going to look at it that way. I am not \u2013 while we try to estimate what we think we'll bring in, I am not going to sacrifice the value proposition to hit any particular number and I am not going to pace it, I am not going to worry about the pacing as much as I am around the value proposition associated with it. And then, with respect to the proceeds, as I mentioned when we rolled this out, it's all really a function of the broader environment. If we see margins improve in our businesses. If we see prices rise in the Upstream and we bring in more revenue, we'll look at those balances. We certainly want to keep our projects funded.  We are going to continue to grow reliable dividends. So those are going to be the first calls on that cash and then we are going to make sure that we keep the balance sheet whole and where we need it to be. And so I think, those will be the priorities and at the end of the day, we'll see where we are at with that and make decisions on buyback after it. Phil Gresh : Sure. Okay. Second question, just, I think, probably the standard one we ask every quarter. But just, it seems like the energy sector valuations continue to deteriorate here at least for the public companies we are looking on our screen.  So, from your perspective, is this an environment where you think valuations are getting more compelling to you in terms of potential M&A opportunities? Or just how do you think about that today? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks Phil. I think you know, well, first I would say, I believe that the highest value opportunities are the ones that you can generate organically because almost by definition, you are not paying a premium for them. And so I think, we've got a really attractive portfolio as we've talked about and that's what anything that we do has to compete against is those organic opportunities.  And so, that's my starting point and then, we look to see if there are opportunities out there that we can transact on that compete or are better than those organic opportunities. And while the short-term market fluctuations are moving around, and you see that valuation change, obviously, the ability to capture that will be a function of people who are in the market selling and their longer term views of their business and whether or not what position they are in and whether they are forced to take the current valuations or whether they think longer-term and look at the value somewhat differently.  So I think again, it's kind of a difficult to talk about generically. It will be a very specific case-by-case basis. We - just as we are active in the divestment side of the house and have got assets that we're out there marketing, we keep a very firm finger on the pulse of the industry and the opportunities and keep our eyes open for opportunities that could bring additional value to the company. Phil Gresh : Okay. Thanks. Darren Woods : You bet. Good talking to you, Phil. Operator : And next we'll go to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a question going back to the financial capacity. The numbers you referenced in your chart, I think were net debt-to-market cap, what we normally kind of look at is, either net debt-to-capital employed or net debt-to-cash flow. When I think about the capital employed number or the equity, I guess, investors need to be confident in the value of equity.  And what we've seen in the last year or so, as a number of your peers announced impairments due to lower price decks. So could you \u2013 are you willing to share what price deck you are using for oil and gas to test for impairments? That would be my first question. Darren Woods : Yes, thanks Biraj. We don't typically put out a price deck and I wouldn't \u2013 I don't have any desire to kind of start doing that. Let me maybe tell you a little bit about how we think about pricing going forward. And the first thing I would say is, I don't think any of our peers and certainly within ExxonMobil, we feel like we can predict prices.  I think there are just way too many variables involved. Too many developments that occur over time to really, I think, get firm handles on where short-term prices are going to go. What we do, do though is looking forward in the future and we start with kind of building up what I would say is a very fundamental approach to what will drive oil and gas demand, which comes back to economic growth and policies and all of those assumptions and how we think about how the world will evolve with respect to our industry.  We publish in our energy outlook. So if you're interested in understanding what's driving our pricing assumptions, I would start with our energy outlook, because that forms the basis of everything that we do with respect to how we think about the future and how we make investment decisions.  Again since that's our basis and then, since our business is commodity, we continue to believe that in the medium to long-term that market prices will be set by the marginal \u2013 the cost and return criteria of the marginal barrel that's needed to meet that demand. And so, it's classic economic supply and demand, marginal producer sets the market price.  We try to take a kind of a high-level view of that. What will be the resources that come on and meet that last barrel of demand? And that is the view that we take around what will kind of be the price-setting mechanisms in the market. And of course, that evolves over time. And that's what sets generally our price outlook is, the economic and the demand side of the equation including advances in technology, including additional regulations in policy around the world. And then we look at where technology could go and what supply sources will come on and what we will set the kind of the cost of supply, and then set our pricing. When we finish that exercise, we step back and compare our view with other published views, third-party reviews and check for reasonableness to the extent that other companies publish their numbers we look and compare to make sure that our estimates at least appear reasonable.  And generally they are always within the range, maybe perhaps on the low side of what we typically see out there. But that's how we do it. And you can imagine that process does not lead to huge changes year-on-year, simply because, the fundamentals that I referred to don't dramatically change year-on-year. They do evolve obviously.  Certainly, if you think about the tight gas or the shale revolution, that was an evolving and developing story. And that obviously had impacts on the marginal tiers of supply, which had impacts on pricing. But that has been kind of an evolution that's been built into the price deck over the years and it\u2019s pretty constant now.  So, that's how we do it and that's how we think about it and then we make our investment decisions based on that. And then test really on the low side and the high side to make sure that the investments that we are putting in place are robust to cycles that we know we are going to see. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay, noted. The second question, I just wonder if you could give us an update on Papua New Guinea. And there were some article this morning about negotiations with the government not going according to plan for the expansions. Could you update us on where that project is? And what that means to the FID? Darren Woods : Sure. Let me just start with maybe the bigger picture of Papua New Guinea. Obviously, we are the operator of the PNG LNG project, which was a $19 billion project. It's brought employment to about 3,200 people in Papua New Guinea. Since 2010, we've spent about over $4 billion on Papua New Guinean services including about $2 billion spent with the landowner companies.  We've invested almost $300 million in community and infrastructure programs focused on education, health, women's empowerment, a number of other areas. So, the established business that we have there I think has been a real benefit to Papua New Guinea and obviously, a benefit for us. We are looking at this expansion and we are looking at bringing in the Papua project with Total, along with P'Nyang and have been in negotiations with the government.  We are disappointed here recently that we weren't able to reach agreement with the government on P'Nyang. But we are very hopeful that those discussions can move forward and continue. I think, from our perspective, we've got to find a way to get to a win-win proposition. We've got our big portfolio of opportunities as I've been referring to here this morning and anything that we decide to FID and move forward has to compete within that portfolio. So, that's the basis on which we are looking at this negotiation and working with the government. Need to be a win-win. I think we'll continue to try to establish that with the government.  But I also think we've got some time given all the other opportunities in front of us. And frankly, given where we are at today in the supply demand balance of LNG, I think we can - we've got time to work it with the government and I am hopeful and I am fairly confident that at some point we'll find a way forward with them. Biraj Borkhataria : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning everyone. Darren Woods : Good morning, Jeanine. Neil Hansen : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : So, I guess my first question is on the Permian and it\u2019s dovetailing off of Neil's question. And then specifically on the rig count. So can you provide a little more color on how operations are going? And if there is any change in the number of rigs you see required to make the 1 million barrels a day that you laid out earlier?  So, when we look at the data, the rig count has been trending flat to down over the past six months. And I know that the rig counts can be pretty deceiving, given improving efficiencies and all. But have you encountered anything unexpected in particular, we're referring to the subsurface in the Delaware? Darren Woods : Yes, let me - I'll talk high-level. First of all, I am not a big believer in extrapolating rig counts into kind of what we are doing in the business and the approach that we are taking and the progress we are making in the development. I think it's a fairly crude measure, particularly for the work that we have been doing there.  As you recall, what we laid out in the Permian and particularly in the Delaware was a large-scale approach, which is \u2013 which was unique to industry that leverages the scale that we have as a corporation, leverages the technology, some of the resources that we have within the company. And we have been developing the tools to model and develop that resource that we think is pretty unique in the industry.  We've used a lot of rigs to help delineate what we are doing in that space. And as we collect that information, build those models and optimize, I think you're going to see movements around what we are doing there. So, I would not again take too much - draw too many conclusions from strictly speaking the rig count. And with respect to that work that we've been doing, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we feel really good about the progress that we're making and seeing significant improvements in the initial production across 365 days and longer. We like what we are seeing with the recovery rates. We like what we're seeing with the D&C costs and those are coming down.  And we like what we see around some of the well performance, particularly in the Delaware. I think if you look at the results that we are getting, we are leading industry, I think it's fair to say. So, good progress there and it's just really a question of how we want to continue going forward and pace that. And I know that Neil and his team are looking at that in light of the environments that we've come out of in 2019.  And when we get to March, I think the folks will spend some time kind of sharing some of the proof points, some of the data with you to help you get a better picture of that. And then we'll talk more about kind of how we see the path going forward here. But bottom-line, the potential of that and the value propositions that we've talked about haven't changed, if anything, we like it better. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you. Jeanine Wai : And then, just switching gears here quickly, as far as the light-sweet, heavy-sour spreads being slower than expected to adjust and the crude discounts maybe not being at full parity with the product pricing, you indicated in your prepared remarks that ultimately you expect these issues to improve or reverse. And so my question is, could this be a potential tailwind for as early as 1Q?  And any additional comments you have on just timing and how you see that developing would be really helpful. Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. I don't \u2013 when you say it\u2019s developing slower than predicted, I don't know that we ever had a real firm prediction on how this is going to play out. I mean, the markets have got a lot of variables that go into it. This was a known event that was going to happen. And so, a lot of different players, a very fragmented market, lots of different actions with storage and inventory.  And so, I think really difficult to predict exactly how all those variables and all those independent actions come together and results in what we're seeing in the marketplace. I can tell you, what you see is explainable. You can certainly put a rationale behind how long it takes to play out and get back to what we think eventually will be more market parity. I think it's really a function of where the different inventories and how people are choosing to optimize around the new requirements with respect IMO. The reason why we are convinced that eventually we'll get back to parity is because the fundamentals associated with IMO are pretty clear and the kind of the economics of refining aren't real hard to figure out.  As you've taken sulfur out and the valuation of high sulfur feedstocks and products have dropped down, that's got to make itself back into the crude and crudes that are higher sulfur and heavier, they are producing more of those lower value products ultimately have to reflect the fact that their product, the yield profile of that barrel of crude is less attractive.  So, I think, that's a pretty foundational element of crude markets in refining and eventually those will hold. And then, in the short-term depending on the different actions that folks have taken and what their position is and what moves it did earlier and what inventories look like, it's going to take time to work itself out. I would tell you from our perspective, we manage this based on the longer-term fundamentals. We made investments based on the longer-term fundamentals. We didn't make any investments that assumed credit for this transition and the benefits that might come along with it given a particular investment. We just recognized it would come, but the decisions that were made were based on more of the longer-term fundamentals. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Darren Woods : Thank you, Jeanine. Neil Hansen : And operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : Right. We will take that question from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Okay, thanks. Maybe a quick follow-up on some of your comments earlier on the LNG markets. Are you seeing \u2013 can you comment on whether you are seeing any pressure on existing or currently negotiated contracts? And also some of your European peers have been successful in offsetting at least some of the ongoing price weakness and the medium-term price weakness via active portfolio trading globally?  I believe you've looked to increase those capabilities across your organization globally. Can you maybe talk about progress in that direction? And how you may be able to mitigate medium-term weakness in global LNG prices? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I think, you're right. Your observations are pretty solid in terms of there are opportunities with portfolio trading to try to mitigate some of that shorter-term weakness. And I think, as you look at the markets, you see the market is kind of slowly evolving along those lines. At the same time, a lot of the buyers in LNG market are interested in ensuring long-term deliveries and surety of supply. And so, there is still a desire for the longer-term contracts as new projects are FIDed and developed often times a financing requires, secured outlets and terms on that. So, there are a lot of underlying dynamics that keep what I would say is the more traditional longer-term transactions in place. And so, while I think the markets will continue to develop and there'll be more trading on top of that.  I think there will still be a layer of what I would say is the historical approach to LNG. And that will be a very slow moving transition over time. With respect to the LNG trading that we have, it's been widely reported and I have talked about it the last time I was on. We have begun looking and moving more into some of the trading as that market evolves. But our intention is to kind of evolve with the needs of the market and that will just become a bigger piece of our business as that becomes a bigger piece of the market and more relevant to the market. Ryan Todd : Okay. Perfect, thanks. And then maybe one quick follow-up on Chemicals. Obviously, it's been a tough environment and you talked about the eventual rebalancing from a supply/demand point of view. Can you talk about, I guess, as we look over the next 12 months to 18 months, what you see maybe in terms of some of the market dynamics and the recovery from that point of view?  And you highlight in your presentation growth-related expenses of $160 million, at least on a delta basis in the quarter. You have a pretty active growth program. Any help on maybe the direction of magnitude of those growth-related expenses going forward? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. I think \u2013 so let me start with your last point around growth-related expenses. I mean, obviously as large capital projects or large manufacturing investments, as you progress those, there are costs come along with them. I think you can think about those growth-related costs in three basic buckets. The first is, as you bring on new investments, so the steam crackers that we\u2019ve brought on, the polyethylene lines that we brought on was different investments that are up and running.  Obviously, there are costs associated with those new investments and as we first bring those up, we categorize those as growth expenses because they are new facilities and we want to make sure as we look at those, we think about those different than what the basic expenses are since we are driving base cost down. We've got at the same time recognized that more cost will come in from operating new facilities. So that's one bucket.  Other projects that are in construction. So as an example, our cracker in Corpus Christi area, there are expenses associated with in-progress projects, which is another bucket to think about with growth. That's oftentimes not as large because a lot of the costs associated with that development gets capitalized. But there are expenses to go along with it. So that's within the bucket.  And then the third growth expense is, as we look at further into the future and look at opportunities and project teams are working, the next project to fill the pipeline further out, that's a growth expense. And so, in the Chemical businesses, that's how you should think about those growth expenses.  And obviously, we keep a pretty close eye on those and are making sure that as we grow, we are growing as efficiently as possible. But also recognize that activity has to be funded and therefore recognize and accept those expenses. With respect to the when the cycle and how we see things playing itself out, it's really a function of where growth goes. I mentioned really strong growth in the polyethylene business, the polypropylene business. We continue to see that that. We have to see how the world economies evolve here. China, obviously has got some challenges here in the short-term that may manifest themselves in the quarter.  So, difficult to see how long and what impact that will have on and where China goes. That's obviously a big player in the Chemical business. Our perspective is, while we are interested and try to look at where that cycle is \u2013 how long that cycle is going to last and where it goes to, we recognize we don't control it. And so, focusing on the things that we can do to make sure that as we are in that down cycle that we are successful by making sure we are running efficiently, keeping our cost down really ensuring that all of our production on the margin is profitable is what the organization is focused on. I think this year will continue to be a challenging year for our Chemical business. But I think as we get in the year further out, we will start to see some things improve. And then, it's just the slope of that improvement will be a function of a lot of different things that frankly it's hard to predict that far out.  I'll come back to you though, we know these cycles are going to happen and we know it's the impact on our business is driven by the sectors that we've chosen to invest in and market in. If you go back in time, those decisions have proven to be very beneficial to the company. And in fact, one of the reasons we find the margins where they are is because that's attracted a lot of additional investment.  Growth will take us out of that and it's just a function of while we are waiting for that growth to catch -up and exceed that capacity, we got to make sure that we are managing this business as tightly as we can. So that we can stay as profitable as we can. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thank you. Neil Hansen : All right. Thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight our fourth quarter and full year that included a number of key milestones and continued progress across our portfolio. And we look forward to seeing everyone on March 5th at our Investor Day in New York.  We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in Exxon Mobil. As a quick introduction, my name is Stephen Littleton. I assumed the role of Vice President of Investor Relations on March 15. Joining me on the call today is our Chairman and CEO Darren Woods. Before discussing our results, I would like to express our hope that all of you listening and your families are safe and taking the appropriate steps to fight the coronavirus. These are challenging and unprecedented times as the world deals with and adapts to the coronavirus pandemic. Global economies have slowed down significantly as governments work to contain the disease. During the call today, we will put our results into context and share with you how our business performed in the first quarter. After I cover the quarterly, financial and operating results, Darren will provide his perspectives reflecting on the broader market environment and steps we're taking to both respond to these challenges and ensure we remain well positioned for the recovery. Following Darren's remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results, while Darren will be available to take your question on broader themes, including the corporation's actions related to COVID, progress on major growth projects, strategic priorities and views on market fundamentals. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and supplemental information at the end of this presentation. As referenced in the cautionary statement, please take note that in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced spending plans, we've put in place many of the forward-looking statements from our Investor Day have changed. We will provide a perspective on updates during this call and will provide a longer-term perspective as we head into next year. I'll now highlight developments since the fourth quarter on the next slide. In the Upstream, liquids realizations fell significantly through the quarter, approximately 55%, as impacts from the coronavirus rippled through the global economy significantly reducing demand. From an operational standpoint liquids production increased by 2% from the fourth quarter leading to the highest quarterly liquids production since 2016, including a 15% increase in liquids from the Permian. If we look at total production from the Permian, it has increased by 20%. Kearl achieved record production in the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of the investment in additional ore crushing capacity, which will further reduce unit costs. Offshore Brazil, the Uirapuru exploration well discovered hydrocarbons and results are now being analyzed to inform further exploration activities. In the Downstream, refining margins fell to similar levels as first quarter 2019 and remain near 10-year lows with the COVID impact significantly reducing demand in March. Refinery utilization was essentially flat with lower maintenance levels than the prior quarter largely offset by reduced demand. Margins improved in the Chemical business benefiting from lower liquids feedstock prices. Our employees have stepped up in a significant way to support the ongoing COVID-19 response efforts. Darren will provide additional details on how we are maximizing production of key products, redirecting shareholder contributions and lending our technical expertise to aid healthcare workers, first responders and others in the fight against the coronavirus. Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative to fourth quarter 2019. For context, let me walk you through the impact of the identified items. Starting with the fourth quarter 2019. The results of $5.7 billion included identified items of $3.9 billion, notably the Norway divestment. Excluding these items, fourth quarter results were $1.8 billion. Despite this challenging environment, the underlying business results, excluding identified items were $2.3 billion, up $500 million from the fourth quarter. As shown in the middle section of this table, liquids growth and lower operating expenses increased earnings, while the absence of year-end LIFO impacts was a partial offset. U.S. GAAP first quarter earnings of a negative $600 million include the impacts of two separate non-cash identified items. The first was an adjustment to inventory valuation. Given the significant drop in commodity prices in the first quarter, the book value of our inventory was adjusted downward to reflect the lower market values in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This lower cost of market adjustment resulted in a charge of $2.1 billion. It is important to note that we may see further adjustments during the year or potentially an unwinding of the first quarter impact depending on changes in commodity prices going forward. The second item was related to impairments of about $800 million. Market conditions in the first quarter which included significant reductions in both commodity prices and equity markets required an assessment of carrying values for some assets. This evaluation resulted in noncash impairment charges of approximately $800 million to recognize reduced market values assigned to goodwill and an upstream equity company again consistent with U.S. GAAP. Turning now to slide five, we'll look at each of our businesses in detail excluding identified items I just discussed starting with the Upstream. Upstream earnings excluding identified items decreased by approximately $1 billion, largely driven by lower prices which reduced earnings by more than $1.7 billion with liquid realizations down 25% and gas realizations down 10% versus the fourth quarter. This was partly offset by favorable foreign exchange impacts and higher volumes, primarily from strong growth in the Permian and Guyana. Lower expenses and favorable tax items were also a help to earnings. On the next slides, I will provide more details on volumes. Liquids volumes grew by approximately 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter of 2019. Divestments, primarily the Norway non-operated business reduced liquids volumes by 95000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Growth of 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day was underpinned by the Permian and Guyana Phase 1 ramp-up at Kearl and Hebron and the Upper Zakum project in Abu Dhabi. Permian production in the quarter was more than 350,000 oil equivalent barrels per day an increase of 56% versus the prior year or 126,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Natural gas volumes were down 88,000 oil equivalent barrels per day versus the prior quarter, driven by Norway and Mobile Bay divestments as well as lower demand. Moving to Downstream on the next slide, earnings excluding identified items increased by more than $400 million relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. The absence of year-end LIFO inventory adjustments and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced earnings by nearly $700 million. Favorable margin impacts increased earnings by more than $900 million. The increase was driven by positive mark-to-market trading benefits which were partly offset by lower refining margins as demand declined in the quarter particularly in March. We also saw impact related to no demand with COVID-19, but this was more than offset by lower expenses that increased earnings by $300 million. Moving to the next slide, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings excluding identified items increased by more than $800 million with a significant improvement in margins from lower fee costs across the value chain, reflecting the benefit of integration. Additionally, lower expenses contributed approximately 30% of the earnings improvement. Let's turn to the next page for a look at first quarter cash profile. First quarter earnings when adjusted for depreciation expense, non-cash identified items, changes in working capital, and other impacts yielded $6.3 billion in cash flow from operating activities. Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $6.4 billion. Shareholder distributions were $3.7 billion consistent with fourth quarter and leaving $2.7 billion after distributions. First quarter additions to PP&E and net investments and advances were $6.5 billion. As noted in the press release, CapEx was $7.1 billion in the quarter. As the amounts reductions are implemented, CapEx will trim down over the course of the remaining year. Gross debt increased approximately $13 billion in the quarter as we took steps to increase liquidity in the current market environment. As a result, we ended the quarter with $11.4 billion of cash. Turning to slide 11, I will cover a few items for consideration with regards to our outlook for the second quarter. Given the challenging market conditions production will be lower in the second quarter due to economic shut-ins and market-related curtailments. At this time, the estimated second quarter impact is 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Also in the Upstream, natural gas production will be lower due to seasonal demand with an expected impact of approximately 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. In the Downstream, we are seeing impact from reduced demand with continued pressure on refining margins. For the second quarter, we anticipate sparing of approximately 25% of our refining capacity. Scheduled maintenance is anticipated to be in line with levels from the first quarter. In Chemical, we anticipate continued margin support from lower liquids feedstock pricing while noting that overall realizations remain near bottom cycle for many of our products. Sentiment for the second quarter Chemical demand is mixed bearing across product segments. Demand for packaging and hygiene is expected to remain strong, while automotive and durables demand will continue to be challenged. Similar to Downstream scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with the previous quarter. Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $900 million. Finally, we will continue to progress spending reductions in line with our recent announcement. With that I'll turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Stephen and good morning, everybody. I hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. We certainly appreciate you taking time to join us today. I think we can all agree that these are very challenging times. And I know, I speak for many when I say that our thoughts are with those who have been personally affected by this pandemic with the health care workers and first responders who are on the front lines. This morning, I will discuss how we are approaching the current circumstances and how we are working to keep our people and communities safe managing through the near-term market downturn and preserving long-term shareholder value. As you well know, today we face two acute challenges : a global threat to public health and a significant global economic downturn resulting in a commodity price collapse. What started with an oversupply situation was made more extreme by a sudden and unprecedented drop in energy demand as the economy shut down to stop the spread of the virus. As a capital-intensive commodity business, we certainly weathered the ups and downs of many price cycles. However, I have to say we've never seen anything like what the world is experiencing today. Our response is primarily focused on three areas : protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to provide the critical energy and products that support modern life and the COVID response efforts and aggressively reducing spend in today's depressed markets, while preserving value to ensure we are in the best position for the eventual recovery. I know that there are a lot of different views on what the future holds, but I want to be clear on how we see it. The long-term fundamentals that drive our business have not changed. Despite the current uncertainty and volatility, the fundamentals that underpin our business remains strong. Why do I say that? We know that in the coming decades populations will grow to more than 9 billion people by 2040 up from just over 7 billion today. Billions of people will enter the middle class and seek lifestyles and products that require energy. Economies will expand once again. Of course, there are likely to be some bumps in the road over the short-term, but historically periods of economic contraction are followed by periods of significant growth. Finally as a result of growing populations increased prosperity and economic expansion, energy consumption will increase. Even with the current downturn projections show energy consumption growing by 20% through 2040. Most of the growth will be in developing nations and more than half of that energy demand will be met by oil and natural gas. As you all know, we are a company that focuses on the long term. Our strategy in business is based on long time horizons which is why we always go back to the fundamentals. At the same time, we have to address short-term challenges such as the unprecedented market conditions we face today while not losing sight of long-term value. This is exactly what we're doing. We're taking advantage of the options a deep portfolio and strong balance sheet provide reprioritizing spend to conserve cash, while progressing projects that structurally improve the company. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities investing in industry-advantaged projects that grow cash flow and support a reliable growing dividend and strong balance sheet. Obviously in this environment, it's critical to strike the right balance across these priorities and to remain flexible to market developments including an eventual recovery. And of course, we do all this while keeping our people and communities safe protecting the environment and delivering the products that society rely on. Further to that point, let me take a few minutes to discuss our response to the pandemic. Early into the pandemic, we activated our emergency response teams and implemented our business continuity plans. People who could began working from home, while additional cleaning, personal protective equipment and distancing protocols were put in place at our facilities. To-date, we've been largely successful limiting exposure and infections at our sites. To support society's broader response we increased our production of both isopropyl alcohol, a key ingredient in sanitizer and specialty polypropylene used in medical masks and hospital gowns. On top of that, our people in Baton Rouge reconfigured operations to produce, blend, package and distribute medical-grade hand sanitizer. We're donating this product to health care providers and first responders in Louisiana, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. We're also supporting efforts to design, produce and distribute new reusable medical masks and face shields to help with the shortages. And we're helping our communities around the world with donations to schools, support for food banks, and fuel, meals and masks for health care workers and first responders. I'm extremely proud of our employees. They're taking care of themselves and their families, supporting response efforts around the world, and doing their jobs, which is what I want to turn to next, starting with the pandemic's impact on the market. This chart provides a perspective of third-party supply demand projections. The dotted lines represent IEA's forecast and the blue shaded area shows the range of demand projections. As you can see, it's a pretty broad range. Our views are pretty consistent with the IEA's. April and May demand down 25% to 30%, reflecting significant reductions in the use of gasoline and jet fuel. As we reach the fourth quarter, we expect demand will be below last year due to lost economic activity. Of course, there's a lot of uncertainty on the timing of the recovery. We're planning for a slow one as it takes time to restart businesses and for consumers' confidence to grow. Hopefully, it happens faster than we think. For the full year, estimates range from a loss of 4 million to 12 million barrels per day. We expect it to be on the higher end of the range. As you can see from the red line, while significant the announced cuts of OPEC+ totaling about 13 million barrels per day are insufficient to offset the loss in demand. We're seeing this in growing global inventories, low market prices and increasing number of shut-ins. Based on the third-party demand projections and the announced OPEC+ reductions, supply and demand come into balance and then go short sometime in the second half of the year. When you factor in the growing number of industry shut-insurance, this could happen faster than projected, again depending on the recovery in demand. When it does happen we don't expect to see a market response, until the inventories are worked down. Bottom line here, it's going to be a very challenging summer with a pretty sloppy market as we move into the back half of the year. We've adjusted our plans to a low price and margin environment through year-end. Our price projections tend to be at the low end of third-party estimates. Once again, I hope we're surprised with a quick recovery, which we have not ruled out particularly given our ongoing experience in China. While it's still early days there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic as signs of demand and economic activity are beginning to pick up in China with April sales in three of our key businesses back in line with and slightly above the same period last year. It's too early to tell, if this initial rebound will be sustained, or if it reflects the broader economy, or if it is even relevant to other economies around the world given the range of government responses and policies. Nonetheless, I find it somewhat encouraging and it supports what I know will be true in the medium to long term. Economies will recover. However in the short term, we need to compensate for the significant loss in demand and revenue, which is why we announced a 15% reduction in cash OpEx and a 30% reduction in CapEx for 2020. We initiated an effort in the fourth quarter to drive efficiencies and lower cost, which has served as a springboard to this broader and much deeper effort. Spending will be maintained on activities that are critical to the integrity of our operations, the safety of our people and the protection of the environment. We're focusing on capturing additional efficiencies and lower market prices, deferring less critical spend and prioritizing quick payout items. As you can see in the chart, these efforts are already yielding results. As the year progresses, we expect to see further reductions to achieve our announced target. While doing this we remain sensitive to the unknown. In particular, we are working hard to ensure we maintain the capacity to quickly respond to market changes. We want to be well positioned to capture the eventual upswing. Turning to capital. We took a similar approach. You may recall during our Investor Day that we discussed reductions in our capital spend based on market conditions at the time. I said then that we would continue to monitor the market and make further reductions if required. Shortly thereafter, we intensified work with our venture partners, resource owners and contractors to optimize spend in light of the growing impacts of the pandemic. We set an aggressive objective, reduce spend without compromising the project advantages or returns. Any inefficiencies had to be offset with market savings or other efficiencies. I'm very pleased with the work we have done to date. Through extensive collaboration, we've identified opportunities to reduce our CapEx by 30% down to $23 billion and more than offset deferral costs, preserving the returns and project advantages. As we concluded much of this work during March, very little of it is reflected in our first quarter spend. As we progress through the year, we'll see the reductions ramp up. With a clear line of sight to the savings, I am very confident that we will meet our target. We're reducing small capital projects at most of our sites growing the pace of some downstream and chemical projects and pushing out the development of Mozambique LNG. The largest share of the reduction will be in our unconventional business, specifically the Permian Basin where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted. Let me provide a perspective on this. As we discussed in March, we have the flexibility to reduce spend in the Permian while maintaining scale, preserving capital efficiency and maximizing resource recovery through our cube developments. Neil showed these charts indicating the range of production associated with potential reductions in CapEx. Our revised plans are indicated by the red diamond at the bottom end of the range. Over the course of the year, we expect to ramp rigs down by about 75% in the Permian ending the year at approximately 15 rigs. Our remaining development activity will be focused on Poker Lake and the Delaware Basin where we are seeing high productivity wells and maintaining a scale advantage. This will include utilization of the recently completed Line one at the Cowboy Central Delivery Point. Since most of 2020's production is locked in with the work already completed, reduction in capital spend will primarily affect 2021 where we expect volumes will be down 100,000 to 150,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from our previous estimates. In 2020, the impact of the reduced CapEx will be much lower at about 15,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. A much larger production impact will be associated with shut-ins. With the high production rates of wells in the first two years of operation, it makes economic sense to shut these wells in during very low price environments. For this reason, we expect to shut in roughly 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. The duration of these shut-ins will obviously depend on the evolving price environment. Let me move next to an update on Guyana. Guyana remains an integral part of our long-term growth plans and as such is a high priority. Our Liza Phase 1 operations have been largely unaffected by the pandemic. Production ramp-up is progressing and should reach full capacity in the second quarter. We've also managed the impact on Liza Phase 2 keeping this project on schedule for a 2022 start-up. Unfortunately, the ongoing election process and uncertainty around the next administration has slowed government approvals of the Payara development plan. In addition, the challenge of rotating crews due to the impact of COVID-19 has temporarily slowed our drilling campaign. As a result, we expect a delay in our future developments of roughly six to 12 months pushing our production objective of more than 750,000 barrels per day into 2026. Finally, let me say a few words about our financial capacity which has been built for times like this. As you know, a strong balance sheet is a core competitive advantage and an integral part of our strategy allowing us to maintain our capital allocation priorities across the price cycles. This approach has proven itself during these trying times allowing us to selectively advance critical investments to structurally improve our business despite very low demand and margins. We issued debt of $8.5 billion in the first quarter, increasing our debt to capital to 24% and raising cash balances to more than $11 billion. We also increased our revolving credit facilities to $15 billion. With our cash, this gives us a solid backstop in these uncertain and very volatile markets. In anticipation of a slow economic recovery, we took advantage of a market window in April to issue another $9.5 billion of debt taking our estimated debt to capital to 26% and increasing cash to about $18 billion. This provides a strong foundation to manage the remaining challenges in 2020. Of course, as always we'll need to keep an eye on developments and respond accordingly. In closing, I want to reemphasize that the fundamentals that underpin our business remain unchanged. Our capital allocation priorities also remain the same, investing to create value, rewarding shareholders with a reliable growing dividend and maintaining a strong balance sheet. While we work to conserve cash in the near term, we remain focused on enhancing long-term value, leveraging our competitive advantages and the optionality provided by a deep portfolio of opportunities. We do all this, while working to ensure the safety of our people and communities and doing our part to support society response to pandemic. Our company remains strong. Our people have the skills, experience, and fortitude to not only face the challenges but to find opportunity in them emerging stronger than ever. With that, I'll turn it back to Stephen and we look forward to taking your questions. Stephen Littleton : Thank you for your comments, Darren. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Littleton and Mr. Woods. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Hope all is well and you're safe. So, you've been steadfast on your view of secular energy demand growth with a cyclical pace and it's something you deploy a lot of human capital to. You're not just talking off agency forecasts or anything. So I wonder how that is moving around here in the early days of this crisis. For example, jet fuel, huge component of demand growth out to 2030, but maybe structurally changed. If there's anything in your forecasts on the demand side that are changing on kind of on a structural or long-term basis that might inform how you deploy capital on the other side of the crisis period of the cycle, within the prior range of your five-year plan. Darren Woods : Well, thanks Sam. Hope all is well with you and your family. Yes, we've looked at that. Frankly, it's real difficult to plan a longer-term horizon and factor in the impacts of what we're seeing today when what we're seeing today hasn't fully played out yet. And so I just caveat my comments with the fact that we're in the middle of this thing. And so, we'll see how it kind of plays out through the rest of the year, if it sticks with the forecasts that are out there and what I showed in my prepared comments. But if you look back in time and you can take 9/11 as an example, you have these dips and then over time you see a recovery. And while you start from a lower point, you see a continued growth and a slope that's very consistent with what the world has experienced in the past. I don't think events like this change the basic human nature or people's wants and desires. I don't think it changes people's drive to improve their living -- manage their prosperity. I don't think it changes the economic growth that's required to support growing populations, particularly in some of the developing world. So as you look further out and get past this short-term challenge, I think we're going to be back to the same fundamentals that we've always talked about, because people want a better standard of living for themselves and their family. That is a very basic human dynamic. And as I've shown before many times, as people's standards of living grows, as economies grow the demand for energy will grow with it. Sam Margolin : Thanks. And then just as a follow-up to that theme of kind of exit rate capital spending relative to the prior five-year plan, LNG Exxon had a number of projects identified that were pre-FID. The structural challenge with that asset class always seems like there were a lot of parties that were pursuing a utility model, which sort of compressed the returns profile of it, as it just seemed like a very un-Exxon asset class in that regard. As you think about restoring capital spending to some number closer to your prior five-year range is LNG, the category that you think might have a structural slowdown in the outer years out to 2025, or are those projects still very high on your priority list? Darren Woods : So, I think, Sam, if you go back to the longer-term growth forecast and the demand for fuel, LNG and gas continues to be a fast-growing product and demand for LNG continues to grow. So I think that's going to continue to play a role. I think the -- if you look at the capital projects that were sanctioned and moving forward, many of those have slowed down. Some have been canceled. So I think as we go through this year, there's going to be some things changing around, which projects get sanctioned and move forward what the time frame of those projects are. And then, of course, the demand will pick back up and we'll see gas continue to grow. So my suspicion is, we'll see some shifting around in the schedules. But, again, the fundamentals are going to require additional LNG. And so I would expect to see that continue to be represented to a fairly large extent in our portfolio. What I would say on the utilities type return, it really depends on the specifics of the project. I think you can't look at those as one asset class. As you move around the world there are different dynamics and challenges and risks associated with different LNG projects. And what we look to do is to make sure that the returns of the specific projects meet our criteria. And so, that's I think how we look at it and you got to kind of separate each one individually and look at it. We've got pretty high standards to make sure that we maintain the returns that we need to as a corporation. Thank you, Sam. Sam Margolin : Thank you so much. Be safe. Great. Darren Woods : You too. Operator : We'll go next to Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you. Can I -- just as a follow-on from that, just two things around that commentary about the slowdown and speed up of activity. Can you give a little bit more color on the process you go through about sort of identifying which assets you mothball or slow down how you sort of identify how you preserve value through the sort of lower spending period? And then internally give some indication of how quickly you could mobilize again in terms of people and spending to move back up to the sort of cadence that you were running at pre-COVID if that's possible. That's my first question. Darren Woods : Okay. Well, thanks John. Yes the process -- and if you recall when -- after our Investor Day is as Saudis and Russia made their announcements and then the impact of the COVID started picking up, we shortly after that around mid-March issued a statement that said we were going to revise our capital and OpEx targets for the year. We're going to significantly revise those and then basically announced about a month later what the reductions were. The process we went through I would characterize as a grassroots process in terms of bringing our businesses together talking about the challenges and what we needed to do as a company and then letting the businesses and our project organization step back and start engaging with the relevant stakeholders to figure out how best to make this change. And the point I made in my prepared remarks was a fundamental principle in looking at this was how do we do this recognizing that stopping some projects in progress will have some inefficiencies and costs associated with it. We need to offset those and find ways to do that and this market ought to provide that. And the fact that everybody was experiencing these challenges ought to get people similar motivations to work together and find efficiencies. And so, one key criteria was figuring out where those biggest opportunities were and therefore taking advantage of that to make sure that we did not compromise the returns of the projects. And so part of the criteria was understanding which ones had more flexibility than others. Hence the large reductions in unconventional, the short-cycle investments we had some -- a lot more opportunity in that space. So we saw a large reduction there. That was a key driver. The other then was just looking at the payout of those projects the opportunity, the rewards associated with them and thinking through from a economic profit standpoint, how we want to think about those what's the cost benefit of slowing some of those projects. And so that was another big factor. And third then was working with our partners and the resource owners to get alignment on that. So that was a -- it was a fairly robust process with a number of people involved. We were fortunate to have our projects organization in place. Last year in April, first time in the company's history we put all of our project efforts into one organization. And I would tell you that has paid huge, huge dividends during this process the ability to look across our entire portfolio leverage the relationship with our contractors has been a big, big help. With respect to your last part of your question around, how quickly can you respond I think you heard in my comments again we are anticipating a recovery. In fact, I know one will happen and that these projects remain attractive and we'll want to pursue those. And so, the big question is when and when will that recovery happen, when will we want to turn these back on. So, one of the challenges we gave the organization is while you are taking steps to make these reductions, keep an eye on the future and make sure we have a clear line of sight of how we'll restart and ramp things back up again. And so all the plans we put in place, not only have a ramp-down plan, but we're also working how we could quickly ramp that back up. And of course that will vary by project and by the circumstances within those projects. But I feel again confident that this organization is striking a really good balance between taking short-term action, but preserving long-term value. Jon Rigby : Right. Good. And then just as a follow-up can I just get you to comment on Chem? It obviously as you referenced was still towards the bottom end of the cycle. But it seems to me the last couple of quarters, there's been some signs of improvement. Is that temporary the quarter this 1Q primarily to do with the falling liquids price, or is there some hope there that things are starting to get a little better either internally operationally or from the macro? Darren Woods : Well if you think -- what we've talked about in the past, what we're seeing in the chemical industry is, what I'd call is a classic commodity cycle where we had a lot of capacity brought on in the short term. While growth remains good in those products that excess capacity is overwhelm that growth in the short term and therefore driven margins down to what we're seeing at the back end of last year or really through last year. That has not changed. We continue to see basically a length in oversupply there. And the benefits we saw in the first quarter is really around feedstock and feedstock prices dropping off. To the other point within that is just, if you look at the mix of chemical products that we make, some of those in response to what we're seeing with COVID and the products required demand has grown pretty significantly. We happen to be in a position to make some specialty products that supply those markets and demand for those types of products. So we've seen a boost in that. And obviously as the COVID impacts start to wind down, we should see some of that revert back to what would be standard demand levels. I can tell you the organization remains very focused on a challenging marketplace. Steve you got anything to add to those? Stephen Littleton : Yeah. Jon, the other thing I'd add is if you notice in the bar -- I mean the chart that we put out there, we did see really a significant improvement in our OpEx, which was the earnings benefit for us this quarter in the Chemical business. Darren Woods : Okay. That's a good point. Jon Rigby : Okay. Steve, thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Darren, I guess the first question is around capital allocation and dividend sustainability. We saw one of your peers reduce their dividend in light of the macro environment. Just wanted to get your views on the right level of distribution, how you think about dividend growth and how you think about that in terms of prioritization around capital allocation? Darren Woods : Sure. Good morning, Neil. I think as I said in my prepared remarks and I've repeated in some of our press release, the priorities in the capital allocation scheme that we've got have not changed with what we're seeing here in the short-term. And again it kind of comes back to a large business that has depleting assets. You've got to continue to invest in industry-advantaged accretive projects if you're going to sustain a strong foundation to support the business going forward, a successful business to support a growing and reliable dividend and to maintain a strong balance sheet. So the project's investments are critical foundation to the long-term health of the business. And then obviously if you look at our shareholder base about 70% of them are retail or long-term investors that look for our dividend and see that as an important source of stability in their income. And so we have a strong commitment to that. And then finally, making sure that we have a balance sheet to manage the volatility that we see in the ups and downs of the price cycles. Obviously we're in a pretty deep -- pretty big dip here, which is outside of the normal price cycle volatility. But I think we're demonstrating that the balance sheet is handling that through this time frame. So that priority remains the same. And then I think the question and I talked about this in the Investor Day is how do you balance across those priorities in the short-term. And so today as we -- to face these very short-term challenging market headwinds, we are making sure that we're maintaining that dividend and continuing to advance the projects with the expectation that we'll see a recovery. Our revenues will rise, more cash will come in, which will allow us to continue to invest in those projects. And so that we're not making a trade-off on the medium to long-term but one in the short-term based on the needs of our investment base. And I would just tell you that we'll continue to strike that balance as we go forward. If this market evolves and we see changes in a recovery that's slower than what we have even anticipated recognizing we've been pretty conservative in our outlook, we'll have to step back and look to see if we need to make any further adjustments there. But my view is, if you don't have those investments, you're not providing the foundation to support that dividend. A lot of the projects that we've been putting in place, the capital we've been spending here over the last couple of years those projects are going to come online and start contributing cash. So I think we're going to begin to see here in the next year or so, a lot of the benefits associated with the investments we have been making and that will contribute to the cash and provide the basis to support the dividend. Neil Mehta : And then the follow-up -- thank you, Darren. Then the follow-up is just around the capital structure and the balance sheet. As you indicated in your slides, you've got a good balance sheet and your leverage ratios are lower than your peer set. But you have been taking on debt at a quite accelerated pace here over the last couple of years. Is there a governor that you look at and say we have -- we don't want to take on any more debt? And just talk about the importance and the strength of the balance sheet to you as you think about weighing those different priorities? Darren Woods : Sure. I would just maybe start first with the draw that we've had on the balance sheet. And I think the context to keep in mind as we've done that is what I would call as a restructuring of the business or bringing in high-margin profitable investments into the base to strengthen the structural capacity of the company. And so that's been an important priority for us and the reason why we've increased the investment is to make sure that we're building the capital base and the assets to be successful in the markets that we expect to be in here over the next decade. And so low cost, high-margin, oil barrels, high-performance products and chemicals to meet the growing demand there and configuration of key integrated refining assets to make sure that we've got the yield profile that's consistent with demands that society have. So those investments are pretty strategic and pretty foundation. And the idea was to structurally improve the business through those investments and so that has a priority. As we did that, we wanted to make sure that we maintain the capacity to manage the swings. And as you see today, we have that capacity. So we've managed that and met that objective. And then, as we look longer-term, what's the right level, our view is it has to be sustainable something that the business continue to bear and allow us to have continued, attractive and competitive access to the debt markets. And so making sure that we keep that in a range that allows us a good access and people continue to see us as a sound investment and basis for loaning money to its going to be important. So we try to keep all that balanced, recognizing that there are going to be short-term debt dips in that process. We feel right now where we're at pretty good around, where we've leveraged up to and the resources that we have available for us. We think we've got what we need to kind of manage through this year. Neil Mehta : All right. Thanks, Darren. Darren Woods : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah. Thank you and good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : I guess what I'd like to ask given the CapEx that you're doing, the ones the industry is doing the -- I guess what's called a selective shut-ins whether it's part of OPEC+ or price driven. What do you think the other side of this is, in terms of depletion rates? And the reason I asked is at the, follow-up breakfast after the investor event it was a very clear discussion from Exxon side that this 6% to 8% annual decline is out there. And the comment from those of us on the analyst investor side was we haven't seen it. So is this something that brings that more to the 4%? And how do you see that within Exxon's portfolio? Darren Woods : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. I think, that -- I don't think, you're going to see that change. When you say you haven't seen it our experience -- we're physically managing that every year. And so we're pretty confident in what the physics are associated with production of the oil and gas resources that we've got. What often maybe obscures the view is a lot of work programs that companies are doing to maintain and offset that decline which doesn't often -- they're not discrete projects so to speak so it's often hard to model those. But there is a lot of activity. In fact we do that, ourselves to offset that natural decline work. And that takes resources that takes capital and investment spend. So I think, what you're going to find, which I'm not sure if this is where your question was heading. But as you strip out some of that work and those programs to reduce activity to mitigate that decline, because the revenues aren't there to support it. I think you'll see that decline rate manifest itself more explicitly across the industry.  So my view would be you'll probably get a better visibility into that. It won't be a change per se around what naturally happens through production. It'll just be that the offsets aren't necessarily masking that underlying decline rate and then, just stepping back maybe more broadly to your question. I was at the Investor Day and I think as a company we continue to believe that the industry as a whole has been under investing for the demand that's going to be needed in the future. Obviously, what's happened here with the coronavirus and the drop in prices is going to pull a lot more capital out of the industry as you've seen -- as you've already seen which is going to exaggerate that issue. So I think on the back end of this thing we're going to find a market that eventually gets a lot shorter than we were already anticipating. Roger Read : Yeah. That's -- I think, that's the right direction. It's just been close to that. Thanks for that. Darren Woods : Welcome Roger. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Roger. Roger Read : I guess the next question, I'd like to go to on the Downstream obviously you've mentioned that things had improved or were improving in China. We'll see if that sustains. Within the U.S. and Europe, we've seen the first signs of some of the lockdowns come off. And I was just curious, if you had any kind of more immediate responses in terms of North American or European demand trends. Darren Woods : Yeah. No that's something we're keeping a really close eye on is, what are the tell signs in terms of what we see. And April was significantly lower demand month than what we saw in March. And so I kind of saw that, as the depth of the coronavirus impact. If you look at kind of going forward into May -- and what we're using in terms of looking -- trying to get a view of that looking forward is sales out of our retail assets around the world and using that to see how -- what kind of demand response for people primarily around road transportation. And we are seeing improvements really across all three markets. We've seen in May volumes trending up in Europe. We see that happening in the U.S. and we see that also in Asia, although, Asia didn't drop nearly as far as Europe or the U.S. And so there are some. I'd say encouraging early signs in the transportation sector particularly road transportation. I think on aviation that's probably going to take a little bit longer. We haven't seen any uptick in that space yet. Roger Read : Thank you. Darren Woods : You're welcome. Take care. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Darren. I hope everybody is doing well over there. And obviously, we appreciate all the comments you guys have been making about how you've adjusted your business to adapt to this situation we're in right now. I have two questions. They're really follow-ups I guess to what Neil, asked but I want to be a little bit more direct if I may. What are the circumstances, Darren, I think you've been pretty clear. You've obviously underlined the issue of the dividend. But what are the circumstances where you would ever envisage that Exxon Mobil would cut its dividend? Darren Woods : Well, good morning, Doug and everyone's fine here so thank you for asking. I hope the same is true with you. Look, you know -- I know you're looking for a very explicit answer. And all I would tell you is we think it's -- the dividend is an important part of the value proposition that we provide to our shareholders particularly given the base of our shareholders. It would depend on the circumstances that we see in the market and how prolonged we think those circumstances are going to exist. So, I mean, I would just tell you we're going to have to wait and see how the market plays itself out. If we find ourselves with some sustained structural deficit that says the business is going to have trouble over a much longer time period, we'd have to step back and rethink that. But frankly, we're not seeing that today. If you look at some of the early signs, I think, we see some encouragement in -- going into May. And so I think we're going to have to kind of play that by ear. The beauty of the dividend is it's flexible. We -- the Board considers that every quarter and we're obviously, looking at the macro environment looking at some of the -- kind of telltales that are out there. We've got our organization working very hard around what are some leading metrics that we can keep an eye on to see which direction things are going. And so we're going to continue to look at that and make decisions as we go forward to ensure that for the long-term, this business is strong and has a good foundation to provide continuing dividends out into the future and products that the world are going to need. Doug Leggate : I understand, it's a tough one to answer explicitly. I guess the perception out there is - rather Shell has given you cover -- given the industry cover for a wholesale reset. I just wanted to see if you could offer some perspective. But I appreciate you answering to the extent you have. Well my follow-up is just kind of -- go on sure. Darren Woods : Doug, let me just say, on that. Well, we're not -- I don't really look to what Shell is doing to decide our dividend policy frankly. It's a function of our investment base and the commitment that we've made to them. Doug Leggate : And the opportunity set for sure. My follow-up is kind of related. The credit agencies took, obviously, took you down a notch. You've obviously added that and presumably you shared with them what you were doing. Where -- is there a limit that you would be comfortable allowing the balance sheet to go? And again it's tender dividend related as well I guess. Your capital is flexible if the dividend is sacrosanct. Where does the balance sheet get to a level where you're not comfortable? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Darren Woods : Well, again I know you like real specific numbers. But I would just tell you one of the principles that we had in managing the balance sheet is to make sure that we maintain capacity because as we've just seen here this quarter the market's got a lot of volatility in it. And therefore, we need to have a foundation or a base that allows us to accommodate that volatility. And we need to have access -- competitive access to the market. So we're going to make sure that we stay in a range that allows us to competitively continue -- to competitively access the debt markets when we need them and make sure that we've got a buffer that allows us to run and continue to manage the ups and downs that are not going to away in this commodity-based business. So again it's an ongoing conversation something that the Board and I spent time talking about and looking at. And we're going to kind of continue to adjust it as we go forward. I mean, the priorities that I've laid out around the investment the dividends and the balance sheet -- and I used the term earlier this morning, I used it in our Investor Day balance. We got to kind of balance it based on what we see happening in the marketplace. We -- today we've taken a position that we believe balance in what we're seeing. As the quarter moves on if things don't play out the way we think or we see something that's structurally very different than what we anticipate, we'll look at rebalancing that. It's just difficult to tell right now frankly. Doug Leggate : Thanks, Darren. Good luck. Darren Woods : Good. Thank you, Doug. Take care. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Darren Woods : Good morning, Doug. Stephen Littleton : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : So Darren, you reiterated your business plan which you guys have had for a while that global prosperity would drive investment and that you guys would end up excelling versus your peers through advantaged investments. And on this point you kind of also indicated that your priorities for capital management aren't going to change, but the pace probably would. So my question is that do you think that we'd know already that there are going to be broad changes to Exxon Mobil and the industry's capital management program over the medium-term? And so what might be different -- meaning you just use the word balance to describe the approach. Do you think we need better balance or maybe more balance? And also how does consolidation play into all of this that is if you think it does given the distress that we're seeing in the energy markets today? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks Doug. Hope all is well with you. On the balancing, I think that balance is going to be a very I'll call it sector maybe company-specific point in terms of where everyone stands with respect to their balance sheet, with their capacity, their scale, their integration. So I think the balance will be different. And in my view some segments of our industry today needed better balance and I think that will manifest itself. I think there -- you got to be able to survive through these downturns and position your company to do that. So I do think there's a balance that's needed there. I also think that the demand will be there, because of the fundamental role it plays in economic growth in people's lives. And so as much as the short-term kind of swings the industry around, ultimately the demand for the products will come back and the industry is going to have to respond to that demand. And if in the short-term a lot more conservatism comes in, a lot less capital flows into the marketplace, we'll open up that supply/demand balance going forward and that will then incentivize things coming back in, and frankly, may lead to less balance in terms of what you're talking about. So I think it's really a function of the capacity and capability of companies to kind of weather through this short-term period. And I think some companies are better positioned to do that than others, which is -- probably leads you to your second point about consolidation. And I think again that opportunity exists particularly in periods like that. If you look back in time when prices get low and companies get stressed you see that tend to happen not only in our industry, but in other industries. So that's certainly a theme, which I think will resonate within the industry. Exactly how that plays itself out though I think we'll just have to wait and see. Doug Terreson : Yes. Let me ask you something else about that. I mean, it always -- there always seems to be the ability to have financial transactions work, but when you guys bought Mobil there was obviously lots of strategic merit to that combination and other combinations during that period as well. So do you think that we're in an environment where there is enough strategic merits, especially -- in combinations, especially for a company your size, or do you think it's different this time around? Darren Woods : I come back to a lot of the value levers that we saw with the Exxon Mobil merger. I mean, those value levers I don't think have really changed over time. And so it's really a question of what opportunities are out there where you can see some of those probably a subset of the value levers that we saw with that. And of course, as we look at opportunities -- I've been asked this a lot of times in these calls about acquisitions. And what I've always said is we have to look and find some unique value levers to justify the deal. And if you can't do that then there's no space for the deal. And that has really been I think the underlying criteria that we've had as we've looked at acquisitions as we continue to look at acquisitions and opportunities is can we find a way of creating and extracting unique value out of some acquisition or opportunity. And that's not going to change. We continue to look for those things. And if we find them\u2026 Doug Terreson : Thank you. Yes. Darren Woods : Hey, you bet. Thank you, Doug. Stephen Littleton : Thanks, Doug. Doug Terreson : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning everyone. My first question\u2026 Darren Woods : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first question maybe skipping gears real quick here is on the Permian. And you've invested meaningful capital in the Permian including on infrastructure spending. And your partners have indicated that the Wink-Webster pipeline has not been delayed. So is it fair to think that when Exxon eventually does resume some kind of higher level of overall corporate CapEx that the Permian would be the first call on growth capital from a returns perspective? And given the reduced CapEx in the Permian this year is there any infrastructure build-out that you need to address before you get back to your prior growth trajectory? I know you mentioned that the Line 1 of the Cowboy facility was complete. Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks Jeanine. So and Neil talked about this in our Investor Day as we looked at the range of flexibility that we had. And that was one of the points I think Neil tried to make was we -- even within in early March as we looked at our investments in the unconventional space that we did have opportunities to ramp down spend and investment there and still fully utilize the infrastructure that we are putting in place and making sure that we got a return on those investments. And frankly, it was pretty critical to do that and maintain scale and scale advantage in the cost. If you think more broadly about what we're trying to do in the Permian, it's really with this long supply market in mind that we've got to find a way to get the cost -- the unit cost of production in the Permian down. And the way we're approaching that is through scale and technology. We think that's absolutely critical. And so, our view is to make that investment in the Permian very competitive in an oversupplied market which I would tell you we're well on the way towards. And so, the cuts we've seen to date allow us to continue to preserve that capital efficiency. It allows us to do -- continue with the development, the cube developments to make sure we're maximizing the recovery, and it utilizes our above-surface facility. So I think that's where we're at today. And we're looking now -- and you saw in the presentation that Stephen gave with the second quarter outlook we are taking economic shut-ins in the Permian. And that's not a -- that's really a function of -- if you think about a lot of these wells that are early in their lives which just started up you get very high production rates. And from an economic -- maximizing the NPV of those wells, you're better off deferring that high production rate into a period with better pricing. And so a lot of the shut-ins that we're doing in the upstream are associated with kind of a value play around making sure that we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive to high production rates. And of course, looking forward, depending on how the market evolves, we've got the flexibility to bring a lot of those wells back on quickly and ramp up what we're doing in the unconventional space. So it is -- you all have talked about that. We've talked about it. That short-cycle investment gives us a lot of flexibility and we're certainly leveraging it. There's a lot of value there too. I would tell you, we continue to feel very good about the ability for that resource when we get it online to compete in a low-price environment. The challenge we've got today is the investment we're making to get in that position and that's kind of what's inhibiting us, but once we get into it we feel really good about operating competitively in an oversupplied market. Jeanine Wai : Thank you for the very comprehensive answer. My follow-up question is maybe following up on some of the other questions, but in a different way. Darren, you already have some pre-FID capital invested in attractive projects. And if we end up being in a prolonged oil price environment, at what point is it too detrimental to the long-term business to stay at the current CapEx level, since at some point you need to continue to invest in the business to grow the cash flow to sustain the dividend? And you mentioned earlier on the call, that there is an economic cost for slowing down some of these projects, but you still think that there's long-term fundamentals that are intact. Darren Woods : Yeah. I think Jeanine, we'll have to watch and see how the world evolves. I mean I keep coming back to -- and I know you guys probably feel like it's a repetitive statement, but the basic drivers of energy demand have not changed with what we're seeing today. The demand drivers the fact that energy plays such a critical role in people's everyday lives and the growth of economies mean that that energy will be needed. So it's really a question of timing and the recovery. And again, I think, we're -- April is probably the depth of the impact in our industry. I hope that's true. Certainly, it's looking that way from the early signs. But we're going to have to let this kind of quarter play out. I think the second quarter will be a challenging quarter, but we'll have a better view around how the rest of the year is shaping up and we'll continue to adjust it. We've got additional flexibility to use if we want to. And if we start to conclude that based on some structural change, which frankly it's hard to see right now, but if we see that we'll adjust the plans again. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you for the answer. Darren Woods : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : Thanks very much, gentlemen. I just wanted to see, if I could get you to elaborate a little bit further on the sources of the production curtailments that you're going to be undertaking over the course of the quarter. And are they primarily based upon the economics of the individual plays, or is some of this at the direction of host governments? Darren Woods : Yeah. No. I would say, the 400 koebd that we put in Stephen's second quarter look ahead. And I would tell you the way to think about that is about two-thirds of that roughly would be in the economic category and about half of that in Kearl, and then the other half in this economic steps that we're taking in the Permian, which is really around preserving value. Kearl with a low price environment I think it's more challenged from a competitive or cost of supply basis. Permian we get higher value by deferring some of those. And so, about a third -- out of Kearl, about a third in the unconventional space and then about a third associated with restrictions put on us by the governments around the world. Jason Gammel : Yeah. That's very useful. You actually somewhat pre-empted my follow-up question, which was going to note that the operational performance at Kearl has actually been quite strong. So, you're talking about the potential economic shut-ins that -- could you maybe elaborate a little bit more about any logistical issues that could constrain Kearl to coming back in the near term? Darren Woods : Sure. I know there's been a lot written about that. I would have to tell you, this has been again another really great benefit of the reorganizations that we've done along the value chain with our Upstream. We made the change in our Downstream, beginning of 2018. We made the change in the Upstream in April 2019. And so if you look today, as we headed into this, our ability to see end to end from the wellhead all the way down to the customers, I think was the best in industry frankly. Certainly, nobody had anything better in terms of that ability to see along. And so we were very early into that process making sure that we had a clear line of sight of how we would move the physicals and that we do not find logistics constraints. Of course, you know we've been investing in logistics both out of Canada and Kearl with takeaway capacity there on the rail and in type. And we've invested in the Permian and takeaway capacity there. And so we've got I think a good line of sight of where the bottlenecks are going to happen and really secure position with respect to the logistics to move the barrels. And we've applied -- our team has basically been keeping an eye on that around the world, not just out of those two resource plays, but everywhere that we lift barrel is making sure that we've got a clear line of sight of how we keep them flowing to the extent that the economics warrant that. So we have not seen the logistics constraints that others have talked about, just because of the fact that the organization was able to kind of see some of those coming and take the appropriate steps to make sure we didn't get caught with any of them. Jason Gammel : Very appreciate dealing with Upstream. Darren Woods : Operator, we probably have time for one more call. Operator : Okay. We'll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning, Darren. Thanks for taking the question. Darren Woods : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : So one of the, I guess bridges of the multiyear guidance was your asset sale plan. And I'm just wondering -- obviously this is a tougher environment for asset sales. So I guess, is it fair to assume that that lever -- the next one to two years might get pushed back a bit? And then in terms of the impact kind of shorter term on the balance sheet from that is that you need to -- with the lower prices you need to lean more in the balance sheet in the interim. So just curious how you think about toggling between those two items. And I guess, it does all kind of come back to the dividend question being asked. Is it -- if the asset sale bridge isn't there, do you look to the flexibility that dividend is something that can help? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes. Sure Phil. Good morning to you. I would say, you're absolutely -- the activity that we have, the focus that we have around restructuring the portfolio and high-grading that portfolio hasn't really changed, so the drivers and the motivation remain there. The work list that we have with respect to getting assets in the marketplace and the divestments are still in place. It's really a question of what we said all along is our ability to execute that divestment program will be a function of finding buyers who put a value on those assets, a value that's higher than what we see with them and so that we find a deal space and transact. And I think your point, which is a valid one and absolutely correct I think is going to be harder to do that in an environment like this where people are strapped of cash. So I would expect to see that divestment program slowed just because of the market dynamics and the buyer, seller -- the availability of buyers. And we're not counting on that with respect to how we think about the business and how we're going to fund the ongoing business. We have not assumed that we're going to benefit from asset sales. All of our plans are based on essentially managing with the portfolio that we have. Phil Gresh : Okay great. The second one I guess, this one is just around the quarter for Steve. In your 8-K, you gave obviously the guidance items around these inventory impacts and you also gave guidance around the derivative impacts on the Downstream side of the business. I think there's a little confusion on Downstream specifically with those derivative impacts. But could you just clarify the magnitude of that benefit that was baked into I think the margin bar in the bridge? Stephen Littleton : Yes. Phil, if you look at the margin factor included in that was the benefit of financial derivatives of about $1.3 billion or so plus or minus. And then obviously, that was offset by weaker refining margins. They brought it back down to about a $900-plus million benefit to the Downstream business. Phil Gresh : Okay. Great. Thank you. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Phil. Operator? Operator : At this time, I'll turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks. Stephen Littleton : Okay. Thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight first quarter results and the steps we're taking to not only manage through these challenging times, but to position ourselves for long-term growth in the eventual recovery. We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you and please be safe. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Before getting started, I wanted to say that I hope all of you on the call, your families and colleagues, are safe in light of the challenges our world continues to face. Joining me today is ExxonMobil Senior Vice President, Neil Chapman, who oversees our Upstream business. After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Neil will provide his perspectives and provide an update on the steps we're taking to navigate the current market environment and ensure we remain well positioned for the recovery. Following Neil's remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results, while Neil will be available to take your questions on broader themes, including the corporation's strategic priorities, progress on spending reductions, updates on major projects and views on market fundamentals. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I'll now highlight the developments since the first quarter of this year on the next slide.  In the Upstream, liquids realizations fell by about 50% compared to the first quarter as impacts from the coronavirus rippled through the global economy, significantly reducing demand. In response to the unprecedented market conditions, production was curtailed by approximately 330,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter. Despite considerable challenges, including global travel and supply chain disruptions, we were able to maintain strong operational performance in all of our businesses. We also progressed growth projects such as Guyana, with Phase 1 demonstrating nameplate production capacity, and we progressed Phase II FPSO topside integration in Singapore. In the Permian, the Delaware central processing and exporting facility started up, which enhances our integrated position in the basin through collection and processing of production from our Delaware Basin assets and enables efficient, lower-cost delivery to Gulf Coast markets. In the Downstream, refining margins decreased from first quarter levels and were 50% below 10-year annual lows, reflecting the significant reduction in demand and the resulting impact of increased levels of product inventory.  Refinery sparing was approximately 30% with reduced demand. However, utilization improved through the quarter as we saw early signs of recovery from the lows, including demand for road transportation fuels. Although bottom-of-cycle conditions persist in the Chemical business, margins were sustained at first quarter levels, with lower realizations being offset by lower feedstock costs. While COVID-19 impacted demand in the chemical industry, the impact across our portfolio was moderated by resilient demand in the packaging and hygiene segments.  At a corporate level, our people continue to support COVID-19 response efforts through our manufacturing operations and donations of critical products and resources, which Neil will highlight a bit later in the call. We also launched a collaboration with universities, environmental groups and other industry partners to find new and better ways to monitor and reduce methane emissions. The first of its kind effort called Project Astra is focused on developing an innovative sensor network in the Permian Basin to continuously monitor methane emissions across large areas to enable quick and efficient detection and repair of leaks, ultimately leading to lower emissions.  Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of second quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of second quarter results relative to the first quarter. Starting with first quarter 2020, the reported loss of $600 million included [unfavorable] [ph] identified items of $2.9 billion, driven mostly by noncash inventory adjustments. Excluding these items, first quarter earnings were $2.3 billion. Second quarter results included a $1.9 billion noncash benefit from inventory valuation, largely reversing the first quarter impact due to the improvement in commodity prices relative to the end of March and resulted in a second quarter U.S. GAAP loss of $1.1 billion. Excluding identified items, there was a $3 billion loss in the second quarter, down $5.3 billion from the first quarter driven by the effects of COVID-19, including the unprecedented decline in oil and product demand, resulting in significant declines in prices. These impacts were in line with the market factors that we previously communicated.  Within the quarter, April marked a low point, with results improving through May and June. However, it's worth noting refining margins remain very challenged, notably in North America with record high product inventories. Beyond the significant reduction in prices and margins, lower volumes in the quarter due to the demand impacts from the pandemic reduced earnings by $600 million. Lower operating expenses across all 3 of our businesses from reduced activity, lower overhead, logistics optimization and supply chain efficiencies improved earnings by $800 million. These efforts demonstrate the progress we've made towards our 15% cash OpEx savings target.  Moving to Slide 5. Upstream earnings, excluding identified items, decreased by approximately $3 billion, largely driven by lower prices, with liquids realizations down 50% and natural gas realizations down 25% versus the first quarter. Foreign exchange and other impacts reduced earnings by $360 million. Volume impacts were driven by timing of scheduled maintenance activity and lower European seasonal gas demand. Expenses were lower in the quarter with savings related to efficiencies and work processes, reduced unconventional and exploration activity and market-related savings, including lower contractor rates and lower rates on materials and supplies.  On the next slides, I will provide more details on volumes. Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter. Due to the challenging market conditions, we curtail production in unconventional and heavy oil assets starting in April. Additional government-mandated reductions were implemented in May. As previously mentioned, natural gas demand was seasonally lower, primarily in Europe. Scheduled maintenance, notably in our LNG portfolio, also contributed to lower volumes. Compared to the second quarter 2019, Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. In addition to the factors I just referenced, volumes were lower due mainly to the divestment of the Norway non-operated assets at the end of 2019. It's worth noting that half of the divestment impact was related to gas volumes. Finally, we saw continued liquids growth from our investments in the Permian, Abu Dhabi and Guyana, reflecting the continued value growth we are focused on.  Moving to Downstream on Slide 8. Earnings, excluding identified items, decreased approximately $2 billion relative to the first quarter. Lower margins and demand impacts driven by COVID-19 decreased earnings by nearly $2.6 billion, with refining capacity spared in line with significantly reduced demand. Included in the margin factor is the absence of first quarter's favorable mark-to-market impact of $1.1 billion and an unfavorable impact of approximately $200 million in the second quarter. This period-to-period impact was driven by significant volatility in the prices of the underlying commodities.  Our trading program is structured to maximize the value from our global asset base, leveraging our logistics and insights across the value chain. We are positioned to capture value as market disconnects occur, for example, by utilizing storage for crude and products when logistics capacity tightens. That said, trading and the use of financial derivatives to capture arbitrage opportunities can introduce additional volatility in our results due to the timing of recognizing [open] [ph] financial derivatives while not having the physical offset at the same time. Lower turnaround activity increased earnings by $190 million. Reduced expenses, including logistics efficiencies and lower contract rates, contributed another $220 million to the second quarter results.  Moving to the next slide, I will discuss downstream results relative to second quarter 2019. Earnings, excluding identified items, decreased approximately $1.1 billion versus the second quarter of 2019. The drivers are similar to what I just discussed, absent the significant mark-to-market effects associated with the swings in commodity prices. I would highlight the $0.5 billion contribution we saw year-over-year from lower turnaround activity and increased production of higher-value products as a result of the recent investments in our manufacturing facilities. Additionally, we continue to see the benefit of expense reductions and efficiencies discussed on the previous slide, which improved earnings by $340 million.  Moving to the next slide, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings, excluding identified items, decreased by just over $100 million. The margin impact quarter-to-quarter was flat, reflecting similar trends in feedstock cost and product realizations. While we benefited from resilient demand in the packaging and hygiene segments, COVID-19 had a more significant impact on our durables in the automotive sector, resulting in overall reduced volumes impacting earnings by $170 million. Consistent with what we saw across the corporation, reduced expenses, including impacts from turnaround and maintenance efficiencies and supply chain savings, improved Chemical earnings by $110 million in the quarter.  Turning to Slide 11. Chemical earnings, excluding identified items, increased by more than $150 million relative to the second quarter of 2019. While higher margins from lower fee costs improved earnings by $140 million, this is more than offset by lower volumes from COVID-19 impacts on demand. However, we saw dramatically lower expenses, improving earnings by nearly $250 million, with drivers consistent with what we saw on the prior slide.  The next slide highlights the strong progress we've made to date, reducing spend in response to the current market environment. Back in April, we announced that we will be reducing 2020 CapEx by 30% and cash operating expenses by 15%. Through the second quarter, we are on track to meet or exceed these targets. Cash operating costs in the second quarter were down about 15% relative to the first quarter, with reductions across all 3 of our businesses, as I previously mentioned. The cost reductions reflect decreased activity, maintenance and turnaround efficiencies, reduced contractor rates and lower structural costs from logistics optimization and supply chain efficiencies. As we optimize work processes, including how and where we perform work, we have identified structural opportunities that have lowered our costs.  In terms of our capital spend, second quarter was down 25% versus the first quarter. We are pacing investment in the near term while prioritizing capital optionality that preserves long-term value. Additionally, we have optimized project execution plans to further reduce spend. Our short-cycle investments, particularly in the Permian, provide us with optionality as the market recovers. We want to be well positioned to capture the eventual upswing.  Moving to Slide 13. Let me highlight steps we have taken to improve liquidity and ensure the corporation is well positioned to manage the current market environment. During the quarter, we leveraged our access to capital markets by issuing approximately $15 billion in debt, including approximately $5 billion of euro-denominated bonds. This issuance enabled us to capture attractive euro bond rates and diversify our fixed income investor base. The corporation's total liquidity has increased significantly since year-end 2019. As Neil will discuss in greater detail momentarily, we believe we now have sufficient capacity to weather the near-term market challenges and preserve our long-term growth plans and capital allocation priorities. Let's turn to the next page for a look at the second quarter cash profile. Second quarter cash flow from operating activities was in line with our projections of the COVID-19 impacts. There was an increase in working capital in the quarter driven by a seasonal reduction in payables and a continued inventory build coming out of the first quarter associated with a steep reduction in demand. Gross debt increased approximately $10 billion in the quarter, reflecting the steps I just mentioned to increase liquidity in light of the current market uncertainty. As a result, we ended the quarter with $12.6 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 15. I will cover a few key items for consideration with regards to our outlook for the third quarter. In the upstream, economic production curtailments are expected to average 60,000 oil equivalent barrels as market conditions have continued to show improvement. And we're forecasting an impact of 140,000 oil equivalent barrels with a full quarter of government-mandated curtailments in line with public announcements.  In the Downstream, we anticipate scheduled maintenance to be down slightly from the second quarter. However, as we reflect on the current business environment, including the high inventory levels, we would expect margins to remain very weak. In Chemical, we anticipate demand improvement in key durable and automotive sectors, partly offset by higher feed costs. Scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with the first quarter of this year. Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $800 million, and we expect continued spending reductions consistent with our announced targets.  With that, I will now turn the call over to Neil. Neil Chapman : Thanks, Stephen. It's great to be on the call this morning. I hope that all of you joining us and your families are safe and healthy, and I want to extend the gratitude of everyone here at ExxonMobil to all of the men and women working on the front lines to fight the virus and to help those suffering from its effects. I'd also like to thank our employees for all that they are doing to support the response efforts globally.  As we indicated during the first quarter, we anticipated the COVID pandemic and related economic shutdowns would significantly impact the financial performance of companies across multiple sectors in the second quarter, and we've seen that reflected in the results announced to date. As Stephen just discussed, the same external factors were evident in our second quarter earnings and cash flows. However, there's reason to be encouraged that we may have seen the trough in April when WTI hit a historic low point and then began to rebound as economic activity picked up and demand showed signs of increasing. By the end of the quarter, WTI had risen to around $40 per barrel, with Brent trading slightly above that, and oil prices have remained relatively stable at that level in recent weeks.  I'd like to begin with a few overarching comments on one of the most challenging quarters this industry has seen. We have acted quickly and decisively while preserving long-term value. The organization has responded with a level of commitment and professionalism that has been exceptional. We rapidly adjusted our plans and asked the organization to deliver on very aggressive new targets. They have delivered. Through all of the challenges this environment has presented, we have safely maintained the integrity and continuity of our operations while also making the necessary adjustments to COVID-19 to provide a safe work environment for our workforce and support global response efforts. This success should not be underestimated. Essentially all of our global facilities, Upstream, Downstream and Chemical, have operated without interruption. You can imagine the challenge of maintaining a virus-free environment on offshore platforms and refineries, where our workforce live and work in close proximity. We've had to charge planes to move our rotating operating staff all over the globe without the availability of commercial planes. We've had to lease hotels in multiple cities to quarantine our folks before they start their 30-day rotations. Our organization's ingenuity has been remarkable. We've responded quickly to the rapidly changing price and margin environment by shutting in facilities when necessary and capturing value from the rapidly changing prices, leveraging our extensive supply chains around the world. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made reducing costs and pacing investments to adjust to the market conditions. As Stephen described, we set very aggressive operating and capital expense targets. The organization is exceeding those targets, which positions us very well for the rest of the year. We ended the quarter with more than $12.5 billion of cash, which is in line with the business needs. Given this level of liquidity, we don't see a need to take on additional debt.  Before I dive into the business, I want to highlight some of the amazing work our people have done in response to the COVID pandemic. These efforts included reconfiguring manufacturing operations, optimizing processes and delivery systems, enabling us to increase production of essential chemicals that are critical to the world's medical response, including isopropyl alcohol for hand sanitizer and specialty polypropylene for masks and medical garments. Our people have stepped up to contribute educational supplies to schools, fuel and PPE for first responders and financial support to food banks and many other related causes. If you haven't already, I encourage you to visit our website to see all of the inspiring ways our employees have contributed during this time of need. Now I'll turn to what we're seeing in the markets. Consistent with oil prices reaching historic lows, our own retail sales reflect a bottoming of transportation fuel demand in April, followed by some encouraging signs of recovery. The shape of the recovery varies by region, though the demand in Asia recently surpassed where it was a year ago. This data is from the International Energy Agency. What we saw was a historic demand contraction for transportation fuels with countries around the world impacted at nearly the same time, but we are seeing a recovery from the recent lows. Reflecting the improving demand trends we're seeing, the IEA's view of the next 18 months is similar to ours. They're forecasting a rebound in road transportation fuels, with fourth quarter 2020 demand expected to be at similar levels to the fourth quarter of the prior year. The recovery in jet fuel demand is likely to be much slower with by far the sharpest reduction in demand and the slowest recovery expected. As you would expect, the impact of lower demand was apparent in the second quarter, the refinery crude throughput, about 15% below 2019 levels. This resulted in pressure on margins, which Stephen discussed a few moments ago. Looking more broadly at total liquids demand, the second quarter was down about 20% year-on-year, but it's important to note the actual loss of demand was not as severe as some had expected, considering the low end of the range was about 30%. Simply put, the demand distraction in the second quarter was unprecedented in the history of modern oil markets. To put it in context, absolute demand fell to levels we haven't seen in nearly 20 years. We've never seen a decline in this magnitude and pace before, even relative to the historic periods of demand volatility following the global financial crisis and as far back as the 1970s oil and energy crisis. In response to this lower demand, we saw a similarly unprecedented reduction of supply in the second quarter as OPEC+ was down approximately 11 million barrels a day in May and June. North American production shut-ins are estimated to have peaked at more than 2 million barrels per day. However, in line with the extraordinary drop we saw in demand, inventory levels increased to unprecedented levels, and we anticipate it will be well into 2021 before the overhang is cleared and we return to pre-pandemic levels.  As mentioned, clearly, the industry has taken significant steps to reduce production. We have taken decisive action in this regard as well. Curtailment impacts in the quarter were about 330,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Roughly 2/3 of these volumes were economic curtailments in unconventional and heavy oil. We brought the majority of production from our shorter-cycle unconventional plays back online in July as market conditions recovered. For our heavy oil assets, we took advantage of the economic curtailments to pull forward planned maintenance. At Kearl, we completed a maintenance shutdown on line 2, and it's now back online. In the middle of July, we shut down line 1 for similar planned maintenance, and this is expected to return to service in late August. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate an impact of approximately 200,000 oil equivalent barrels per day from curtailments, with about 70% of those mandated by governments.  Turning to the Permian Basin. Second quarter production was nearly 300,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. That's a 9% increase versus the second quarter of 2019. We continue to anticipate 2020 production will be about 345,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. It's down just 15,000 barrels per day from what we discussed back in March despite the curtailments and the sharp reduction in capital expenditure and still more than 70,000 barrels per day above the full year of 2019. During the quarter, we started up the Delaware Basin central processing and exporting facility, which we refer to as Cowboy. As I discussed in March, this is a key building block in our Poker Lake major development. As we've discussed previously, the short-cycle nature of our Permian assets also provides flexibility to pace development, reduce spend and preserve cash in the current environment. We cut our rig count by about half, ending the quarter with 30 rigs in the Permian Basin, and we expect to cut that number by at least half again by the end of this year. Our activities for the rest of the year will be focused on Poker Lake, where we will continue to leverage our development scale advantage and utilize the above-surface investments that we have pursued in the last 18 months, including Cowboy.  In light of the recent low price environment, we also pushed out the flowback of our largest to date cube development to the third quarter. This is the 27 well cube in the Midland Basin that I referenced at our Investor Day. Again, this decision reflects our focus on making the appropriate decisions to maximize the value of each well and adapt as market conditions become more favorable, including optimize completion timing for our inventory of drilled uncomplete wells.  In Guyana, Liza Phase 1 demonstrated production capacity of 120,000 barrels per day during the quarter. The response to a mechanical issue that we experienced in May was slowed by logistical challenges of mobilizing technical experts and materials in-country due to COVID restrictions. So these are close to being resolved, and we expect to get back to full capacity with 100% gas injection in August.  We're still actively investing for the future in Guyana, with 4 drilling rigs as of the end of June with 1 on exploration and 3 on appraisal and project development drilling. Subsequent to the quarter end, drilling at Yellowtail 2 identified 2 additional high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, 1 adjacent and 1 below the Yellowtail field. Liza Phase 2 remains on schedule for a 2022 start-up. You can see the FPSO in the photo, which is currently in Singapore for the top site integration.  We are continuing to work with the government on approval for the Payara development plan. Without final resolution of the election results and signing in a new government, there is a potential for delays to the schedule. Having said that, it's very clear that all parties in-country understand the importance of progressing the developments quickly given the significant benefits to all stakeholders, especially the citizens of Guyana.  Let's now turn to the progress we're making on the aggressive cost reduction measures we put in place earlier this year, starting with capital expenditures. In April, we reduced our plan for this year by 30% to $23 billion. We're on pace to meet or exceed that target. In fact, our annualized run rate in the fourth quarter is expected to be around $19 billion, and we expect to be lower still in 2021. Savings during the second quarter were primarily driven by short-cycle unconventional activity, but I should note that we're also adjusting the pace of other investments in all of our businesses. As we previously mentioned, we continue to take a very thoughtful and comprehensive approach to these cost reductions in partnership with our contractors, partners and governments. You will hear me say several times this morning the importance of addressing the short-term market challenges while conserving cash and preserving long-term value and future optionality. This helps us ensure that while investments may be deferred in some areas, the opportunities remain. Given the continued uncertainty and volatility, we will continue to adjust CapEx reductions as needed while also being mindful that the pullback we're seeing across the industry today could very well lay the foundation for supply challenges in the future, and we want to make sure we're positioned to capture the eventual upswing.  In addition to our targeted near-term CapEx reductions, we also laid out plans to reduce cash operating expenses by 15% in 2020. Again, we are delivering. We're ahead of pace to achieve that target, with savings coming from a wide range of activities including lower unconventional activity, optimizing supply chains, lower material and service costs and work process improvements to reduce support and overhead costs. So these are just a few examples. Our savings are widespread across the corporation. More importantly, we're doing it without compromising safety or operational integrity.  Over the past few years, we underwent a reorganization of our businesses from what were primarily functional organization structures to aligning a long value chain. These reorganizations reduce the senior leadership structure and associated overhead and improved the line of sight across the value chains to better drive performance from our assets. At our Investor Day in March, we discussed how this organization has provided a new lens on the business to identify and improve ways to drive further efficiencies. You might recall, Darren made the point that our plan for this year included reducing our operating cost on our base assets by more than $1 billion, and he said that we would do even better in 2021. So we came into the current environment in a good position to respond quickly. We're confident that we will meet or exceed our cost reduction targets for 2020. Looking ahead to 2021, we see significant potential for additional reductions based on identification of further long-term structural efficiencies, reduced activity levels and an evaluation of our workforce requirements, including the potential for further reductions in overhead and management positions. Our plan is to continue looking at reductions business by business and country by country. Consistent with our annual budgeting process, we're working through these plans, and we would expect to have them finalized during the second half of the year and share them with you early next year.  Let me now address capital allocation. Our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. In a depletion commodity business, you have to invest in accretive advantaged projects to sustain a strong foundation to generate cash flows into the future. In a capital-intensive cyclical business, such as ours, it is critically important to maintain a strong balance sheet. This enables us to sustain through the commodity price cycle and be flexible when opportunities present themselves. It has been a strength of this corporation for decades, and it is an advantage that we will maintain. Finally, we have a long history of providing a reliable and growing dividend. A large portion of our shareholder base has come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income, and we take that very seriously. While we manage our capital allocation priorities over the long term, we also recognize the need to balance in the near term to respond to market conditions. In response to the unprecedented environment that we find ourselves in, we've taken decisive action in 2020.  To recap what we've done so far this year. We've reduced short-term capital spending by more than 30%. We're on pace to reduce cash operating expenses by more than 15%. We've increased debt to a level we feel as appropriate to provide liquidity, given market uncertainties, and we will hold it at that level. And we're continuing to pay a reliable dividend.  Given the ongoing uncertainty in the business environment, we're developing plans that will enable us to maintain our capital allocation priorities over the near term. These plans contemplate a price environment that is consistent with the range of third-party estimates and in line with the shape of the recovery that I discussed moments ago. The plans will include further reducing operating expenses and identifying additional opportunities to efficiently defer more CapEx. Doing so will enable us to maintain the dividend and hold debt at its current level. Of course, this is a volatile market, and we can't know with certainty how the market will evolve from here. There are simply too many unknowns. While we're developing plans based on what we and other third parties can reasonably expect to happen, we have to maintain a certain degree of flexibility to be able to respond to potential improvement or further degradation. Before we open up the call for questions, I want to reemphasize a few key points. Our people continue to demonstrate a commitment to safety and operational integrity and continuity in an incredibly challenging environment. Our company continues to benefit from the integration advantages we've built across the value chain. We remain focused on driving down costs and pacing investments to manage the near-term market challenges. We've maintained financial capacity in line with our business needs and the market environment. We will continue to be there for the communities and frontline workers who depend on the products and support we can provide to combat the ongoing pandemic. I am confident in our organization and our plans. We will overcome the challenges of the current environment just as we've overcome many challenges in the past.  Thank you, and we look forward to taking your questions. Stephen Littleton : Thank you for your comments, Neil. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : My first question is on the debt. And in terms of the commentary that Exxon doesn't need to take on any additional debt, it implies a price and CapEx assumption. Can you provide a little more color on what your price assumption is? And what range of demand scenarios would you look at compared to what you laid out in the presentation, which was really helpful? Just wondering also if the message is that Exxon will adjust CapEx through the price environment regardless of what the impact on production is in order to just pull the line on that debt. Neil Chapman : Yes, this is Neil. Thanks for joining the call. Good to hear from you. Of course, as you are aware, in the response to this environment, which clearly has been unprecedented, we've never seen the market demand crash so far, so deep. We've never seen prices and margins crash so much, and that's why having a strong balance sheet is so important. And I would tell you, that's why the financial discipline of this corporation over many, many decades has been so critical. It means you can weather the big storms. It means you can weather the large-scale disruptions. And of course, it also means you can reward the loyalty of our shareholders by sticking with them when the business recovers and sticking with the plans we have in place to protect this balance sheet and maintain our dividend. As we've just been discussing or describing, we took really, really decisive steps for this year, so the short-term capital spending reduction of 30% to 15% in operating expenses. This is very much in line with what we saw in our April earnings call. You will recall that Darren laid out our plans then. What we said we needed to do at that time, we've done. The results are on track and are in line with our expectations. So we set out the plans for this year with these reductions. We're now developing plans that are going to enable us to maintain our capital allocation priorities over the near term, and these plans contemplate a price environment that's generally consistent with third parties. Of course, we've seen the third-party assessment of the price environment going forward converge, and we're in line with those. Our plans to maintain our debt at the current levels and maintain our dividend include further reductions in operating expenses, and we're working hard to identify additional opportunities to what I always describe as efficiently deferring more CapEx, and that preserves the optionality and the future value that responds to these short-term needs. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. My follow-up, I guess, just on the further CapEx reductions that you mentioned. If oil prices are modest and you're looking to any potential delays from more projects, you've mentioned in the past that there's always a cost associated with delaying those projects. And so can you just address that? And what kind of projects you might think like the opportunities to defer? I know the run rate of $19 billion that you're talking about is significantly lower than the 2020 budget. On the flip side of things, given the project backlog, at what point does M&A become a more attractive option in sort of delaying things as a means to kind of grow the medium- and long-term cash flows? Neil Chapman : Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. Well, we remain committed to progressing the structural improvements to our earnings and the cash flow that we've laid out for the last 3 years, but we have to be more selective in pacing those investments in light of the market environment. And of course and as we've described and actually Darren described as well in April, we've completed a thorough review of all of our ongoing investments and our ongoing investment opportunities. But in our business, that means you got to work with the resource owners, you've got to work with the partners, you've got to work with the stakeholders. We've got to identify areas where we can defer spending but conserve cash in the near term and, of course, preserve that long-term value.  What we have done, and I think we've done really successfully, is we've identified market efficiencies, we have identified project synergies that will offset the cost of these deferrals. But there will be impacts. I mean that's for sure. And there will be impact mainly in timing, and that's to the earnings and cash flow potential that we've previously communicated. So it's clear, I think, from our comments and our actions. In the short term, we'll defend the balance sheet, and we'll protect the dividend by taking short-term postponements in capital investments.  In terms of what we will do next year, of course, we're working through that now, and that's part of our annual planning process. And we're working through that now. And as you're well aware, our planned process concludes with a review with our Board of Directors in November. That will be the same this year as it is every year. And when we have clarity on what that capital spend will be next year, of course, we will communicate it to you. As I have mentioned in my comments, my expectation is our capital spending next year will be lower than the fourth quarter run rate.  In terms of M&A and could that provide a different option to -- I mean, Jeanine, of course, we're looking at that all time. We're looking all the time. And if the right opportunity comes up, then we may elect to move on that. But what I would say is, and I said this before and I certainly said it at the Investor Day, we have, I would say, the very richest set of competitive investment opportunities within this company already. I mean I don't think there's a company out there that can compete with that, and so there's no need for us to do an M&A. We don't need to do that. We have very, very attractive investments to make, but we always look at that option. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby with UBS. We'll move on for now to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Douglas Leggate : Can you all hear me okay? Stephen Littleton : Sure can, Doug. Neil Chapman : Yes, we can, Doug. Douglas Leggate : So a lot of questions. I'll stick with two. Neil, you talked about your run rate CapEx being $19 billion in the second half and below that in 2021, and you are still growing the Permian, and you're still executing Guyana. Can you then confirm that, that would still include growth capital? And what I'm trying to get to is some idea of what ExxonMobil sustaining capital is, in other words, ex growth, if you can help me with that. Neil Chapman : Yes. Thanks, Doug. Just to clarify one point. Our run rate of $19 billion is in the fourth quarter, not the second half, just so you're aware. And what I said is I expect, Doug, it will be lower. We will fund all the Guyana opportunities as they come forward. Of course, as we look at our capital spend, we're looking hard at the priorities on them. And Guyana, we will continue to fund, and you're well aware that Liza 2 is in construction. I'm confident we'll move on Payara as well.  In terms of the Permian, one of the great attractions of short cycle is you can take that capital off quickly. And of course, you can put it back on pretty quickly as well. Our current planning is that we will continue to reduce the number of rigs we have out in the Permian through the second half of this year. I think we are about, if I remember the numbers, about 30 rigs in the Permian at the end of the third quarter -- at the end of the second quarter. I would anticipate we'll be in the range of 15, maybe 10 to 15 at the end of the year, and that really is just a short term to manage our current capital planning.  Those rigs that we have in the Permian will be focused on that Poker Lake development. So what we're doing is we're concentrating, we're concentrating our developments in the Permian in that core activity in Poker Lake that we've talked about for the last 2 times, the last 2 Investor Days.  I would tell you in terms of ongoing sustaining capital, I'm always reluctant in our business to put a number to that because as your portfolio changes and as you make divestments, it's not a number to lock in, and I'm really, really reluctant to put a number on that. I would tell you it's somewhat easier in the Chemicals and Downstream businesses. I mean I think an order of magnitude on sustaining capital in those businesses will be in the $2 billion to $4 billion range. But I think in the Upstream, it's more difficult to quantify in that way. Douglas Leggate : I understand this is tricky, and I appreciate at least framing the answer. Gosh, I'm going to go to Guyana, if I may, on my second question. You used an interesting term of phrase, there is a potential for a delay. And if I preface my question like this, our understanding is that the Payara hole is well ahead of schedule. [indiscernible] I believe in Indonesia right now, there or thereabouts. My understanding is also that Bayphase has not yet finished its review of the development. And although we do not yet have a government, everything seems to be ahead of schedule. So what exactly are you signaling on Payara in terms of the risk or the potential for delay? Neil Chapman : Well, Doug, it's really very simple. Everything we and the partners can do to progress Payara on schedule, we are doing and we've done. I've said to our organization many times, we need to be ready to move as soon as the government is ready. And we are ready. We're ready to FID this project, but we need an approved development plan, and that approved development plan needs to come from the government. And all the work with Bayphase and on the development plan, that's been worked for a long, long time. Of course, we're waiting for a resolution, like everybody else, of the election. And I think you're very familiar with what's happened down there. There was a vote, there was the recount and then there's been a series of legal actions that have taken place since that time.  What we know is that all parties in Guyana want to progress this development. Of course, we're in regular contact with both President Granger and the APNU+AFC coalition, and we're also in discussions with the PPP and Jagdeo and Irfan Ali. And what we continue to stress to the government is that if the project does get delayed, it's a loss of value to the country, and they understand that. It's very, very clear the government understands that. It's very, very clear, the Ministry of Energy understands that. It's very important that we get this development plan so that we can FID in the September time frame. There are weather conditions that if you meet -- miss a certain window, it could result in delay of some months, and that's what we're trying to work towards. I'm confident this will get resolved, but Doug, it's -- we need that approval of the development plan, and that's what governments have to do. And obviously, we'll work with them. And as I said, we're ready to go. Douglas Leggate : And thanks for the restatement on the dividend. Neil Chapman : Yes, yes. And I appreciate it. Good to hear from you, Doug. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : The first question I had was around the dividend. And I think, Neil, your comments there was -- this is an imperative for you guys to defend. Can you just talk about the business logic and the financial logic behind defending the dividend, especially in light of some of the dividend reductions we've seen and are likely to be upcoming from your competitors? Neil Chapman : Yes. I mean we see it this way. And Neil, I'd tell you our capital allocation priorities, as I said in my prepared comments, they're unchanged, and I don't think you'd expect anything different. I always see the 3 legs of a stool. It's a commodity business, so you've got to invest in advantaged projects. You've got to invest in accretive projects. That's the way to sustain a strong foundation and to generate future cash flows.  But of course, the business is cyclical. We know that. It's volatile. We all know that. That's the norm, and therefore, it's important to maintain a strong balance sheet. And that's what we've done for years. It enables us to sustain through the commodity cycle. It enabled us to work through this quarter. And that's really, really important.  But third, we have a long history in this corporation of providing this reliable, and I would tell you, and as you know, growing dividend for 37 years. A large portion of our shareholder base, I mean, Stephen may correct me, but I think something like 70% of our shareholder base of retail investors. Stephen Littleton : That's correct. Neil Chapman : And the investor sets come to view that dividend as a source of stability in their income, and that's something we take really, really seriously. So we manage this capital allocation priorities over a long term. But obviously, it's a balance. And obviously, we recognize the need to balance in the near term to respond to what we've seen in these market conditions and market environment. And that's why we've had the cuts in CapEx and OpEx, and that's why we took on more debt in the last 4 months to a level that we feel is appropriate to provide liquidity, given the uncertainties of the market. But as I said, we don't plan to take on any more debt. We're now developing plans that will able us to maintain those capital allocation priorities over the near term, and that includes sustaining the dividend. And our plans contemplate a price environment that's consistent with third parties. Of course, we look at sensitivities on the upside and the downside of that, and we are aware of what those will be. And that is why we are moving on further reduction of operating expenses and further short-term, short-term reductions in capital expenditure. That will enable us to maintain the dividend, and that will enable us to hold our debt to current levels.  Now, Neil, I mean you're well aware, we can't know with certainty how the market will evolve from here. There's too many unknowns, of course. So you have to maintain a degree of flexibility to be able to respond should the recovery not play out as expected. But I -- we feel very confident that we will be able to maintain that level of debt and maintain that dividend, certainly for the coming year or months. Neil Mehta : Great. And I'm sorry to keep on going back to the capital spending question. I did think that is an incremental point of disclosure, so I just want to clarify some things here. So Neil, are you saying that at the end of the year, your fourth quarter annualized headline CapEx, not cash CapEx, will be $19 billion? And then in 2021, you anticipate you will be below that, all else equal right now? And then can you just talk about the buckets where you could see some downside relative to the plan that you had outlined? Neil Chapman : Yes. Yes. Well, you are correct. That is what I said. In the fourth quarter, we expect to be at an annual running rate of $19 billion. And what I said was, I expect, I anticipate we'll be lower than that $19 billion in 2021. Of course, we have an annual plan process. That's the way we work in this company. And we ultimately review that plan with our Board of Directors in November, and that will be finalized. And that's why I'm always saying I expect we will do that. We'll finalize the plan ultimately with the directors, and we'll communicate that to you at that time.  I think in terms of where we're taking those cuts, clearly, the short cycle in the unconventional space is the way you can turn on capital and turn off capital relatively quickly. And so the quickest cuts and the largest cuts we've made, as we've discussed, has been in the unconventional space, not just in the Permian. I tell you it is across all the unconventional space, and that will continue.  In the Downstream and Chemical projects, it's really a question of deferral. So we're not stopping any of these projects. We're deferring them. We're postponing them. And we're working with our partners, and we're working with EPC contractors, and we're working with local authorities. And that is why we've not been specific at this stage which project we're deferring over what period and when. When we have clarity with all of our partners, of course, we will share that with you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Douglas Terreson : Neil, economic value-added or EVA for ExxonMobil, and really every super major peer has declined steadily during the past decade or so even though we've had a range of commodity prices and margins. And we're now seeing the stocks of the super majors falling to 3- and 4-decade lows versus S&P 500. And on this point, one read could be that companies are investing cyclically or countercyclically, which I think is you all's view despite secular deteriorating -- or deterioration in competitive conditions that is a decline in value creation that we've seen.  So two questions. First question is, how do you think about the secular/cyclical risk part and the implications for spending? And then second, with ExxonMobil stock at a 40-year low versus S&P 500, why wouldn't this argue for additional transformation of the company's business structure, financial metrics, executive pay incentives or whatever you think is important? Or do you think that the current plan is sufficient and it will eventually accomplish the objective? So what's the market missing here? Neil Chapman : We can discuss this for a long time, Doug. So I'll try and be succinct. Look, in terms of how do we think about this business, we don't think the long term has changed. It is a cyclical business. The fundamentals are not -- have not changed. The population will continue to grow. Economies will continue to grow. This relationship between societal progress or you can describe it as human development and energy consumption is absolutely clear, and the demand for energy by all third parties is going to be up 25% by 2040. So we don't see that's changed.  And in our business, of course, which is a depletion business, it's not just a question of the growth in demand. It's the depletion as well, which, as you know, demand for crude oil -- and again, I apologize, I don't know these numbers exactly right. It's about 0.7% annual growth, and gas is probably 1.3%, but the depletion is about 6%. So there is a need for hydrocarbons to come into the market and people to invest in hydrocarbons to meet that energy demand. And the winner, the winner will be the company with the strongest portfolio and the company with the strongest operating results. And that's what we've been discussing at our last, however many, 3 investor meetings. And of course, we've talked about and be very, very quick, we've got the strongest set of development opportunities in the Upstream, and we've got the most -- we've got one of the most aggressive divestment programs, and we're driving costs out of the business. In the Downstream, we're not focused on growing fuels, we're focused on upgrading fuels, basically to distillate with diesel jet fuel and base stocks to meet that market demand. And of course in Chemicals, chemical demand, which is growing fast, is driven by this growth in middle class, and we feel very well positioned in that business. So I don't see anything changing. There's no evidence that anything is changing to any of that. I mean that is for sure. In terms of what do we need to do and should we be doing more, I would tell you, Doug, that's what we're focused on. You only win in this commodity business if you have the lowest cost structure, and driving costs out of your business and upgrading your portfolio is what this business is all about.  In terms of some of the comments around executive compensation and in terms of workforce reduction, of course, we're looking at every element of that, as you would imagine, when we go through a quarter like that. But I would tell you, we were already looking at all of this, and we started that process as we reorganized this company back in, I guess, 2018 and 2019 with our big changes in organization structure in both the Upstream and Downstream. So I would tell you, in my opinion, we're looking for structural efficiencies to improve this portfolio to be the most competitive in an industry and in a business where we believe the long-term fundamentals are not changed, and we don't see any evidence that changed at this stage. Stephen Littleton : I guess, Neil, the comment I'd add, as we did the restructuring in the 2 businesses along the value chain construct, what we're able to really identify is the overall cost of delivery of our products. And we're identifying efficiencies across those -- that entire value chain at a rate far higher than we really anticipated, and that's where we're going to start to see additional efficiencies going forward. Neil Chapman : Yes. Yes, Stephen is right, Doug. And I would tell you that this evaluation that we're going through as part of this year's plan to set up our cost structure for future years, '21 and beyond, we are looking at very significant efficiencies and lower operating expenses. And I know you're going to ask me, \"Okay, what is the number?\" That is part of our planned process. So we'll share with you at the end of the -- you know what I'm going to say, Doug. But as I said in my comments, we do see the potential for further workforce reductions, including overhead and management positions, but we'll look at that reductions by function, by business, by country, and that will be the basis. We will conclude those plans during the summer months, and we'll review that with the Board in November. Douglas Terreson : Okay. So it sounds like we'll hear about kind of an updated plan for potential or normalized earnings that you've provided in the past maybe next spring. Is that a good way to think about it? Neil Chapman : Yes, that would be our intent. Yes, that's exactly right. Exactly right. Operator : We'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Can you hear me? Neil Chapman : Yes, sure. Roger Read : I'd like to maybe come at the CapEx question a little different way. Bear with me a second. But as we think about what happened in the post-2014 CapEx cuts, we saw a tremendous amount of improvement in productivity and efficiency and cost reductions just from your contractor/subcontractor universe. Doesn't look like there's the same level of cost cuts that come out on that particular part. So as I think about a CapEx cut from the roughly $30 billion to the sub-$20 billion range, you've mentioned deferrals, but are we going to see a more significant impact on whether it's Exxon or the industry in terms of the ability to bring new oil and gas projects to market as maybe the main result here? I guess what I'm trying to think of is, is this one going to have -- this particular downturn going to have a bigger impact on the industry's deliverability? You kind of touched on that on the intro beyond, just interested in getting your thoughts on that. Neil Chapman : Yes. Well, I think, look, it is -- when you look across the industry, and we read the same reports that you do, and there's been a dramatic cutback in our industry on capital expenditure. And history says there is a result of that. This is a depletion business. I mean we all know what happens when you don't invest in this business, it certainly suggests that will be the case this time around. But obviously, I can only really talk about what we are doing and why.  We're taking these short-term steps while preserving the long-term value. That is our objective. I would tell you that we are working very hard with the contractors, the material suppliers on every angle to drive further efficiencies and costs out. The contracting industry is hungry because there's been so much CapEx taken out of the business, and people have suspended and postponed so many projects. So we're working very, very hard. And I have to tell you, in the Downstream, Chemicals and Upstream, I am -- well, first of all, I'm really pleased how well the EPC contractors are working with us. It is a great -- it illustrates the great partnership we have with them. And jointly, we're taking efficiencies, and we're offsetting the cost of these deferrals with increased efficiencies. That's what I am seeing, and that's what we're seeing in the business.  In terms of ability, where the industry stops investing, will that impact the long term of the ability to step up and reinvest again? There's always that chance. But experience in a commodity business suggests that when the demand is there, the market will deliver. I don't see any difference here. I am very optimistic, though, that as a result of not just the oil crash in '15, '16, but what we've seen today will fundamentally, will fundamentally push this industry to do things more efficiently and take structural costs out of construction in a way that we have not previously seen. Roger Read : Okay. So that's all... Neil Chapman : I don't know if that answered your question, Roger. Roger Read : I think so. I mean it's always amazing to me just how much productivity and efficiency comes out of the industry whichever the cycle, but especially in these down cycle moments. Neil Chapman : Yes. And I would tell you, as a business owner, Roger, it's unbelievably frustrating, right? Because we should gain these efficiencies in the base case. So -- but I agree with you. When times get like this, then it's extraordinary how the industry can find opportunities to do things more efficiently and take more cost out. Sorry, I interrupted your second question. Roger Read : No, no, that's quite all right. Second question, shifting gears a little bit back to Guyana that Doug mentioned earlier. Between your partner having their call in this call today in a nearby country, there was another discovery in the deeper zones. Your partner talked about some of the deeper zones. I was just wondering how are you looking at that opportunity and how that fits within the sort of greater than $8 billion of discovered resource so far? Where does it fit in the overall package? What did the Yellowtail-2 really tell you about that and some of the other opportunities? Neil Chapman : Yes. Well, I think you're probably aware, our latest appraisal well, which was on a prospect we call Yellowtail-2 and we discovered 2. I would tell you that additional high-quality, hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, and that it's very positive for us, and it's very positive for the country and our partners. One was adjacent to Yellowtail and one was below Yellowtail. So that further gives us great confidence and it's more learnings in terms of the potential at lower depths or deeper depths. We're now on a prospect called Redtail. I would anticipate we'll get some initial results in August on Redtail. We're going to move into the Kaieteur Block in August on a prospect called Canje. And of course, subsequent to that, we've got other exploration projects that we're drilling up in later this year, one in Hassa-1 and one in Bulletwood, which is on the Canje Block. If my memory is correct, those are what we're doing.  In terms of Suriname, I think you're aware, we're in Block 59 down there, and we're in Block 52 with our partner, Petronas. And we're looking to drill a well on Block 52 with our partner potentially in the fourth quarter of this year. I think the learnings and the understanding of the whole resource base in that offshore areas, Suriname and Guyana, the more we find and the more we drill, the more we understand about that hole prospects. But I would tell you that everything we've seen this year is consistent with what we've been talking about. And we are very encouraged and very excited by the prospects going forward. Operator : Next, we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : So belabor the CapEx topic, but something that I think we landed on that's pretty important, especially for investors. In the past, the process of budgeting CapEx was never explicitly tied to your expected sources of cash. And actually, as a matter of fact, the management committee would make it very clear that they were completely decoupled all the time and that just wasn't the right way to run the business. And so I mean do you think it's a fair interpretation of your comments to say that there's a real fundamental change in the way [indiscernible] and that the sort of cash include disposals and other nonoperating factors are now a prominent part of that process, and we should think about it that way? Or is this just a unique circumstance to the moment? Neil Chapman : No, I don't think it's a fair way of characterizing it. I mean in the short term, we have elected to do the following. We've elected to take no more debt on because we want to protect the strength of our balance sheet. We want to and we feel a great commitment to our dividend. And so what other knob do you turn when you're in that situation? It's capital expenditure. I see this as a short-term reduction in capital expenditure to manage the current situation. We retain a very competitive balance sheet. I mean you know that. You've seen this. It's very competitive versus our peers, and we want to protect that, and so we're doing that by taking shortcuts and expenses. It doesn't change our fundamental belief that you need a strong balance sheet and you need to invest in the most attractive prospects, the most competitive prospects that are out there. So again, Sam, I don't think it's a fundamental change. I think it's a response to the short-term environment. Sam Margolin : Okay. And I apologize for belaboring that. I just wanted to clarify. And then on a related note, within this process of high grading for the near term, the focus is to be on Permian, and it seems like the LNG projects may have [indiscernible] LNG sort of tied to some other goals for the company [indiscernible]. Neil Chapman : Yes. Yes, Sam, we kind of lost you there, but I'm going to say -- I'm going to try and interpret what I heard. It was around LNG and the LNG projects, and you're aware that we have 2 significant opportunities in Mozambique and in Papua New Guinea. I think we're continuing in Papua New Guinea to work with the government on the P'nyang fiscals, and that process is ongoing. We're continuing to work with our partners in Mozambique, both the government and our partners on the timing. I think consistent with what you see in our capital spending and consistent with what you see across the industry, there could be a time component in terms of a delay. You will recall that both those 2 projects, even in 2018, we were talking about them coming online in the '25 -- 2025 type of period. There is a chance that will slip a few years or a little bit of time beyond that. Yes. Sorry, Sam, we lost it. If that wasn't the question you were looking for, that's what I heard. Sam Margolin : No, I was going to ask if you could tie to in some of the ESG efforts as well. But if I have bad connection, I'll leave it there and ask Stephen later. Operator : Next, we'll go to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Philip Gresh : I guess I'm going to also -- I'm going to ask another follow-up, I suppose, on this topic. But as we look at the current cash balances for the company and your CapEx plans, is there a minimum level of cash that you're, I guess, basing your commentary on that you would not plan to be adding additional debt? And is there anything in there or inorganically and plan around asset sales? Or is that commentary completely organic in nature?  And I guess the bigger picture question is, you're talking a lot about efficiency improvements and lowering costs. So structurally, the $30 billion to $35 billion in CapEx you've talked about, is that something that through efficiency gains and things you believe actually would be lower in the future? Neil Chapman : Yes. Let me try and address them in order. Asset sales, I mean, but it's not the best environment for selling assets, but I can assure you that we are in the market with multiple assets, and we're progressing asset sales. Whether they will finalize or come to fruition, time will tell. But I think it all depends on what you're selling, what market, what location, what's the age of the asset, et cetera. And so we are extremely active in that space. But I never like to try and predict what will happen in the future of that because it depends on both the buyer and the seller. So -- but we're still progressing.  In terms of cost savings, as I mentioned earlier on and how that impacts CapEx, I'm optimistic that when times get really tough for everybody in that supply chain of project development and project execution, you identify and drive new efficiencies. So you would hope that they can be retained, and you would hope -- and we certainly plan that we'll benefit from those in the long term. Will it change our capital expenditure from $33 billion, which was our original plan for this year, down to $23 million just through savings? I think that's probably a little bit optimistic, frankly. But we do see savings coming out, and we do see savings coming for the long term.  In terms of the cash balance, what we did was we took on more long-term debt over the last 4 months at what we regard is attractive -- certainly relatively attractive prices, but that was to provide more flexibility during this period. And when you're in a volatile period, higher cash is what we wanted to do. And of course, it provides the optionality to reduce short-term debt. But that's all part of our debt management, cash management, capital allocation process. Stephen Littleton : I guess, Neil, I'd also add, currently, Phil, we have a pretty high cash level given the amount of uncertainty that's out in the market. But if you go back in time, we've historically carried a cash balance in the $5 billion or lower. And so right now, obviously, we're in an unprecedented time, we thought it was appropriate to -- we had the appropriate level of liquidity to manage us through the next couple of quarters just to make sure we see how the recovery is going to respond. But I look back on our history, usually, that cash balance is substantially lower. Neil Chapman : Yes. Philip Gresh : Okay. Follow-up question, I suppose it's somewhat related to what Doug Leggate was asking about with respect to sustaining capital. It's just more specific to the Permian. As we look at the exit rate that you're talking about for the rig count and implicitly for capital spending, I think your guidance for this year of 345,000 on production would obviously imply something a bit higher than that as an exit. But are you -- I guess with this $19 billion or less of spending, would that -- should that imply to us that you would let Permian production decline in 2021? Or do you feel that there are levers available to you that, that would not be embedded in that plan? Neil Chapman : Yes. I would tell you, let's talk about Permian this year first. Our outlook for this year is pretty close to what I said at Investor Day. I think it's -- again, you'll correct me here, but it's 345,000 Kbd, and so that's about just 15,000 below. And that really reflects, because of the way we are developing the Permian with these large-scale developments and large cube developments. The capital you invest last year has a material impact on the results this year. And so that's why it's only a 15,000 Kbd reduction.  In terms of the following year, we haven't finalized those plans yet. Of course, if there's no investment, these wells decline rapidly. But you're aware that we have a considerable number of DUCs sitting out there. You'll also be aware, it's a much higher cost of frac than it is to drill. And that's really, really important. So just looking at drilling rigs alone doesn't tell you the full story. I don't anticipate that our volumes will reduce next year. We'll finalize that through the plan process. We'll finalize that with our Board in November. And of course, we'll share that with you at the Investor Day in the first quarter next year. Stephen Littleton : And Neil, if you don't mind, I'll add, I think, Phil, it will also depend on what's the business environment look like, and that's the beauty of the Permian. We'll be able to flex up or down depending on what we see in terms of the market. Neil Chapman : Yes. Philip Gresh : Okay. So on the $19 billion, your base case would be -- it would not decline. Is that the conclusion? Neil Chapman : Certainly, at a $19 billion capital spending, it would not decline, no. Operator : Next, we will go to Jason Gammel with Jefferies. Jason Gammel : While we're on the topic of the Permian, I was hoping that you might be able to address, Neil, what you're seeing on the performance from wells that had been curtailed but are not being brought back online. Are you saying pretty flush production from those wells? Neil Chapman : Yes. Actually, it's something we looked at very closely when we shut in these wells. We wanted to be sure that when we bring them back online that they come back at what I always describe as the same position on the type curve, and that's indeed what we've seen. We were confident that if we shut in, we'd resume at or above where it left on that decline curve. And Jason, that's what we're seeing. Jason Gammel : Excellent. Maybe if I could just shift over to the Downstream. You talked about the margin environment still being pretty poor. How are you able to, given the flexibility of your system, shift around product yields? And I'm taking really integration to petrochemicals and being able to more maximize feed into that system and away from fuels. And then also, how are you dealing with jet fuel, just given the significant inventories and lead demand for that product? Neil Chapman : Yes. I think, Jason, you have to start with jet fuel, frankly, because of all transportation fuels, jet is obviously lagging the most. From our perspective, it's very clear that's because of the lower international flights. That's the biggest issue. When you produce jet, what are you going to do with it? You've got to push as much jet as you can into the distillate pool, into the diesel pool. And actually, the demand for diesel is quite strong, but the margins are still relatively low, and that's because the refiners are pushing jet in up to the limits of the product quality, pushing jet in there, which is giving, if you like, an oversupply into that jet pool. It is interesting on the diesel or distillate demand.  And just throw a little bit of data, we see U.S. truck vehicle miles back to the pre-COVID levels. That is a really significant point. And so once you see commercial transportation going back to those pre-COVID levels, that is important. But of course, we see passenger vehicles lagging and jet lagging a lot.  In terms of Chemicals, Chemicals is a really interesting story in terms of what's happening in the demand for chemicals. It's very different depending on the products that you're making. If you are making products that's going into the packaging or medical industry, so think things like polyethylene, the demand is very, very strong. And actually, polyethylene demand is up 2% year-to-date. But not all polyethylenes are the same. Some go into packaging and some go into durables and construction, so think of things like pipe, construction pipe in your houses. So it's very, very different. Overall, we see strong demand for products that are going into packaging, medical; weaker demand for products that go into auto and construction. And that's important because it depends what feedstock you put into your steam crackers to make the right products. Of course, over the last quarter, we saw a contraction of the feed advantage between whether you're cracking ethane, which of course is gas, or you're cracking naphtha. There was little differentiation in the second quarter between those feedstocks. And at that time, refiners were putting more and more liquids into their feedstocks.  Certainly, from a U.S. perspective, as this quarter has evolved in the last month or 1.5 months, what you've seen is the advantage for gas, i.e., ethane in the U.S. chemical plants, that advantage has started to open up again, which means more chemical producers are putting more gas in the feedstock of their chemical plants, which means they're backing out naphtha. That's really what's happening. Operator : We'll take that from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Great. Maybe just a couple of quick ones on the downstream. Could you provide some color around the time line for the Beaumont expansion and whether that will be impacted from the timing point of view in terms of what your eventual outlook is for Permian production over the coming years? Neil Chapman : Yes. I would tell you, Ryan, as I mentioned earlier on, we're still working with our partners and our EPC contractors in terms of which of these Downstream projects that we are postponing, how long that postponement will be. And we're just not in a position yet to communicate that externally, not because we haven't fund our plans, we're still working with our contractors on that. So in due course, we will give you some further details or more details on that. What I would tell you is there's likely to be a postponement on that, the magnitude of that postponement on that project, and we'll come back to you later on, whether it's months or longer than that. Stephen Littleton : Neil, if you don't mind, I'd probably add to the fact that if you think about what we're doing at Beaumont, it's really all connected back to what's going on in the Permian. So being able to sync those up is going to be pretty critical longer term. Neil Chapman : Yes, it is. It is. Sure. Ryan Todd : Okay. And then maybe one final one. I mean we've seen -- over the last couple of quarters, we've seen pretty significant impairments from a number of your peers regarding both -- driven by both kind of short-term and long-term pricing assumptions as well as some certain assumptions on carbon transition. I mean can you talk a little bit about where you are in the process of revisiting some of those long-term assumptions? If anything, and in particular, where the oil sands have been hit pretty hard a number of your peers, where the oil sands kind of falls in terms of your long-term views regarding this? Neil Chapman : Yes. Yes. No, I appreciate you asking that question. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan. I always start with impairment saying it's really quite difficult to compare between companies on write-offs and impairment. It depends on the quality of the resource. It depends on the carrying costs. It depends on your price margins assumptions. It depends on your development plans. And you also have to put this context on this. There are different accounting rules, as I think you're aware. In Europe, IFRS goes straight to a discounted cash flow. GAAP rules are an undiscounted cash flow. So those are two very significant points, and I would just offer that as background.  For us, in addition to our normal monitoring for impairments throughout the year, we follow a very rigorous process each year following those GAAP accounting rules. It is part of our annual plan process. During that process, we refresh our views for long-term demand and supply and industry conditions each year. We look at that supply outlook. We look at the cost of supply for oil and gas. That drives the supply/demand outlook. That informs our view on prices. And as I've said previously, and we have said previously, our prices are generally within the range of third-party assessments. We are going through that work now on pricing, and we have not finished that work. When we have finished that work, we will review it with our Board, of course.  But again, as we have seen previously, what we're seeing so far, it is in line with third-party assessments. As part of that process and as part of that plan process, we look at the development plans for all of our resource base, and that would, of course, include oil sands. And the key part here is when we plan to develop each resource. And when we've completed that work, if changes to our long-term views on prices or if changes to our development plans are sufficient, then we'll follow the normal test for impairment. And that's the process we follow. We're following that process this year, and that process will be finalized with a Board review in November. Does that answer your question? Ryan Todd : Yes. Neil Chapman : Okay. Stephen Littleton : Well, we want to thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us the opportunity to highlight second quarter results and the decisive actions we are taking to manage through these challenging times and position ourselves for the eventual recovery. We appreciate your interest, and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, and please be safe. Neil Chapman : Thanks, everyone. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day everyone and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Before getting started, I wanted to say that I hope all of you on the call, your families and colleagues are safe, in light of the challenges our world continues to face as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. Joining me today are, Senior Vice President of ExxonMobil, Andy Swiger, the Corporation's Principal Financial Officer; and Jack Williams, who oversees the Downstream and Chemical businesses. After I cover the quarterly financial and operating results, Andy and Jack will provide their perspective, including an update on the steps we're taking to navigate the current market environment. Following those remarks, I will be happy to address specifics on the quarterly reported results while Andy and Jack will take your questions on broader themes, including market dynamics and the recovery, the corporations response, our financial and strategic priorities, progress on our drive for efficiencies and updates on major projects. Our comments this morning will reference to slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I'll now highlight developments since the second quarter of this year on the next slide. In the Upstream liquids realizations increased by approximately 75% with demand and prices recovering from lows encountered in the second quarter. This more than offset lower gas realizations. As market conditions improve all economic curtailments were brought back online by the end of the quarter. However, government mandated curtailments continue through the quarter. Despite the considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, we have been able to achieve our best ever safety and best reliability performance in the Upstream in five years. We continue to progress industry awareness developments in Guyana with the FID of Payara. In addition, we announced two new discoveries on the Stabroek block, Yellowtail and Redtail, marking our 17th and 18th discoveries in Guyana. In the Downstream, we achieved the best reliability and safety performance in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, industry refining margins fell to record lows, reflecting continued excess industry capacity and high levels of product inventory. Bottom of the cycle conditions persist in the chemical business with margins falling from the second quarter, primarily impacted by higher feedstock cost. Demand remained resilient. We continued strength in the packaging and hygiene segments and recovery in the automotive and construction sectors. Across the corporation, we reduced CapEx by over $1 billion from the second quarter, making further progress towards our 30% reduction target. During the quarter, we signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings to annually purchase 2.5 million barrels of renewable diesel for five years starting in 2022. We also expanded a joint agreement with Global Thermostat to advance and scale direct air capture technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. Let's move to Slide 4 for an overview of our third quarter results. The table on the left, provides a view of third quarter results relative to the second quarter. Starting with the second quarter, the reported loss of $1.1 billion included favorable identified items of $1.9 billion, driven by the non-cash inventory adjustments we noted in the second quarter. Excluding these items, the second quarter was a loss of $3 billion. Third quarter results were a loss of $700 million, including a $100 million non-cash benefit from inventory valuation. Excluding identified items, there was a $800 million loss in the third quarter, a $2.2 billion improvement from the second quarter. Significant improvement in Upstream liquids price was partially offset by lower gas realizations, as well as lower refining margins. Higher volumes across all three of our businesses increased earnings by $700 million as demand continued to recover from the unprecedented levels seen in the second quarter. Finally, lower operating expenses improved earnings by an additional $200 million compared to the second quarter. It's worth noting that the benefit of OpEx savings delivered by our organization increased earnings by $1 billion versus the third quarter of 2019. On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of results for each business. Note that the earnings comments are excluding identified items. Upstream earnings increased by approximately $1.5 billion, driven by higher liquids prices, partially offset by lower gas realizations, mainly due to a lag crude index LNG contract pricing. Volume impacts, including the recovery of economic curtailments, increased earnings by $140 million. Lower expenses, including the benefits of captured structural efficiencies, improved earnings by another $110 million. Moving to Slide 6, is a comparison of third quarter 2020 results relative to the third quarter 2019. Upstream earnings decreased by approximately $2.5 billion compared to the third quarter of 2019, reflecting the current price environment. The unfavorable volume impact was driven by curtailments and divestments. Lower production and exploration expenses were offset by unfavorable one-time tax items. On Slide 7, Upstream volumes increased by 34,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to the second quarter. With the challenging market conditions, we curtail production in unconventional and heavy oil assets starting in April, by the end of September, those volumes were back online. Government mandated reductions were implemented in May and continued through the third quarter. Those curtailments average 140,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite the environment, we achieved growth of 50,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, primarily in the Permian. Scheduled maintenance, and a third-party diluent supply outage at Kearl, decreased volumes by 90,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Decline was partially offset by higher entitlements. Moving to Slide 8, compared to the third quarter of 2019, Upstream volumes decreased by approximately 230,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Volumes were lower due to curtailments mentioned on the prior slide, as well as the divestment of our Norway non-operated assets at the end of 2019. Despite the current business environment, we saw continued liquids growth from Permian, Abu Dhabi and Guyana. Moving to the Downstream on Slide 9, earnings increased by approximately $380 million, relative to the second quarter. Margins increased by $70 million, despite record low industry margins, which decreased earnings by $470 million; favorable trading, supply chain impacts, marketing margins more than offset these impacts. Demand recovery, primarily in road transportation fuels and in lubricants, increased earnings by $300 million. We spared about 25% of refining capacity in the third quarter. Reduced expenses, including savings from maintenance and turnaround efficiencies and fewer contractors, increased earnings by $60 million. Moving to the next slide, I will discuss downstream results relative to the third quarter 2019. Earnings decreased approximately $1.5 billion, primarily driven by the low industry margin environment I just discussed. This was partially offset by $400 million of favorable trading, optimization and marketing margins. Lower volumes associated with COVID-19 demand destruction decreased earnings by $80 million. We continue to see the benefit of expense reductions and efficiencies, which improved earnings by $360 million. On Slide 11, I will discuss Chemical results. Chemical earnings increased by almost $200 million for the second quarter. Lower margins, reduced earnings by $80 million reflecting higher feedstock costs. Strong reliability, coupled with improved demand, resulted in higher volumes, which increased earnings by $220 million. It is worth noting, in the third quarter, polyethylene sales were a record high. This also highlights our strong reliability in the quarter. We continue to capture market and supply chain efficiencies. Reduced expenses, including reduced contracted utilization and activity pacing, improved earnings by $40 million. Turning to Slide 12, chemical earnings increased by more than $300 million relative to the third quarter of 2019. Earnings improved due to higher margins from lower fee costs and higher sales volumes. We also benefited from our cost reduction efforts, which improved earnings by $170 million in the quarter. The next slide provides an update on the progress we made reducing our costs. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15%. Through the third quarter, we are on track to exceed the reduction target, delivering additional cost savings. Cash operating costs are approximately 20% lower versus the third quarter of 2019, and are down almost 15% relative to the first quarter of this year. The cost reductions reflect decreased activity, maintenance and turnaround efficiencies, reduced contractor rates and lower logistics and supply chain costs. The reorganization of our businesses, along with value chains, has been critical in identifying and delivering these improvements. Importantly, we have realized these savings while improving safety, reliability and the environmental performance of our operations. Now moving on to capital spend on Slide 14. Third quarter capital spending was down more than 20% versus the second quarter. Reductions continue to be driven by pacing of short cycle unconventional investment. In the third quarter, we also reduced Downstream product spin as we ramped down activity. Importantly, our corporate project organization in collaboration with our contractors have managed to more than offset the cost of deferral preserving the overall value of the projects. Jack will share some additional details later in the call on this. Let's turn to the next page, where you can see the impact of these activities on our cash profile. Third quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $4.4 billion from the second quarter, with higher crude prices, increased volumes, and the benefits of OpEx savings. We also saw a benefit from working capital with lower product inventory. Gross debt decreased by about $700 million to $68.8 billion. We ended the quarter with $8.8 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 16. I will cover a few key considerations for the fourth quarter. In the Upstream, production is expected to remain in line with the third quarter. The announced government mandated production curtailments are expected to average 220,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, an increase of approximately 80,000 oil them barrels from the third quarter. The impacts of increased curtailments are anticipated to be offset by seasonally higher European gas demand. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand to be roughly in line with the third quarter with higher scheduled maintenance. In Chemical, we anticipate margins to be impacted by increased supply from capacity additions and improved industry utilization, with a recovery from hurricanes and reliability events. Our scheduled maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter, Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated, they'll be about $900 million. Capital spending is expected to be higher than the third quarter with one time milestone project payments. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andy. Andrew Swiger : Thank you, Stephen. First and foremost, we hope all of you and your families are safe and healthy. As we've discussed on previous calls, the challenges presented by COVID-19 are unlike anything the industry has ever seen, as is the response of our employees and contractors. They have gone to great lengths to safely maintain operations, manufacture and deliver the products society needs for sanitation and hygiene, as well as provide the fuels that ensure these and other critical supplies get to the places they are needed. They have responded to unprecedented market conditions with all three of our businesses at, or significantly below, bottom of cycle conditions. We could not be more proud of the exceptional efforts and response of our workforce. We are navigating this near-term uncertainty by achieving record safety and reliability performance, delivering better than expected cash savings that are on pace to exceed our 2020 OpEx and CapEx targets, while maintaining operations integrity and pacing projects to preserve long-term value and position us for the eventual recovery. This slide shows the demand impact of the pandemic. The corresponding industry response and third party projections for the market recovery after the second quarter lows. Crude and product inventories rose to a peak in June as the reduction in demand outpaced supply cuts. In the third quarter, inventories have started to fall as demand recovers and exceeds current supply levels. Third-party estimates suggest liquids inventory decreased by about 200 million barrels in the third quarter and they expect demand to return to pre-COVID levels in 2021. Of course, the demand projections shown here, lead to a few critical questions. How will the supplier respond? What will be the resulting supply and demand balance? And what price is required to achieve this? In light of this, it is worth looking at the fundamentals. I'll start with the next slide with Upstream supply. In the Upstream, which is a depletion business, capital investment is required to add supply to offset ongoing decline. This chart shows an obvious, but sometimes overlooked relationship. Industry investment levels rise and fall at price or more specifically the industry's level of revenue. Low price environments lead to low investment levels, and therefore, less new supply to offset depletion. Eventually, available supply declines, leading to a tight supply and demand balance and higher prices. Over the past five years, we have seen a steady decline in conventional spending, which has been somewhat offset by North American unconventional growth. Pre-pandemic,, the industry was already investing at levels below historic rates and below what would be required to meet future demand and overcome natural depletion. All of this, based on recent estimates, from the International Energy Agency. The overall impact of the pandemic this year has been dramatic, significantly reducing current investment levels, which exacerbates the problem. On top of this, industry exploration continues at multi-decade lows. Meanwhile, underlying production decline of 5% to 6% per year continues relentlessly. Looking forward, if the industry is to meet credible third party estimates for energy demand, we will need to significantly increase investments. This is shown here with a range of third-party estimates for the required level of future investments. For the industry to fund at this level of investments, prices will have to rise. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jack. Jack Williams : Thanks Andy. Moving to Slide 22. I'm going to extend the point Andy just made on crude prices to refining and chemical margins. This chart puts the current refining and chemical margins into the context of the last 20 years. Refining is a high cyclical industry with significant ups and downs. But today's net refining margins are below any low experienced in the prior 20 years. Demand for diesel and gasoline has recovered much faster than jet, which is still 45% below pre-COVID levels. The large differences in the demand recovery for the different transportation fuels, put significant pressure on refinery operations, with excess jet production having to be blended into other products, which has driven second quarter and third quarter net refinery margins negative and to record low levels. Chemical margins are also close to the bottom of cycle conditions. Although chemical demand has remained strong, particularly in the packaging and medical markets, the excess supply for major investments on the Gulf Coast in Asia continues to pressure margins. Industry's responding by shutting down capacity and refining and pushing out new investments in Chemicals. This is a typical response we've seen historically, as producer struggled to maintain operations in very challenging financial conditions. We expect this will continue until supply and demand come into balance and margins recover. So, in summary, we see a recovery on the horizon across each of our businesses. We believe it is less a matter of if, but more a matter of when. This uncertainty led to actions we've taken this year, which underpins our plans for 2021. As was mentioned on this call last quarter, we acted quickly and decisively earlier this year to the challenging economic environment while retaining flexibility and positioning the business for the recovery that will inevitably come. Looking to 2021, we're focused on continuing this year's progress. Despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID, our operations are delivering world-class performance. Our safety, and the reliability of our operations, have been at or close to record levels in all three of our businesses. We're committed to maintain this performance in 2021. In terms of cash OpEx, in April, we gave the organization a target to reduce operating expenses for the year by 15%. We're well on our way to delivering even larger reductions and will achieve further structural efficiencies next year. We reduced this year's CapEx plan by 30% to $23 billion and similar to OpEx, expect to finish the year below our reduction target. To achieve this, we took steps to delay or postponed projects in construction. We challenged our organization and partners to offset any value impact from these delays with additional execution efficiencies, and our project teams delivered. In 2021, we expect to drive CapEx lower than this year to between $16 billion and $19 billion. Portfolio high grading activities are continuing. Our current conditions are challenging. We're making progress and anticipate additional assets in the market over the next 12 months. And finally, there will be no change to our capital allocation priorities of investing in industry advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable dividend. The progress we've made this year gives us confidence as we head into 2021. The work done over the last couple of years to improve our organization and drive efficiencies paid off in responding to the pandemic. Let me cover this in a little more detail. A critical change has been the move, from an organization focused on our functions to an organization aligned along the value chain of our businesses. This reduced the senior leadership structure and associated overhead, while improving line of sight across the business and increasing efforts to drive higher value from our assets. The new organization is also giving us the opportunity for deeper structural efficiencies, which we began working on in the second half of last year. As the pandemic hit, we were well positioned to accelerate the implementation of these efficiencies in response to the significant deterioration of economic conditions. The structural changes include a significant reduction in the size of our workforce driven by increasing spans of control, high grading activities, accelerating the use of digital technologies and leveraging the lower activity levels. These workforce reductions have been developed on a country-by-country, business-by-business basis. As you are likely aware, we've recently made announcements in Australia, Europe and then here in the US this week. Overall, we anticipate a reduction in our global workforce, which includes employees and contractors, of 15% by year-end 2022 versus 2019 staffing levels. The vast majority of these reductions are occurring in above field or above side organizations. Our operating organization are driving further cost reductions in areas such as maintenance and logistics and supply chain, while continuing their focus on delivering world-class safety, reliability and environmental performance. Our Global Projects organization, formed last year, continues to build on our industry-leading project execution competency. This organization is focused on prioritizing our project portfolio to maximize value while capturing efficiencies in the current market. A single corporate organization for project execution has been critical and leveraging the scale of the corporations investments and effectively working with the contractor community, our partners and host governments to efficiently reduce spend while preserving optionality and long-term value. Our projects organization is managing the industry's most attractive portfolio of projects. We continue to aggressively advance our highest value projects and maintain exploration activities in both Guyana and Brazil. We are also taking advantage of the more favorable cost environment to progress the Corpus Christi chemical project and deliver it ahead of schedule and under budget. We're efficiently pacing short cycle Permian developments and working with our partners to defer other Downstream Chemical and LNG projects. Importantly, we're not canceling any projects that are in execution or in the funding process. These remain attractive investments and while the value of these projects may be deferred, it will not be diminished. Let me now turn to our progress in Guyana. With the announcement of two discoveries on the Stabroek Block during the quarter, Yellowtail 2 and Redtail 1, recoverable resource estimate is now approaching 9 billion oil equivalent barrels, positioning it as the largest new conventional liquids play in the last decade. The Liza 2 project remains on schedule for 2022 start-up, the FPSO is under construction in Singapore, and the first offshore installation campaign is underway. Also in the quarter we sanctioned the Payara project, our third major deepwater development on the Stabroek Block. We anticipate first production in 2024 and we'll have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and a resource base of 600 million barrels of oil. The FPSO construction will follow Liza 2, utilizing many of the same contractors and fabrication yards. And we're building out the in-country community required to be successful over the long term. In total, there are now more than 2,000 Guyanese citizens supporting the project activities and more than 2,500 Guyanese companies registered with the projects center for local business development that is focused on building local business capacity. Turning to the Permian. Our focus in the Permian is on preserving value as we continue to pace our activity levels. We expect Permian production to total about 360,000 oil equivalent barrels per day this year, which is about a third, higher than last year and consistent with our plan despite a more than 35% reduction in CapEx spend and a 14,000 barrel per day, year-to-date reduction due to COVID related economic curtailments. Our team has done an exceptional job in driving down drilling and completion cost through improved performance and productivity. We're currently operating about 15 rigs as we head into next year and we expect further reductions stabilizing at around 10 to 12 rigs. We will obviously keep a close eye on the market and make necessary adjustments as the environment evolves. At this time, our expectation is that our development activity level will hold fairly steady in 2021. With current plans, next year's production is expected to average approximately 400,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. At this time, I'll hand the call back over to Andy to talk about our portfolio prioritization. Andrew Swiger : Thanks. As Jack just highlighted, we have an attractive set of investment opportunities that is continuing to grow. But the constraints brought on by the pandemic, we are actively managing this portfolio of investments, with a focus on advancing our highest value projects. As our opportunity set grows and conditions evolve, we continue to reassess our investment portfolio and prioritize our spend. Each project must remain advantage versus industry, and competitive with our other opportunities. We work to ensure our assets remain a good strategic fit, provide material growth potential, and ultimately create differentiating value. This is a continuous process and an essential element of our annual planning process. It is particularly important this year as we work to develop plans within the constraints brought on by the pandemic. With the challenging price environment and our current debt levels, added emphasis is being placed on evaluating our entire portfolio for the potential of additional asset divestments. While continuing to progress our previously announced divestment program of $15 billion, we may expand it through a reevaluation of our North American dry gas assets, which are currently included in the corporation's long-term development plan. More specifically, we are evaluating the opportunity to bring the value of some of these assets forward by removing them from the development plan and marketing them through our divestment program. In total, the assets under consideration, have carrying values of approximately $25 billion to $30 billion, which could be at risk for impairment, depending on the candidates for divestment and the current estimate of their market value. We expect to complete the review as part of our planned process, which will be finalized with the board in November, and will be shared with all of you as part of future earnings calls and at our analyst meeting early next year. Given the importance of the current market conditions on our plans and decisions, I'd like to return to the price and margin environment and the earnings potential of the corporation. Historically, our three businesses, each significant in the industry, are typically a different points in their business cycles, which helps mitigate the impacts of their downcycles. In this unprecedented environment, all three businesses are simultaneously experiencing prices and margins below the 10 year range, significantly impacting the corporations earnings. We see the impact in the broader industry, with mounting losses, reduced investments and increased closures. And while questions remain around future demand recovery, one thing is certain, current conditions cannot continue. Supply and demand will eventually meet, prices and margins will respond. This suggests there is much more margin and price upside than downside going forward, and therefore, an expected increase in earnings. For perspective, the earnings range over the prior 10 year period has been between $2 billion and $8 billion per year in the Downstream, and between $1 billion and $5 billion per year in Chemical, far cry from where we are today. And while we may not see a return to average earnings in the near term, we should at least move to the bottom end of the historic range, which we see as the minimum levels demonstrated by a decade of industry experience. This is the basis upon which we are building next year's plan. If we see a recovery, just to the bottom of the 10 year range, and our Brent crude price in the range of credible third party estimates, we will be able to maintain the dividend while holding gross debt flat with second quarter levels. This morning, we've given you an overview of how we are navigating the challenging near-term market environment and discussed how market forces will restore supply and demand balances and improve the price and margin environment. The longer-term fundamentals remain robust, economies will recover, people's lives will improve, and the demand for energy will grow. In the short term, you've seen adjustments in our capital allocation, but our long-term capital allocation priorities remain unchanged; investing at advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet and paying a reliable and growing dividend. We're developing a 2021 plan consistent with the uncertainties and in line with the simultaneous low margins and prices in each of our businesses. Our CapEx will be further reduced to the range of $16 billion to $19 billion. We're further reducing our cash operating expense with a focus on overhead. We are looking to increase divestments and working to maintain the dividend, while holding gross debt at second quarter levels. Of course, we all recognize the uncertainty in today's market. We are keeping a close eye on developments and importantly on maintaining the flexibility to respond as conditions evolve. With that, I'll turn it back to Jack. Jack Williams : Before we open up the lines for your questions, I want to reemphasize that we're pleased with the operational performance we've achieved. We're on track to better the spending targets we established earlier this year and we're positioning our portfolio for the future. And with that, I'll hand it back to Stephen to begin our Q&A session. Stephen Littleton : Thank you and your comments Jack and Andy. We'll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Littleton, Mr. Swiger and Mr. Williams. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : So, on the capital program, you guys, basically already gave us a hint as to sort of the categories that you're committed to at close to pre-COVID levels and the ones that you see the most opportunity to stay back. So, I guess I'll just focus my first question on the Permian. How much capital reduction in 2021 was already built-in because you've completed a lot of your facilities and infrastructure spends by that point? And then, how much do you think is the reduction in activity from what was planned before the crisis? Thank you. Andrew Swiger : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sam. I mentioned earlier, we're at 15 rigs now, going down to about 10, and we think 10 to 12 rigs will be where we're going to be in '21. Of course, with an eye towards what the market does. That's substantially down from our earlier plans, where we were planning to continue to, more or less, stay at a rig level in the kind of 50 rig, 50 to 60 rig level in the Permian. Growth is substantially down. But look, I just want to just reinforce that the decision to reduce the spin due to the cash flow constraints is not at all a reflection of our development results, it's quite to the contrary. We're very pleased with how things are going. I mentioned the efficiency improvement that we've seen. We're continuing to gain experience with the cube developments and confirming those are a lot of value in that approach. So, we're very confident in the quality of the resource, including the unique development plan we have in the Delaware Basin, and then also the logistics integration we had at the Gulf Coast. So, we really like what we're seeing out there. We're just going to curtail activity because we have the discretion to do so and defer and move some of that capital to other opportunities. Sam Margolin : And I think I have a follow-up, and I think it's for Andy, and it's about asset sales. A lot of your businesses are organized in JVs and equity affiliates and from the perspective of a Stock Analyst that usually doesn't mean anything. But right now, the dividend at Exxon's level is stressed, just given the environment. And that's a problem because it doesn't always align with the capital priorities of affiliates. So, instead of thinking about disposals by Sam Margolin : Asset category or segment, does it make sense to think about them from the perspective of asset class and maybe affiliate positions? And JVs are a logical place to look for disposals, because at the very least, you sort of align production with your cash - your uses of cash priorities? Jack Williams : Sam, thanks for the question. Our review for divestment candidates is quite comprehensive and it looks across every sort of different way you can cut the business. In terms of what we think is no longer a strategic fit, it's all the criteria for divestment, regardless of whether it's in a JV, an equity company, or a more conventional type of arrangements there. So, as we go through this and it's a process of continual renewal and review, we don't really find this sort of categories that you have suggested as being, as representing any sort of a barrier to analysis. There may be some friction depending on agreements in some of these arrangements and so forth, but by and large with how it's existed, we've worked with the operator or the other partners to reach a resolution and be able to put the right assets into the market at the right time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Swiger : Good morning, Devin. Operator : Devin, your line might be muted. Okay. We'll move on to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Andy, I want to come back to Slide 29 where you were talking about the dividend coverage potential in 2021. If I look at the oil price, you're implying for the third quarter, being at the low end of historic range around $40 oil, and then you assumed recovery in refining margins there. I think the 2021 would imply the $2 billion of the $2.8 billion recovery there to get back to the low end, if I understood that correctly. So, I guess, are you trying to imply that you think you can, if you get a little bit of recovery in refining, that you can cover your dividend in the low 40s organically? Andrew Swiger : I think, let me - and this is a really important point and I think the question that's on a lot of people's mind. So, I'd like to take a little bit of time to go back through and really cover the way we're thinking about this. From an overall messaging point, our objective is to maintain the dividend, advance the highest value investments, and maintain the debt at a cost competitive limit. With prices at the low end at the historical ranges, looking at those bars there at the low end of those historical ranges, the plans we're working on to accomplish this, that will accomplish this, why is that? Because of the actions we've taken; the OpEx reduction, the workforce reduction, capital reduction to a level optimized to preserve long-term value, yet at a level that preserves flexibility and access to debt markets. And prices and margins, as we've said, are at a historic lows across all three businesses. That's obviously not where we are today when you look at those diamonds. But if you look at the mounting losses across the industry, the reduced investments we're seeing, the rationalizations, the project cancellations, the deferrals, it's clear to us that we're going to see an improvement in the industry. Our base plan conservatively assumes a gradual economic recovery and modest prices, not unlike our past plans and consistent with third-party ranges, including the oil price, which you asked about. It's really hard to predict the pace and a path to recovery for each of the businesses, and they do offset to some extent as we've talked about here. As an example, our gas business is currently running ahead of our assumptions. Refining is also up, as you point out, from the third quarter lows. We have built some contingency into our plans and believe we have enough to accommodate the uncertainty. But as I said, we keep a close eye on weather developments. Phil Gresh : I guess, maybe to clarify before my second question, are you implying any amount of asset sale proceeds in your ability to maintain the dividend without increase in gross debt in 2021? Andrew Swiger : The plans have a modest amount of asset sales in there. As I said, we have a lot in the market. We are in active discussions. We have bids coming in. And again, as I also talked about, we're looking at the plans and finalizing the plans of potentially putting even more into the market. So, there is a modest level of asset sales in those plans. Jack Williams : That's not just - also the Downstream as well. Andrew Swiger : Across the businesses. Phil Gresh : Right. Okay. And do you have a broader view on 2021 production overall? Obviously, you said the Permian is going to grow, but at this level of capital spending, $16 billion to $19 billion, how does that correlate to what production could look like more broadly? Stephen Littleton : Yes. Phil, as you can imagine, it's pretty difficult to get a good grasp on what production is going to do in 2021 with all the curtailments and we're surely not going to get out in front and try to predict what OpEx is going to do, and we're producing in several of the country. So, there's a lot of - there's a wide band of uncertainty, but broadly speaking, we would see production staying around - about flat year-on-year. Operator : Next we'll go to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : My first question is just continuing on with the balance sheet and dividend line of questions and I don't mean to keep hitting on it, but I think it is important for the market and investors. So, we appreciate all the details on '21. There is still some uncertainty about Exxon not intending to take on the additional debt, but can you just clarify that if in the event that realized prices and margins are lower than your expectation, can you just clarify whether you would take on additional debt in order to fund high return projects along with the dividend? Or is your comment intended to signal that the company does not intend to take on any additional debt, period? Andrew Swiger : Jeanine, thanks for the question. As we've said in the past, we really want to ensure that we remain competitive access - cost competitive access to debt. Why is that? We do have refinancing needs going forward in the future as term debt matures. But we also want to maintain a level of balance sheet flexibility. We believe that going above the $70 billion level, that second quarter level, is going to impact those objectives. Again, when we think about what might happen in the future, lot of hypotheticals there. Our plans comprehend a bunch of uncertainty. We do need to get back to the bottom of cycle type conditions. This is not a cycle. The pandemic is out with cycle experience there in order to be able to continue to move forward in a way that we've talked about. But I would say that if things go along the way they are, if they were to persist this way, and we don't think they will, because the energies can't survive. And there's going to be a lot of measures being taken by a lot of people's to react to the situation. Jeanine Wai : My second question is, maybe just looking out to the medium and longer term and sustaining capital. Last quarter you identified Downstream and Chemical sustaining capital as about $2 billion to $4 billion collectively on the Upstream side, how does the second half '20 run rate's been compared to what would be considered necessary to maintain productive capacity over the longer term? We know that you're spending some money in the back half of this year on several longer term, medium term project growth like Guyana and Tengiz, for example, but will those projects that you're spending on now, will they contribute at a level that's necessary to offset declines elsewhere in the portfolio down the line? Thank you. Jack Williams : Thanks, Jeanine. Let me take that one. As we think about where we're spending our money this year, our CapEx this year and where we'll likely be spending in next year, you mentioned Tengiz and Guyana, the Corpus cracker is another one, Bacalhau in Brazil is another one. And then, we're continuing on with the Golden Pass development as well. And then, we already talked about the Permian. So, those are kind of the headline large major projects that are attracting capital today and likely will be next year. And then, there is a modest amount of, in all three businesses, that were spending at kind of a local level, the plant level, the local field level, that it's kind of in the low single digits of billions of dollars. So, that's kind of where we are standing right now. And as I mentioned, that's - we think production's largely going to be fairly flat next year. And then, that's without really much contribution from any of these projects I just talked about. So we - as we look forward, obviously, the rate at which we'll look at potentially growing our CapEx is going to be dependent on how the market evolves but we do see growing it over time. We see growing it at a more moderate pace. Retention that we talked about before, again, depending on where we see the market. But we feel that the level we've given for 2021, provides sufficient capital to progress the big developments that we want to, these really industry leading developments that are ongoing, and still maintaining a modest amount of activity, kind of in the base that as you said offsets decline. Operator : We'll go back to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So, I wanted to ask on the earnings potential across from your different business units. In the deck, you have a very helpful Slide 29. You talked about in your prepared remarks as well, the contextualize is what we're seeing right now relative to history. When you think about those different buckets, two areas we've started to see a recovery, back into the 10 year ranges would be Chemicals and natural gas. The first question I have is on the Chemical side. And we think about what differentiates Exxon's portfolio versus a lot of peers historically, you have this large, very profitable high return Chemicals business, and it was historically a big cash flow generator. And since we last had strong industry margins, there has been some expansions and improvements across that business. And it's kind of hard from our seat to really drive the difference between moves in some of the benchmark margins and underlying profitability and cash flow in the business. And my question is, given what's changed in that portfolio, to the extent that we see a recovery in Chemicals margins back into those historical ranges or something, in my opinion, that we saw in 2017 or 2018. Are there material differences in the business now that will drive cash flow and earnings higher or lower as we look out over the next few years? Jack Williams : Thanks, Deven. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about the Chemicals business a little bit. If you look at why we're doing this as well as we are this year in Chemicals, it's really this polyethylene weighting we have. It's holding up very well in this kind of COVID environment we're in, as well as some reductions in operating expenses. That's across all the businesses, including chemicals, and that's certainly providing a tailwind. We're also running very reliably this year. I referred to that earlier and that has benefited us because others have had difficulties. And so, we've really benefited from that good strong performance. And then, the other kind of unique part of our Chemicals business is this integration with the Downstream. And that has benefited both the Downstream and Chemicals this year as we've been able to really nimbly, kind of, optimize the feedstocks that we've been moving into our crackers. And sometimes cracking some distressed refining streams. Then moving between chemicals and gas a bit as those as those feedstock prices have moved around. So, having a really good year this year in the Chemicals business, and it's certainly helping us get to this environment. As you look forward, I mentioned the Corpus cracker that will be coming online at the end of 2021. That's certainly going to be helpful as we look going into the next cycle. And then, we have these other projects that are paused, but certainly not canceled; the polypropylene expansions and then especially Chemical expansions, Baytown. And then, further out, we're still looking at the opportunity to add a cracker in China. So, we are adding - we are looking at investments today - going forward on investments today and we'll be substantially adding the Chemicals earnings capacity and cash flow capacity going forward. But as we get into the that next, kind of, top of cycle conditions, I would expect us to be at or above, quite frankly above, where we've been back in the 2016-2017 time period. Devin McDermott : That makes a lot of sense and very helpful color. The second question I have, and it's on the other color we've seen, a sharper recovery here is on the natural gas side, and some comments on the call about the potential divestiture of the North America or US had dry gas assets, that the bigger recovery here, I think that we've seen is in global LNG, moving pretty sharply off of balloons in terms of what the prices have turned it over the past few months. Some of the deferrals and capital also push out some of the LNG projects, I think that you had previously in the plan. I was just wondering if you could address the role of natural gas in LNG specifically to have in your portfolio going forward. And your views, if you think you have some on the sustainability of some of this stronger pricing that we're seeing right now globally for natural gas? Andrew Swiger : Hi, Devin. Thanks for the question. It's obviously, the phenomenon, if I look just first at North America, I know your question's on LNG, is driven by people looking at supply and demand balance as related to the relative under investment that's been going on there for a while. That's important. Because it's also in the long term when you think about LNG. That will come into play down the road as well. North America is an important source of LNG supply these days. But the concept of under investment leading to supply and demand issues in the long term is also fundamental with the LNG business as well. We have seen a good business continuing to go forward in LNG. A lot of the businesses are still unrelated to our linkages with crude price, index prices to crude and so forth, so it's rebounded. It is rebounding with the crude price run up in the third quarter there. That's a good thing. I think as the world resumes economic growth, you're going to continue to see the LNG business grow very strongly, probably above GDP as it was before. There is no reason not to believe that's going to happen, as it works its way into more power generation around the world, industrial applications, so forth. And to the extent that there is a hiatus in LNG investment. We are deferring some of our projects with a short term time, probably underpins a continuing strong fundamental future for that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Two related questions. The first one specifically, and you referenced a couple of times is your ability to, you just down halt projects but maintain value, sort of, classically that's never been the case, where you can you start to demobilize people and contractors, within time remobilize them again, that's a classic way of getting cost overrun. So, I just wondered, specifically whether you could just go through how you are addressing that? I think it will be intrinsically interesting. And secondly, just sort of topic related to that. I think Darren said in the first quarter that it was the three legs stood for with the balance sheet, the CapEx and the dividend. And you made the point, I think rightly, that CapEx pays for future dividend. So, at what point, are we going to see flex in the balance sheet? We discussed that we can make our own assessment about the dividend, but we can't so much, in terms of, along the wavelength of value creation that supports the longer term planning of the business. So, how much more flex have you got to keep pushing out what - you've made the point in multiple meetings during the March after market a very good project, how much flex have you got to keep pushing those projects out? Thanks. Jack Williams : Okay. John. That's a bit of a mouthful there. So, let me take the first piece on the projects and then I'll let Andy address that second question you had. On the projects and the ability to defer and take pause in some of these projects and not reduce the value - let me just talk about the Global Projects organization and the value that organization brings. As I mentioned earlier, kind of a single face to the contractor community, I think this organization is increasingly unique in industry. A lot of project management expertise and experience in this organization. And we are going to be, as we are continuing to look at the workforce, making sure we're keeping that competency, because we think it's very important for our fundamental competitive advantages we have going forward. So, we really leaned on that organization hard as to how we can manage through this period, pause some of these projects, and as I mentioned earlier, retaining the value. And so, a lot of this is, number one, leveraging a different environment. We have a much different supply demand environment on the Gulf Coast today than we had last year, much different, down something like 20%. That creates a different competitive dynamic and those labor costs are coming down. And we are able to leverage that, not only for the paused projects, but for projects we're continuing to execute with negotiating with those rates, what appropriate rates would be. So, we had a bit of a, kind of a stress situation in the Gulf Coast that has eased considerably, and that has helped us with cost. The other thing we're doing is we're pausing these projects as we're looking at the scopes of projects, and making sure, it gives us extra time to go through and scrub those and make sure they are absolutely fit for purpose and that we can - they're absolutely minimum kits. So, like, for instance, I mentioned before that we had taken a pause on the projects in Fawley in the UK. And there is on where we looked at the scope and we decided we could remove one tank from the scope, and that reduced cost. So, things like that that we're looking at the scopes. And then, the other thing is, in these paused times, we're able to completely finish engineering. And so, go out into the field, restart and have complete engineering done, and really have efficient execution once we get back to construction. So, the organization worked at it very hard, took a lot of time, and made sure for every single project, what scope to do and want to finish, when is the right time to restart, what work are we going to do to leave the project in a good shape, what are we going to do in the meantime before we restart, and line all that out. And when you add all that up, we're able to preserve all the value. And with that, I am going to hand over to Andy for the second part of the question. Andrew Swiger : Sure. Hi, the three-legged story you referred to that Darren talked about, I mean that is our capital allocation priorities; investing in advantage projects, to maintaining a strong balance sheet, and then paying the reliable and growing dividend. The CapEx piece of it is fundamentally important because as you quite rightly reflect, the CapEx we spend now is what those investments in America, what pay are the future dividends. We worked very hard on the 2020 and the 2021 CapEx levels, to get them to the point where we're maintaining progress on just the highest priority investments we're pausing, and deferring the remainder. And as Jack just pointed out, were doing that very carefully to ensure that we're preserving the bag and all that. For the programs that we've talked about in 2020 and 2021, that 2020 were in the range of $16 billion to $19 billion, that is about, in our judgment, that's the level that we think is the right one there. Obviously, as I said, we've maintained a little bit of contingency. There's a little bit of flex and all that. But that's really the level that we have judged to be the right one to balance getting through this crisis we're in. Now the pandemic, this way below the bottom of the cycle type thing. Preserve those opportunities and then be able to start moving the CapEx up in the outer years as the conditions in the world improve. As we have said they certainly must, given where industry is right now. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : I guess the first question, there's been a lot certainly that you guys have talked about and that's been written about, carbon, and a lot of your peers who have come out with explicit carbon targets, I just wanted to know where Exxon is in that journey in terms of coming out with carbon targets and how are you thinking about setting them to the extent that's the path you choose to go down? Jack Williams : Yes. Thanks, Niel. Let me just take a step back a little bit on how we see things and what we're doing. Basically, we see a world that's going to need more energy going forward; through population, through GDP growth, and a lot of that goes through the non-OECD countries. Energy consumption is tied to the population and GDP. And we don't think the current solutions set is really complete. We think we need more solutions there. And as you think about the size and the complexity of the infrastructure we have today, it's going to take some time to change that. So, to get to your specific question, near-term, what are we focusing on? We're focusing on mitigating our emissions operations and with that we have a commitment to reduce our carbon intensity over time. And that's what we're working on. And so, we kind of release that through our carbon and energy summary every year, how we're doing in that regard in terms of absolute carbon emissions and also the intensity, and that's kind of where we're focused. If you think about all the assets that we had - that we're producing back in, I think 2005, if you look at those today, we've had a significant reduction of those assets. Now, we've brought some new assets on but those reductions in the base through things like Cogen and energy efficiency, have been able to offset the emissions of the new assets we brought on. And then, longer term, we really think we need to be focusing on these high emissions sectors, PowerGen, commercial transportation, and industrial where the technologies are just insufficient to drive deep emission reductions and that's where we're looking for breakthrough technologies. I don't know, Andy, if you want to talk a little bit about the work we're doing there. And that's where we think we can uniquely contribute to society in terms of mitigating the risk of climate change. Andrew Swiger : Yes, Jack. You're absolutely right. The world does not have the complete solutions to get to where we need to meet that dual challenge of meeting the needs associated with economic growth while reducing emissions. Our focus is on, as Jack said, what we can do on our own operations, the targets set there, very much on the technology to fill those solution sets. And we talked a little bit about our nature and call. We talked about the Global Thermostat, the arrangement that we have a Director [indiscernible] front Stephen mentioned that. And you've seen other ones from time to time there. But we have a large research program ongoing in these sectors. We talked about algae in the past. We've talked about carbon capture and sequestration in general many times. These are the things that the world is going to need and these are the things that we have a unique capability in many cases. To take a lot of the ideas that are out there in society that people come to us and others with, and lack the specific capabilities or capacities to make the advancements in things like material sciences to improve something, to improve a particular catalyst that might be unnecessary. And they certainly lag the broad experience of process engineering that we have that is necessary to bring some of these technologies to scale. There are many things in flight there, but a lot of it is R&D. And I think in a world that is impatient for solutions. It's very hard to be patient to allow the R&D to happen, but we are, and we have that kind of posture towards it. And we certainly hope to be able to talk more and more about that in the coming years. Stephen Littleton : Andy, if you don't mind, I'd probably have to give a little bit of perspective of the progress we've made since our targets that we set back in 2018. When we said we were going to reduce our methane emissions by about 15% and flaring by 25%. And Neil, I can tell you we're clearly on target to not only achieve that but exceed those targets. So, it is a focus area and it's something that we take very seriously. Neil Mehta : And then, Stephen, around carbon specifically, has that - for many investors is a prerequisite, in a world where ESG is an important part of investing? Stephen Littleton : Agree. Neil Mehta : And then the follow-up question here is around refining. This question is for you, Jack. As you look at the next couple of years, recognizing demand is very uncertain, how do you see the refining landscape playing out? Do you see the market as being structurally oversupplied with tight crude differentials or do you actually see a path where capacity retirements can help to normalized margin over time? Jack Williams : I think both of those. I agree with both of those statements. The industry is currently oversupplied and rationalizations will - we'll work that over time. Since the start of the pandemic, we've already had a million barrels a day of announced refining closures. So, again, as I mentioned earlier the refining industry is under stress. And as you look to some low to medium conversion refineries, especially those that are not in good geographical locations where you have a growing demand, they're all under water. And so, we've already had some closures. I expect there will likely be more. And the deeper, the longer we stay in this sort of environment, the more announcements will come out. So, yes, I do think we're oversupplied right now and the market will take care of that through these closures. Operator : We'll next go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Andy and Jack, thanks for both of you guys getting on the call and letting it run a little long. I appreciate you getting me on. Andy, I'm going to sound a little bit on the dividend. I'd like to pre-phase my question like this, if the market is not prepared to pay for the recovery that you're laying out, which it clearly isn't, given where your stock is trading. Every time you pay a dividend that you can't afford, you're transferring value from equity to debt or basically your share price is going down. And that's basically what's happening right now. So, if the market is not paying you for that dividend despite the 60 plus years that you've paid this dividend, why would you continue to do that? And I'm curious what the view of the Board and the credit agencies are on this issue. And I guess the bottom line is what conditions would it take for you to say, you know what, we're not getting paid for this dividend, let's just cut and run and use the cash to preserve equity value? Andrew Swiger : Doug, this is something that we have thought long and hard about. We've discussed with our Board every quarter when we make the dividend discussion. But I'll tell you, we fully understand the importance of the dividend to our shareholders. It's very important to them and we're very thoughtful on that. What we've done is said to ourselves, let's look and see, and balancing in capital allocation and balancing with how we see with the likelihood the world evolving. What the right plan is to be able to meet our shareholders needs, interest in the dividend, at the same time moving the business forward there. So, we've constructed a plan that based on the things what we see happening in the market. The calibrations of what the business is doing, balance all of those sort of things and retain a little bit of flexibility as it goes forward. Now, as we talked about before, we do see ourselves moving back to bottom of the cycle conditions because the industry simply cannot continue on at these levels here, and in that plan, we will be able to maintain the dividend. We get into some situation where we're back in a world like we've been in the second and third quarters, obviously, all bets are off. And I think that's true across the industry. But we also don't think that's sustainable. So, that's really the rationale behind it and that's the way we've talked about it with the board and that's where we talk about it with outside agencies, that's where we talk about with our general investor class when we have those discussions. Doug Leggate : Sorry, Andy, to push you on this. What conditions would you see then, how long with this have to go on for you to say we can't do this any longer? Andrew Swiger : Doug, as I said we put the plan together for 2021 based on our best assessment of the market. It has some contingency on it, some flexibility on it, but were we to run out of that contingency, obviously we'd have to look to pull the next lever. Doug Leggate : Thank you for that. Can I do my quick follow-up? It's really just about visibility on the disposal front. You talked about $15 billion. You haven't done a whole heck of a lot yet. So, I'm just curious if you can give us any visibility or line of sight as to what you think is a realistic maturation of that disposal plan over the next 12 months? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. Jack Williams : Yes. Thanks, Doug. I'll take a shot at that one. We have quite a bit out in the market right now. We talked about, I think 11 out in the market. We're in fairly advanced discussions on a few of these assets. So, we do think that they're going to have some impact in '21 and '22. As you mentioned, it's a pretty difficult market on asset divestment. We're going to make sure we get value. We have something above our attention value. We are going to be patient. As Andy said, there is very little reliance on that in terms of where we see things in 2021, but we're going to continue to have productive discussions with prospective buyers. And we are seeing good interest. There is no question, we're seeing good interest. These will make some buyers within their portfolio is pretty nicely. So, we're going to continue on, Doug, in that regard. And again, just stick to the fact that we're going to make sure we get value. The assets, we'll keep them in our portfolio. Doug Leggate : Thanks very much. Andrew Swiger : Operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator : We'll take that last question from the line of Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Thanks for squeezing me in and taking time on the call. I'll just leave it at, or actually my first was on just - the cost reductions really haven't been touched upon that much. And you kind of said you're on path to exceed 15% cost reductions, maybe achieve something close to 20%, but it's still unclear what the structural amount of those reductions are versus what's related to lower activity. So, can you just kind of talk a little bit about the dividend buckets, those cost reductions fall into? And I have a follow-up. Jack Williams : Okay, Jason. Yes, I think, clearly, if you look back in March and April, we're talking about these reduction targets, really, a good bit of that was activity reduction. As we were sparing capacity and refineries and we were curtailing production activity in some of Upstream areas as we were having less chemical demand for the first month or two. And the idea was okay, we're going to certainly make sure we capture all the OpEx reductions in those areas. But also recognizing - and quite frankly, coming into the year, we were already working on the structural efficiencies. Some of that culminated in the workforce announcement that we made earlier and that I reiterated in the prepared presentation. But those efficiencies have been brought about by the reorganization of the businesses along these value chains versus the functions. And it just freed up a lot of capacity in terms of our ability to really get line of sight to the assets and to really up, be able to operate more efficiently, take away some friction, take away from what we call doing business with ourselves, and that kind of thing. As I mentioned before, often in presentations, leveraging digital technologies to where we can, we're more flexible in where we do work and making sure we're doing that in the most cost effective way. So, clearly, initially, there was a lot of reduction based on activity and those are being replaced with structural efficiencies as we move forward and those will play out, not just in 2021 but in 2022 going forward. Jason Gabelman : Is there a magnitude or a number you could put on those structural efficiencies? Andrew Swiger : I'm not really in position to give you a number on that. Jason Gabelman : And then, my second question is just kind of tying two things that have been mentioned on today's call, that global decarbonization effort and then global refining overcapacity. It seems like the push to decarbonize is focused in advanced economies in areas where you are heavily concentrated [indiscernible] of your refining footprint. So, do those two things kind of - the fact that OECD economies are pushing to decarbonize most of the energy growth that's happening in non-OECD, and your footprint for refining is predominantly in OECD countries. Do those teams frame how you think about your refining footprint going forward? The subtext being there could be more pressure in your legacy refining geographies than some other places we're seeing underlying demand growth? Thanks. Jack Williams : Yes, Jason. That's a good question. It's certainly plays a role. But as we look at our refining circuit and think about that going forward, we are fortunate that we had some highly complex refineries that very importantly are integrated with chemicals. That Chemicals integration is probably the overlying factor that we look at in terms of asset refiners that we think long-term are going to be very competitive. But we are looking, I think I've showed you before, this net cash margin for all refineries around the world, and the fact that we need to be on the left hand side of that with all our refineries. So, we've invested. We've made some investments in some of those; Antwerp, Rotterdam, Beaumont being some examples, Singapore, that we're going to make substantial moves to look to the left. And those are the refineries we think long term are going to be competitive in long term, but belong in the portfolio. So, we're making that call between ones we're going to invest. The ones that are already there are highly integrated refineries in the Gulf Coast, Baytown, Baton Rouge, and increasingly, Beaumont. And then, those that we're pushing in that direction with some good strategic investments to kind of shore up some of the conversion capacity gaps we've had. But clearly, as you look at kind of a medium, low complexity refineries, in an OECD country, that's not integrated with Chemicals, yeah, those are going to be a challenge going forward and that certainly plays into our thinking. Stephen Littleton : All right, thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you thought on us, the opportunity to highlight third quarter results. We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, and please be safe. Operator : And this concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in Exxon Mobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Before getting started, I hope all of you on the call, your families and your colleagues are safe in light of the continuing challenges we face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m pleased to welcome Darren Woods, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Exxon Mobil, who will be joining me for the call today. After I cover the quarterly financial and operational results, Dan will provide his perspectives on 2020 and updates on our priorities and plans for 2021 and beyond. Following those remarks, Darren and I\u2019ll be happy to address questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I\u2019ll now highlight developments since the third quarter of this year on the next slide. In the Upstream, gas realizations increased by approximately 40%, with demand and prices recovering from lows earlier in 2020, reflecting the impact of supply disruptions, colder weather and crude-linked LNG pricing. Liquids realizations were essentially flat with the third quarter with low October prices improving as the quarter progressed. While there were no economic curtailments in the quarter, government-mandated curtailments increased to approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Despite considerable challenges associated with the pandemic, the Upstream business matched its best ever reliability performance for the year. We continue to progress active exploration programs in Guyana and Brazil. And in the fourth quarter, announced a hydrocarbon discovery in Suriname, which extends Exxon Mobil\u2019s resource position in South America. In the Downstream, we achieved the best-ever personnel and process safety, as well as record reliability performance for the year. Industry refining margins remained at historic lows, driving industry rationalization with four times the 10 year average level of capacity reductions announced in 2020. With continuing weak margins, we expect further industry closures. The Chemical business matched the strong operational performance of the Upstream and Downstream, also achieving best-ever annual safety and reliability performance. This excellent performance enabled us to fully capture the improving margins, driven by sustained strength in packaging and continued recovery in automotive and global product markets. Across the corporation, we exceeded the operating cost and CapEx reduction targets that we laid out in April. We decisively responded to the unprecedented market conditions in 2020. Leveraging our global projects organization, we were able to defer spend and optimize projects to preserve the long-term value of our industry-leading investment portfolio. Let\u2019s move to Slide 4 for an overview of fourth quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of fourth quarter results relative to the third quarter. Starting with third quarter 2020, the reported loss of $700 million included favorable identified items of a $100 million, driven by the non-cash inventory adjustments we noted in the third quarter. Excluding these items, the third quarter loss was $800 million. Fourth quarter results were a loss of $20.1 billion, including $20.2 billion of identified items related to impairments. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $100 million, a $900 million improvement from the third quarter. Fourth quarter results were $200 million lower than the third quarter due to mark-to-market impacts on unsettled derivatives. This reflects the impact of marking-to-market open financial derivatives for which the physical trading strategy has not closed at the end of the quarter. We expect to realize the full earnings of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Improvements in upstream, natural gas and LNG prices as well as increased liquids production in Guyana also benefited earnings. Continued strong demand for high-value chemical performance products, coupled with the strong reliability, supported chemical earnings improvement of $200 million. Finally, as a result of the growing trend of our portfolio, we removed less strategic assets from our development plans, including certain dry gas resources, notably in North America. This resulted in a non-cash after-tax impairment charge of about $19 billion. On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items. Moving to Slide 5. Improved prices and margins in the Upstream and Chemical increased earnings by $530 million. The benefit of higher Upstream liquids production in Guyana, Canada, and the U.S. also improved earnings. This was offset by higher expenses due to the timing of planned turnaround, maintenance and the exploration activity. In the Downstream and Chemical, our integrated manufacturing sites allowed us to rapidly respond to dynamic market conditions and capture significant feedstock benefits. For example, we optimized units that typically produce gasoline to increase production of high-value chemical feedstocks, critical to the manufacturing of gowns, masks and hand sanitizer. Manufacturing results in the Downstream were improved with stronger liability and investments that high-grade product yields contributing $160 million to the fourth quarter earnings. On the next slides I will cover a brief summary of the full-year results. Slide 6 is a comparison of full-year 2020 results relative to 2019. Results reflected the unprecedented loss in demand driven by the economic impact of COVID, which in turn significantly depressed Upstream and Downstream margins. In responding to pandemic-related challenges, the organization rapidly reduced costs, achieving $3 billion in structural savings out of a total reduction of $8 billion. Our manufacturing facilities contributed an additional $1 billion with better reliability and improved product yields. Moving to Upstream volumes on Slide 7. Upstream volumes decreased by an average of approximately 190,000 oil equivalent barrels per day compared to 2019. Volumes were impacted by economic and government-mandated curtailments, as well as groningen production limits, which in total reduced volumes by approximately 210,000 oil equivalent barrels per day.  Excluding the impact of economic and government-mandated curtailments, entitlements, groningen production limits and divestments, volumes increased by about 110,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. This was in line with our original production plans with optimization of maintenance activity reducing the impact of economic curtailments. Moving to Slide 8. In April, we set a target to reduce 2020 cash operating expenses by 15% and CapEx by 30%. We exceeded these reduction targets. Looking at capital spending, we established reductions of 30%, the reorganization of our Upstream and Downstream businesses a couple of years ago enabled us accelerate the efficiency capture that we expected from these changes. Cash operating expenses were down $8 billion versus 2019, including structural reductions of about $3 billion that were delivered through optimization of supply chains and logistics, work process simplification and workforce reductions. We leveraged our new global product organization and strong relationships with EPCs to adjust our capital plan, deferring spend and further optimizing projects. This allowed us to reduce quarterly spend by $2 billion in the second quarter versus the first quarter, a 25% reduction. As we continued this work through the year, we reduced capital expenditures by $10 billion or greater than 30% versus 2019 in the original plan. Importantly, we view this while improving safety, reliability, and the environmental performance of our operation. Let\u2019s turn to the next page, where you can see the impact of these reductions on our cash profile. Excluding the impact of working capital affects, fourth quarter cash flow from operating activities was up $600 million from the third quarter. Gross debt decreased by about $1.2 billion to $67.6 billion. We ended the quarter with $4.4 billion of cash, a little above our minimum operating levels. Turning to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover a few key considerations for the first quarter. In the Upstream, government mandate curtailments are expected to average 150,000 oil equivalent barrels in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels from the fourth quarter. Production is expected to be higher in the first quarter due to seasonal gas demand. In the Downstream, we anticipate higher scheduled maintenance in terminals to be offset by additional efficiencies. In Chemical, we anticipate continued demand resilience across packaging, hygiene, and medical segments with continuing recovery in automotive and construction markets. Schedule maintenance is expected to be in line with third quarter. Corporate and finance expenses are anticipated to be about $700 million. Lastly, at current crude prices in Downstream and Chemical margins, we expect cash flow from operating activities to cover the dividend and our planned CapEx, which has flexibility to adjust depending on the business environment. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Stephen. Good morning. It\u2019s good to be on the call. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m like many of you happy to close the book on 2020 and optimistic for the year ahead. As you know, the pandemic has had devastating impacts on people and businesses around the world. These effects were especially severe in our industry. And as you consumption collapsed as economies shut down, oil prices hit their lowest point in history and refining margins fell well below their 10 year lows. It was the first time in memory that we saw simultaneous lows in each of our businesses. As I discussed a year ago, our response throughout these challenging times was primarily focused on three areas, protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities, keeping our operations running to support COVID response efforts, providing critical energy and products and aggressively reducing spend while preserving value to ensure we remained in the best possible position for the eventual recovery. We\u2019re pleased with how we performed on each of these. Our employees stepped up and made contributions to those in need of our products from hand sanitizer, especially products for protective equipment to fuel for first responders. Through extraordinary efforts, we kept operations running 24x7 while achieving strong safety results and exceptional reliability performance. At the same time we leveraged on the ongoing work in reorganizing our Upstream and Downstream businesses to significantly reduce costs and preserve value in an extremely challenging and uncertain market environment. We delivered on our cost reduction objectives and outperformed our revised plan, which we shared with even April. Going forward, we\u2019re continuing to work to reduce costs by leveraging synergies from aligned organizations and work processes across the Upstream, Downstream and Chemical. Further opportunities are being identified to reduce costs to drive cash flow and maintain our capital allocation priorities, including paying a strong dividend and maintaining a fortified balance sheet that we deleverage over time. I\u2019ll provide more detail momentarily on the successful efforts to drive greater efficiency across our businesses and further improve our cost structure. I\u2019ll also spend time discussing the significant steps we\u2019ve taking to reduce emissions intensity and absolute emissions and our work to advance lower emission technologies like our newly announced Low Carbon Solutions business. Collectively, this will help position us as an industry leader in greenhouse gas performance while helping society move to a lower carbon future. Let me start though by highlighting a few notable achievements from 2020 and what was a very difficult business environment. During a year of unprecedented challenges, our people successfully managed our global operations, ensuring the uninterrupted supply of essential energy and products, while achieving best ever safety and reliability performance. We reduced cash operating expenses by more than 15%, including $3 billion of structural improvements and reduced capital investments by more than 30% to $21 billion, without compromising the advantages or value of our projects. We achieved our 2020 emission reduction goals for both methane and flaring and established new plans for 2025 that are projected to be consistent with the goals of the Paris agreement. These plans are expected to reduce absolute Upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. Permian basin volumes exceeded our plan at 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, despite curtailments and reduced investment. This performance was driven by significant ongoing improvements in operating efficiencies and technology development. We progressed Liza Phase 2 and Payara developments in Guyana and continued our exploration success with three new discoveries, increasing the recoverable resource estimate on the Stabroek Block to nearly 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. Our Chemical business set a new record for polyethylene sales, reflecting the growth and demand for performance packaging, and strong operating performance of our expanding asset fleet. We maintained our position as a global leader in carbon capture, one we\u2019ve held for more than 30 years by increasing sequester CO2 to more than 120 million tonnes. This is well over twice the next closest competitor and larger than the next five competitors combined. To put this in perspective, 122 million tonnes is equivalent to taking more than 25 million passenger vehicles off the road in a year. In 2020, we focused on managing through the impacts of an unprecedented industry environment, leveraging the strengths of our corporation to progress an industry leading portfolio of advantaged investment opportunities, critical to the long term success of the company. At the same time, we drove deep structural efficiencies to improve competitiveness and position ourselves amongst the industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply. Let me start with our efficiencies. You may recall that in 2019, we completed our corporate reorganizations, moving from functional companies to businesses organized along the value chains. This allowed us to reduce overhead and provided end-to-end oversight for each business, which was a critical first step in streamlining the businesses to structurally reduce cost. It also allowed us to more effectively prioritize work and focus on the highest value activities.  Consistent organizations across each sector are allowing us to consolidate like activities to fully leverage the corporation scale, further reducing costs and improving effectiveness. Our global projects organization was established in 2019 as a result of this approach. This organization has played a critical role in reoptimizing our global investment portfolio, improving the capital efficiency of each object and when necessary cost-effectively deferring work. As we came into 2020 and the pandemic, the organization changes provided the foundation for significantly reducing spend across the businesses. Expense results are shown in this chart, which is consistent with the charts Stephen showed, excluding production in taxes and energy expenses that are a function of commodity price. As you can see, 60% of the $5 billion reduction from 2019 to 2020 was structural, driven by reduced overheads and operational efficiencies. The remaining reductions were temporary, driven by lower production and activity deferrals. During last year\u2019s planning process, each organization identified opportunities to convert the short term or temporary expense reductions into permanent structural efficiencies. This year, we expect to achieve a further $1 billion of structural efficiencies. By 2023, we will achieve a total of $6 billion in structural expense reductions versus 2019. I expect even further reductions as we take advantage of additional synergies unlocked by consistently organized businesses. One final point to make on this Slide. The structural reductions we\u2019ve shown are independent to the price environment we find ourselves. And on the other hand, returning activity and increased expenses between 2020 and 2023 are in large part, a function of the price environment. In lower price environments much of that increase would be further deferred. Let me now turn to another critical area, our capital investments. Over the past several years, we have been progressing a strategy to high-grade our asset base and improve the earnings and cash generation potential of our businesses. We announced work to invest less strategic assets and have been progressing a portfolio of industry leading investments. With pandemic driven losses, we responded quickly to bring capital spending in line with market conditions and an uncertain outlook and preserve our strong dividend. As we entered 2021, our capital plan is at a historic low, significantly reduced from 2020 levels. Our capital plans through 2025 reflected three key themes, value, flexibility, and discipline. Value derived from advancing our highest return, cash flow creative projects to deliver increased earnings and cash both near and long-term. Flexibility to respond to a dynamic market. We demonstrated this in 2020 and have developed our plans with this in mind. And discipline to make adjustments to our capital program depending on market conditions, to support a strong dividend and begin to deliver. Our plans are built on a price basis consistent with third-party outlooks and advance our highest return investments. They maintain a healthy balance sheet and our strong dividend. They\u2019re robust to a wide range of price scenarios, and using last year\u2019s experience and flexibility to respond to lower price environments.  In each plan year, we have a level of short cycle unconventional spend, which can be reduced in line with market conditions. We also expect to restart projects that have been suspended across this time horizon, but if necessary, can be delayed longer, further deferring spend. We also have a level of early investments that fund long-term growth opportunities. These two can be deferred or suspended. While each of these reductions impact the value of our plan they are available as circumstances warrant. Less flexible spend can also be reduced, but at a higher cost. This capital is generally longer cycle, more firmly committed or very near completion. The next slide helps quantify our capital flexibility. On the left of this graphic, we show available cash from operations for our 2021 plan at different rent prices, assuming the lowest refining and Chemical margins experienced from 2010 to 2019. This is our source with higher crew prices generating more available cash. As you move right, you see our uses, the current dividend and our 2021 CapEx from the previous page. As you can see, the breakeven Brent price needed to pay our dividend and invest in the low end of our flexible capital is roughly $45 a barrel. The Brent price required for 16 billion, which is the low end of our guidance and closer to where I expect our actual spend to be in 2021, is $50 a barrel. With Downstream and Chemical margins at the bottom of the 10 year historical range, we can fund our highest return investments in Guyana, the Permian in the Chemical business, and begin paying down debt at Brent prices, just above $50 a barrel. If Downstream and Chemical margins were at their 10 year averages, Brent breakeven prices would be roughly $5 a barrel lower, which would allow us to fund investments, pay the dividend and pay down debt at Brent prices above $45 a barrel. As we look at the market year-to-date actual prices in margins in total are above our plan, allowing us to progress our investments, pay the dividend and begin paying down debt in the first quarter. Obviously we\u2019re very early into the year and we know the market will change. We\u2019re keeping a close eye on developments and we\u2019ll adjust our capital spend accordingly, protecting the strong dividend and preserving the balance sheet. Let\u2019s shift to a later year in our plan, 2025. By 2025, we expect Downstream and Chemical margins to be off their lows and closer to a long-term average. In this case, we used the average margins for 2010 to 2019. In addition, we will see the full benefits of the structural OpEx improvements and additional cash from the projects that come online by 2025. As you can see there is substantially more flexibility in our capital spend. As a result, our plans continue to cover the dividend and capital investments at Brent prices as low as $35 a barrel. At Brent prices above $50 a barrel, our capital allocation framework supports our planned investments, further debt reduction and/or shareholder distributions. So as you can see, our plans were robust to a wide range of price environments, and while we are optimistic that the recent improvements in the macro environment will continue, we recognize that much could change over the next four to five years. If we face a year where Brent prices remained below $50 a barrel on a sustained basis, we would reduce investments to levels more consistent with this year\u2019s plan. Recognizing the market uncertainty we\u2019ve attempted to strike the right balance between maintaining a strong dividend, fortifying the balance sheet to delever and continuing to invest in high return cash accretive projects. This last point is critical, particularly in a depletion business. The next chart gives a good perspective of this. Our investment strategy is focused on growing earnings and cash flow across a wide range of market environments. We are investing in advantage projects with some of the industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply. They grow earnings and cash flow in a variety of market environments. This graphic helps to illustrate this. Using IHS crude price and third-party margins, we expect the cash flow from project startups over our investment horizon to represent roughly 40% of our operating cash flow in 2025. This makes a critical point. You pay a significant long-term cost for excessive short term investment reductions.  And industry, does it collectively, the market pays with much higher commodity prices, striking the right balance, responding to short-term constraints with an eye on the mid to long-term generates the greatest value. Of course, in an investment portfolio of industry advantage projects is critical. The next slide provides a perspective of the investments we are making in developing Upstream resources, which represents the majority of our Upstream capital spend. This chart graphs cumulative Upstream capital spend to develop resources from 2021 through 2025 against the Brent price required for the investment to generate a 10% return, which we\u2019ve deemed our cost of supply. As you can see, our focus on high return, lowest cost of supply investments, generate a portfolio with a cost of supply well below $3 a barrel. In fact, almost 90% of our investments in developing Upstream resources have they cost the supply of $35 per barrel or less. These investments generate an average return using third party price outlooks in excess of 30%. So as you can see, striking right balance, progressing a very attractive portfolio of investments or maintaining our strong dividend in fortifying the balance sheet to delever is essential to maximizing value, both near term and long-term. When executed in period where others are pulling back and construction markets or slack, these investments become even more attractive. When you factor in the flexibility of our short cycle investments in the Permian where the value proposition continues to grow, we are well positioned. We have an attractive investment portfolio that we can flex with market conditions to strike the right balance across our capital allocation priorities. Let me now take a few minutes to highlight the progress we\u2019ve been making in the Permian. Despite challenging conditions and a rapid change in activity, our progress in the Permian exceeded our plan and its expectations. These improvements reflect the hard work of our people. The organizational changes made in 2019 and the continued evolution of our technology and techniques. In 2019, we better integrated the experience of our global drilling, technology and project organizations with the unconventional operating organization. Working together, they made a step change in performance that continues to improve. 2020 drilling rates were 50% better than our planned and more than 20% better than full year 2019 results. Drilling and completion costs were 15% below our plan and more than 25% lower than 2019 results. We estimate that roughly two thirds of the savings were due to improve performance. As an example, the number of frac stages achieved in a day increased by 30% versus 2019. As we enter 2021, we continue to see progress in our key performance metrics, further growing the value of this resource and improving upon our plans. In 2020, capital expenditures in the Permian were 35% below plan. Despite significant economic curtailments in the second quarter, 2020 volumes of 370,000 oil equivalent barrels per day exceeded our plan, about 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, above 2019. Going forward, with the pandemic related impacts on our balance sheet and market outlook, we are pacing Permian investments to maintain positive free cash flow, delever industry leading capital efficiency and achieve double digit returns at less than $35 a barrel. Based on the current market price projections our plans results in Permian volumes of approximately 700,000 oil equivalent barrels per day by 2025. If demand and prices are lower than current third-party outlooks, we\u2019ll adjust our plans. At a nominal Brent price of $50 a barrel through 2025, we would expect to deliver an additional a 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2025 versus 2020 production levels. Key point here is that we have flexibility in options, which I expect to improve with time. We\u2019ve been making significant progress in our technology programs, which are contributing to current performance. With the advances we are making, I expect continued improvements in productivity, growing volumes at even lower cost. Hopefully, the Permian discussion and broader overview of our investment plans provided a useful perspective on the opportunities we have and the balance we are attempting to strike across our capital allocation priorities, amid an uncertain market outlook. I\u2019d like to move on to the results we\u2019ve achieved in lowering our emissions and the plans we have for further reductions, but before I do, I\u2019d like to recap some key points. Our portfolio offers the best collection of investment opportunities we\u2019ve had in over 20 years. We have some of industry\u2019s lowest cost of supply projects with strong returns that are robust to low prices. Coupled with our expense efficiencies, our capital program through 2025 improves the earnings power and cash generation potential of our asset base in both the near and long-term. Leveraging our experience for 2020, we\u2019ve built flexible plans that will allow us to adjust to market developments and potentially lower prices. If prices move higher than our plan basis, this will allow us to more quickly replenish our balance sheet. Our plans strike the right balance, growing value, maintaining strong dividend and a fortified balance sheet that is delevered over time. Let\u2019s turn to our work and position the company for a lower carbon energy future. Addressing the risk of climate change is one of society\u2019s biggest challenges, requiring the combined effort and collaboration of governments, academia, businesses and consumers. ExxonMobil has spent decades researching new technologies and deploying existing ones to lower our emissions and the emissions of our customers. Today, we remain committed to this. We plan to position ExxonMobil as a leader in our industry. Since its inception, we have supported the goals of the Paris Agreement, engaging in climate-related policies and supporting a tax on carbon. Since 2016, the year of the Paris Agreement, we\u2019ve reduced our operating greenhouse gas emissions by 6%. Last year, we met the reduction objectives we set in 2018. And in the fourth quarter announced new emission reduction plans for 2025 that are consistent with the goals of Paris. Our plan to reduce emissions from operated assets and align the company with the World Bank\u2019s initiative to eliminate routine flaring. To reduce the intensity of our operating upstream greenhouse gas emissions, we drive a decrease in methane intensity and a decrease in flaring intensity. This is expected to reduce absolute upstream greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 30% and absolute methane and flaring emissions by 40% to 50% versus 2016 levels. Our plans continue to invest in lower emissions initiatives, with an expect to spend up more than $500 million a year. This includes energy efficiency, TCS investments, cogeneration, research and development and renewable purchases, an area where we already make a significant contribution. Today, we are the second largest buyer of wind and solar power in the oil and gas industry and among the top 5% across all corporations, purchasing roughly 600 megawatts. While we don\u2019t bring a significant competitive advantage to many wind and solar projects, we can leverage our size to support world scale developments with purchase contracts hoping to ensure they are built. We\u2019re also the world\u2019s leader in carbon capture, responsible for over 40% of the CO2 capture. To put this into context, the nature conservatory announced a campaign in 2008 to plant a 1 billion trees. Our cumulative CO2 capture is more than double that goal. We\u2019re also one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydrogen. As the potential for this and the energy transition develops, we are well-positioned to leverage our experience, scale and technology to contribute. In fact, to ensure that we effectively leverage all of our technologies, experiences and expertise, yesterday we announced the formation of a new business, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This business will focus on advancing commercial CCS opportunities and deploying emerging technologies as they mature. I\u2019ll come back to our plans for this in a moment as we expect it to underpin our long-term strategy in driving emission reductions. I want to first focus on the progress we\u2019ve already made. As you can see in this chart, since the inception of the Paris Agreement, ExxonMobil has made significant progress in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, down 6% significantly outpacing the progress made by society as a whole. Over the past 20 years, we have invested more than $10 billion to research, develop and deploy lower emissions energy solutions, resulting in highly efficient operations. During that time, we eliminated or avoided about 480 million tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 100 million cars. The plans we announced in December further reduce the intensity of our businesses, delivering an expected reduction in emissions of roughly 12% by 2025. I want to pause here for a minute and emphasize that these are not targets. These reductions are built into our base plans. In conjunction with the reorganizations completed in 2019, we established a more rigorous process to capture emission reduction efforts at operating units around the world. Plans developed in 2020 leverage this process and built in additional efficiency steps and accretive investments to deliver these reductions. Like other plan objectives, the performance of our businesses and our senior management will be evaluated based on achieving these commitments. I think it\u2019s important to point out that our plans are in line with the stated ambitions of the Paris Agreement, which you can see on the next chart. This slide overlays both global and ExxonMobil emissions since 2016 with the goals of the Paris Agreement, hypothetical 1.5 degree and two degree Celsius pathways. As you can see, our plans are consistent with the stated ambitions. Of course, the challenge will be maintaining our progress into the future for both ExxonMobil and society at large. Today, the set of solutions available in overcoming this challenge is incomplete. There is a gap between what is needed and what is available. This is illustrated by the 2016 Paris submissions shown by the green diamond, which is an estimate of the signatories nationally determined contributions. We are working to close this gap and help provide solutions for society. Our investment in R&D is focused on the world\u2019s highest emitting sectors, manufacturing, commercial transportation and power generation, which together account for 80% of global energy related carbon emissions and where today\u2019s alternatives are insufficient. As I said earlier, through 2025, we expect to invest more than $3 billion in lower emissions initiatives, which include energy efficient process technology, advanced biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, which is a crucial technology for achieving the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Carbon capture and storage is expected to play an important role in addressing emissions from difficult to decarbonize sectors. This is also generally recognized as one of the only technologies that can enable negative emissions. And the two degree scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is estimated that in 2040, 10% of total energy will require CCS. It\u2019s also estimated that 15% of global emissions will be mitigated by CCS. If carbon capture and storage does not progress and play a significant role in decarbonizing the economy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates the society\u2019s cost of achieving a two degree outcome would more than double, increasing the cost by 138%. In short, the world is unlikely to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement without focused action and the innovation in carbon capture and storage. Unfortunately, according to the IEA, its development and deployment are not on track. This is an area where we can potentially leverage unique capabilities to make a difference. ExxonMobil has been the global leader in carbon capture for more than 30 years. We believe there is an opportunity to leverage our deep operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution skills, subsurface expertise and ability to scale technology to uniquely contribute in this area. In 2018, we formed a carbon capture venture to identify and develop potential CCS opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies. This group has been working with governments, industry, academia and tech companies to advanced projects. Today, we have more than 20 opportunities under evaluation. With increasing government focus, growing market demand and additional investor interest, we are increasing our emphasis in this area through the establishment of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. This new business will continue to progress the ongoing venture work, while looking to expand other commercial opportunities from our extensive low carbon technology portfolio. The business will focus its efforts on solutions critical to achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, work with governments around the world to promote the necessary policies and regulatory frameworks and partner with interested parties to achieve improvements at scale.  While new, this business will hit the ground running, incorporating the existing venture organization and a healthy pipeline of potential opportunities. We look forward to sharing more information as this effort advances. Before we open the lines for your questions, let me close by reiterating our areas of focus. Delivering world class safety and reliability, driving structural cost reductions, advancing a flexible portfolio of high return, cost advantage investments, maintaining the strong dividend and fortified balance sheet and reducing emissions while developing needed technologies to support the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Our people delivered in these areas last year, despite the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. I\u2019m absolutely confident they will deliver even more this year and into the future. I hope I\u2019ve given you a deeper understanding of our strategy and plans for 2021 and beyond. I look forward to providing you with more detail during our March Investor Day and as the year progresses. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Stephen Littleton : Thank you for your comments, Darren. We will now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woods and Mr. Littleton. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Doug Terreson with Evercore ISI. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. Stephen Littleton : Good morning, Doug. Darren Woods : Good morning, Doug. Doug Terreson : Darren, Exxon Mobil\u2019s equity has outperformed S&P Energy and S&P 500 too since the new capital management plan was announced in November. And as you guys have posted further progress on restructuring exploration and environmental plans too, we did have some industry help along the way. But on this point, it seems like you\u2019re pretty encouraged about the outperformance that you\u2019ve seen on the structural efficiency component that you talked about earlier today. And that divestitures, which are another part of the capital management program probably recover, but in a better price environment. So, my question is whether or not you agree with my characterizations of these two items and also whether or not you have any additional color or specifics on these parts of the capital management program, which make you optimistic about performance in those areas? Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Doug. Thanks for the question. And before I answer that let me just take a minute to congratulate you on your pending retirement, well-earned... Doug Terreson : Well, thank you. Darren Woods : I miss having you in the mix. Doug Terreson : Well, thank you. Darren Woods : With respect to your comment and the delivery of some of the improvements we\u2019ve made, I just maybe step back and provide a little perspective on the journey we\u2019ve been on, as we looked at the business and focused on the opportunities to improve performance over time, we recognize the need as a capital-intensive industry to make sure that we had a very healthy and attractive set of capital investment opportunities, which is what we focused on at the beginning to recognize the size of that opportunity and the leverage that it gives us with respect to earnings and cash flow. And so, as you heard, early on with my tenure that\u2019s what I was focused. We generated a very, very attractive set of investments. At the same time, we were progressing an organizational restructuring, the move from this functional organization that we had put in place at the time of the merger of Exxon Mobile, which served its purposes and added a lot of value at the time as we brought those two companies together. But with time, recognize the need to move to an organization that had a better line of sight end-to-end on the business and a more direct accountability for profit and loss. And we completed that transition in 2019. And I think, last year in the March analyst meeting, I mentioned that we were focused on taking advantage of the new organization to drive efficiencies. And I would say 2020 delivered on that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we see more opportunity down the road and have actually built into our plans for 2020 these improved efficiencies. And so that\u2019s what I would tell you is the foundation of the plans that we\u2019ve got and the improvement opportunities that we see going forward independent of where the market takes us. Then on top of that, obviously, and as we said back in our third quarter call with where the impact of the pandemic and the price response to the loss of economic activity, we recognize that that had to be a temporary downturn, just because of the fundamentals associated with the industry and wanted to make sure that we prepared ourselves for what would be an eventual recovery recognizing the timing of that is somewhat uncertain. And I would say, as we sit here today, I\u2019d still characterize as somewhat uncertain, although encouraging here over the last several months. But we haven\u2019t -- we\u2019re not kind of taking that to the bank, so to speak, we\u2019re prepared and keeping an eye on how the market develops and we\u2019ll respond accordingly. So, I feel good about where we\u2019re at today. I think we\u2019ve got our company in a position and our organization, focused on the right things. And then we\u2019ve got an opportunity set with flexibility that we can execute as we go forward. And as I said, as I look at the first quarter where we\u2019re ahead of where we thought we were going to be and we\u2019ll already start to delever and continue to progress our investment. So, I feel as good as you can given some of the uncertainty out there with the residual pandemic effects. Doug Terreson : Yes. And then, Darren, you guys made the most asset-rich company in our sector. And last year was kind of an impossible year to even think about selling assets probably. But you have a lot to work with. And so spend a minute on that too on divestitures and progressing that plan? Darren Woods : Right. I think, as you saw last year when we\u2019ve been talking about, we\u2019re really trying to focus the activity on the highest value, highest return, lowest cost of capital at which has meant prioritizing investments and high-grading the portfolio. So, we announced a divestment program, something that we hadn\u2019t historically not done and have been out prosecuting that divestment program. Doug Terreson : Okay. Darren Woods : We\u2019ve got assets in the market today. But as we said at the time we announced it and continues to be the underlying principle associated with a divestment program is -- it\u2019s a value-driven program. So, we\u2019re looking to make sure that we can find a buyer that values the assets, cease more opportunity than we can prosecute with the asset. And so that is what drives the decision.  Obviously, last year with all the uncertainty, wasn\u2019t a whole lot of activity in this space, although we did make some progress. We have mechanisms with respect to the deals that can accommodate some of the price uncertainty, and that\u2019s going to continue on -- I would say as the market recovers and people\u2019s views develop more fully, I expect we\u2019ll have additional advancements in that program. Doug Terreson : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Darren Woods : Thank you, Doug. Best of luck. Operator : We will go next two Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, guys, and thank you for the incremental disclosure. Lots of interesting stuff to unpack. I guess, the first question is I just wanted to confirm, did you say you expect to be on the low end of the $16 billion to $19 billion band this year? And then the follow-up around that is you\u2019re at $67.6 billion of gross debt. Is there an absolute level that you guys are gunning for here when it comes for -- comes to your gross debt level? Darren Woods : Good morning, Neil. Yes. I will confirm my -- that was the comment I made. I do expect to be on the lower end of that range. And then, our plan with respect to debt -- we talked about in the third quarter, we kind of set a hard limit of around $70 billion. We didn\u2019t want to go above that and working hard to bring that down, expect for that to come down in the first quarter. And we\u2019ll continue to work to bring that down to really rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. There\u2019s one of the three capital allocation priorities, and we think absolutely critical to underpin the business we\u2019ve got going forward and to ride through the cycles that we face. And clearly, 2020 was a very deep down cycle, one that frankly, we\u2019ve never seen before. And I\u2019m pleased that the capital structure we had in place and our ability to respond to that unprecedented marketing environment that was very successful. We leveraged the use of the balance sheet, obviously, and we\u2019re now going to rebuild that to have the capacity we need to continue to weather the ups and downs of the cycles that we know will happen as we go forward. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Darren. And the follow-up is just your perspective on M&A, we -- yes, last year was as the busy one in terms of incremental E&P deal. Just how does Exxon think about the M&A landscape, the bid/ask right now? And certainly, the super major cycle that we saw in the late 1990s, early 2000s created a lot of value. There was some press speculation on that, and I\u2019m not sure what you can say, but conceptually, do you see the potential for major on major consolidation? Or is that too difficult to execute, given all the challenges of consummating that type of deal? Darren Woods : Yes. Sure, Neil. Obviously, I\u2019m not going to comment on speculation in the press. But what I would say is the approach that we take in this space has been pretty consistent. And we\u2019ve talked about that over the years. And it\u2019s really looking for value opportunities where there\u2019s another company that we can leverage synergies, leverage a different port -- differences in portfolios that basically have compliment one another. We look at a lot of things and that whole space we\u2019ve been active in that for quite some time. We continue to be active to look for opportunities to grow value, unique value. And that\u2019s kind of what drives in our mind the opportunity. And, as you know, we talked about that past, having always found opportunities that we felt were valued correctly or valued in line with what would be required to kind of extract unique value through an acquisition or a merger. But we continue to look in that space and it will be an active program going forward. Stephen Littleton : And if you don\u2019t mind I\u2019d probably add. The other thing that we look at and is the fact that it has to compete against our existing portfolio projects, which is industry leading best. So, when we look at any type of potential acquisition, we look compare it relative to some of our other investment opportunities notably an Upstream and Chemical space. Thank you, Doug. Darren Woods : Thank you, Neil. Operator : We will next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and happy New Year. I wonder if I could start off asking you to address the 800 pound gorilla driven [ph], which is obviously the criticism of the level that you and the management team by activists. I want to ask specifically to, how Exxon is responding, it seems to us disclosure, for example, in carbon capture and emissions reductions and your demonstrable capital flexibility are all something that perhaps has been overlooked in the past. I wonder if you could speak to how you\u2019re looking to address that and I\u2019ll go to follow up, please. Darren Woods : Sure. Well, good morning, Doug and happy New Year to you as well. What I\u2019d say is, last year clearly was unprecedented event something that forced some dramatic action in the industry as a whole and our company. And as we leverage the new organization and reconfigured our plans in response to the pandemic and the consequences of that, we changed a lot of things and operating under a new set of constraints, obviously drawing down our balance sheet to the point that we did required a different approach going forward. And so that was the focus and rebuilding the plans for 2020. And as I\u2019ve said I think the organization as a whole responded very, very well to the challenging conditions, not only in operating our businesses in the environment, but at the same time, putting together very thorough well thought out plans for how we would go forward and accommodate the increased uncertainty and the recovery that we knew we had to make coming out of the pandemic. And frankly, If we put those plans together, we recognize that was a change from the past and our past plans and wanting to make sure that we effectively communicated that going forward. So, we had a very early release at the back end of the year after the Board approved the plans that provided some perspective with the intent of coming into this call and more thoroughly taking the community -- investment community through more details of that plan. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing here. All the things we\u2019ve talked about, as you can clearly tell, if you look at the materiality of it and its work that\u2019s been underway for quite some time. I\u2019d say 2020 a lot of effort by the organization to put those together. And our intent is to make sure that we keep the outside community kind of up-to-date with those plans given the constraints that we\u2019re operating under. Doug Leggate : I realize it\u2019s not an easy question to answer, so I appreciate the clarity. But let me just pick up on one issue as my follow-up, and it\u2019s on cost flexibility and the dividend. Because it seems you\u2019re -- I don\u2019t want to say unequivocal, but you\u2019re certainly providing a great deal of emphasis on the sustainability of the dividend. So, I wonder if you could just speak to that. I think you answered, maybe talk to the inflection in non-productive capital, because you have spent ton of money on things that it seems to just about to get to that inflection, which can support that perception of dividend surety. So, I wonder if you could just address those issues now we get there. Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. I think -- so, we\u2019ve built the plan based on the three capital allocation priorities I touched on as part of my prepared remarks and try to optimize the value to the corporation, recognizing that if you look at the portfolio and the underlying strategy that we embarked on back in 2017/2018 timeframe, that remains in place. The even stress testing the projects and the investment opportunities we\u2019ve had we have in the portfolio continue to look attractive in this environment. You saw the Upstream portfolio, which is the biggest part of our spend show that. So, our intent then is to kind of pace that investment as we move forward, reflective of the market environment. And we\u2019ve structured the capital program, again, consistent with the experience that we had last year and the drawdown that we had in capital to make sure that we have flexibility to adjust. If you think about what we\u2019ve put in that flexible bucket, there is a large chunk of or a piece of short-term -- the short cycle investments in the Permian where we clearly have flexibility. We\u2019ve got pace projects, so things that are Global Projects organization as we were working to reoptimize the capital program, I think very cost-effectively and working with our EPC partners suspended some of that projects, but put them in warm standby so that we can start those back-up again. That\u2019s in our flexible spending. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got some longer term spend to fill the pipeline early on so that we\u2019ve got things as we move outside the plan period. So, all those things are -- and if we can make decisions in real-time about whether we continue to progress those or pull back in that area depending on what the environments at. And because we can do that and as we\u2019ve pointed out in these charts that we\u2019ve shown, we\u2019ve got lots of flexibility under different price environments to sustain the dividend. So, we feel really good about where we\u2019re at today that we\u2019ve got good upside with respect to growing the cash flow, as I\u2019ve showed. But at the same time, if we need to and the environment dictates, we can pull back. I think that\u2019s the optimal position as to develop options, to have the flexibility to adjust if you need to. We\u2019re very keen not to pull things back to a point where we didn\u2019t have plans to take advantage of the portfolio that we had if the market environment was better than what many were thinking of last year. So, our intent was build plans that are as best as possible what the market expects and then be positioned to pull down if necessary. Going in with no plan trying to ramp up is a lot harder than going in with a plan and coming down. Doug Leggate : I think your flexibility is underappreciated by a lot of people. Thanks so much, Darren. I appreciate the answers. Darren Woods : Great. Thank you, Doug. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Doug. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning, Darren. Darren Woods : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : So, first question and perhaps it\u2019s a signal of the times. But the charts around your flexibility only take the oil price up to $55 at this point, which is notable considering we\u2019re at $58 now. So, I\u2019m curious, is this message today, one, where we\u2019re supposed to be taking it as an official cap on the capital spending long-term in the $20 billion to $25 billion range, such that any additional cash flow in an upside case would be fully committed to debt reduction? You did mention shareholder distributions in one of those slides as well. So, just any incremental thoughts there. Darren Woods : Sure, Phil. I\u2019d kind of come back to we don\u2019t know where prices are going to go. And I think we have not tried build plans based on speculating where prices will go. Instead what we\u2019ve tried to do is build plans based on what a reasonable assumption is. And when I say reasonable, we test our price bases against kind of third-party and where the market -- generally the market is. And our expectation is to be kind of within and certainly on the lower end of the price expectations and that\u2019s how we build the plans. We recognized when we put that together that those prices probably aren\u2019t going to materialize and could be higher or lower and so they\u2019ll have flexibility in. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into how high we went on that chart. I mean it\u2019s kind of just a -- it was a number that we pick. The higher it goes, the better off obviously we\u2019re at. And I would tell you our first priority above and beyond the plan if we see a price environment that\u2019s higher than we have anticipated, it would be to continue to delever and to rebuild the strength of the balance sheet. Because again I would tell you -- and as I\u2019ve talked about today and in the past, balancing across the three capital allocation priorities is absolutely critical and you take different decisions in the short-term. Last year when we recognized we were in a very deep downturn, one that we also believe would be temporary, prioritized the dividend and made sure that we continue to pay that and grew on the balance sheet. As we come out of that, which is what we expected, our plan is to rebuild the balance sheet so that we can be in a position going forward to absorb what other shocks come in the future. And at the same time, we wanted to make sure that we are continuing to invest in these accretive projects, because ultimately they are going to underpin the long-term success of the corporation. So, I\u2019d say the key word as we work through the last year is balance. And I\u2019d say the other one is optionality, flexibility. And that\u2019s what the plan now reflects and what we\u2019ve talked about today. Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. My follow-up question would be around Slide 30 and your commentary about how the first quarter is shaping up. Obviously, on this slide the only area where the margins are well below the low end of the range is on Downstream. And based on your long history in that business and how you\u2019re seeing things today specifically for Downstream, would you say that the margins right now are consistent with low end of the range and kind of the $3 billion annualized uplift that you\u2019re talking about? I recognize you made a comment that in totality you are there, but I\u2019m specifically thinking more about the Downstream? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes. What you see on the Downstream in that chart 30, we\u2019ve put a kind of a January estimate and there is some kind of where we are at currently, and it\u2019s still well outside that historic range. So, I think today if you look at the industry as a whole across the globe where margins are at, it\u2019s not a sustainable position just because of the losses that are accruing. And if you look back in history, I think, there is a certain physics associated with these businesses that say, it can only go so low before you\u2019re not covering your cost and you\u2019re bleeding cash, so you\u2019re going to have to make adjustments. And that historical range, in my mind, kind of sets those limits. I mean, these are commodity businesses. And if you take a price that goes below the marginal cost of supply, it\u2019s going to end up costing industry as a whole and eventually players will rationalize and drop out. And that -- for as long as I\u2019ve been in the Downstream, that business has been long supply and it\u2019s a slow process to rationalize it tight, particularly as more refineries come on out in Asia. So, I think what you\u2019re seeing there is the time cycle associated with rebalancing the markets and the supply demand balance. Obviously, demand is off pretty significantly what was already kind of marginally long business. So, it\u2019ll be a function of demand coming back and how quickly that recovers and then continued rationalization. As Stephen said, we\u2019ve seen last year much higher levels of rationalization and my expectation would be if we don\u2019t see the margins recover backed within that band, you\u2019ll continue to see that. Phil Gresh : Got it. And do you think we\u2019ll get there in 2021 towards the low end at some point? Darren Woods : I think it\u2019s very dependent upon how the recovery goes, how the economies pick back up again. I think it\u2019s -- there is a mix view and we\u2019ve tried to be pretty conservative in our planning just recognizing the mechanisms required to rebalance the market that\u2019s going to take time. My expectation is the second half of the year will look a lot better than the first half. But exactly where we end up on that bar, I think it\u2019s tough to tell. I think, eventually, we will get back there. If not, back into this year, sometime into next year and potentially see an overcorrection, so to speak, as demand continues to pick up and with the reduced supply, we\u2019ll see that tightness in the supply demand marketplace self out in the Downstream is what I would expect. The challenge with all these things -- I\u2019m talking about very fundamental things. It\u2019s not a question of if that\u2019s going to happen, but when. And I think that\u2019s -- I think the trick in this game and our view is you should recognize it\u2019s coming, but not build the plan based on the hope that it does. Phil Gresh : Great. Thanks, Darren. Look forward to more updates in March. Darren Woods : Thank you, Phil. Operator : The next to Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you. Thank you Darren for taking the questions. The first one is on the announcement around CCS. I mean, it seems to me is that you\u2019ve taken your time the step into it is a considered one. And I guess it must be based at least with a view that the prospect of the business there. And so, my question was, what do you think has to happen or are you able to describe some of the steps that have to happen, both technologically and regulatorily fiscally to get us from where we are now to something that looks like a genuine business opportunity? And the second question, if I ask a follow-up as well at the same time. Just on CapEx, is it fair to characterize the level of CapEx that you need to address one of those three objectives that you had, which is to sustain the dividend over the very long term, but CapEx needs to be in that 2021 to 2025 and the current level of spend that you\u2019re projecting for 2021 is more around about protecting the balance sheet and therefore not a sustainable level of CapEx in the long-term consistent with your payout? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes. Sure, Jon. So, on the CCS, I think -- and as I indicated and as I\u2019ve talked, I think for as long as I\u2019ve been publicly speaking about this is, we\u2019ve recognized that carbon capture and storage is a critical element to achieving the ambitions of Paris Agreement. And one of the things that we\u2019ve noticed over time is -- and I think the IEA described it as momentum in this space is that we\u2019re beginning to see a broader recognition of the importance of that technology. I think the industry for a long time is recognized, but I think more broadly it\u2019s being recognized as an important part of the solutions set in terms of achieving the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. So, we\u2019ve been working for quite some time on the technology and trying to address the cost side of that to find a technology that was lower in cost, which would then make the opportunities more attractive and accelerate the deployment of CCS. And so, a lot of work over the years on the -- what I\u2019d say is the fundamental process technology in the way that can actually concentrate CO2. And as we look at that portfolio, we\u2019ve been advancing. There is more work to be done there for sure, still technology developments that we\u2019ve got to progress. But we\u2019re now seeing, I think, with the increased recognition of the need for this technology, governments being more amenable to and understanding and recognizing the need for policy frameworks and regulatory frameworks, legal frameworks to support establishing CCS. We\u2019re seeing investor demand, where people are interested in investing those types of projects. So, I think there is money that\u2019s looking for opportunities to reduce carbon emissions. And then there is a market growing for reduction credits. We see a lot of things, a lot of market developments and momentum in the market as a whole, which all contribute to building a sustainable business. And so, we felt like, given where things we want to, now is the time to bring a more concerted effort in this space and start making sure that we\u2019re staffed and we\u2019ve got people working hard, engaging with governments to help move all those things along. If you look at that portfolio of products that we\u2019ve got today, one of the biggest challenges is in the policy and regulatory framework space. And so, that\u2019s a real focus area. And I think certainly here in the U.S. we\u2019ve got an administration that\u2019s interested in progressing in this space and we\u2019re there and are ready to talk with them and help provide some perspective from an industry standpoint. We think the timing is right and we think we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve put the right people in this new organization to kind of move that forward. But it will be I think this is a complex area. There are a lot of variables at play that we\u2019ve got to bring together and we need to make sure that we got our senior management focused on bringing those things together. On your CapEx, 2021 CapEx, you\u2019re right, that is the low CapEx number for us. In fact, if you look at the history and going back in time since Exxon and Mobil merged, it\u2019s the lowest level of capital spend that we\u2019ve had in any year. And so, I think it\u2019s fair to say, just using history as a guide that that\u2019s probably not a sustainable level of CapEx. And it is a response to the environment that we found ourselves in and the recovery that we\u2019re making coming out of that environment. And I think longer term going forward, which is one of the reasons why our 2022 through 2025 range in guidance is higher. It\u2019s just a recognition that in a more steady state environment, the spend needs to be higher to support kind of the growth and to underpin the capital allocation priorities we have. Jon Rigby : Makes sense. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet Jonathon. Operator : Over next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you for following on me. Darren Woods : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : I did want to dig into commercialization of carbon capture a little bit, because there is a few paths you could just sell carbon credits where applicable, but it also integrates with the rest of the business in an interesting way, particularly gas in terms of customer overlap and bundling opportunities. I know it\u2019s early days. But can you just talk about that as something that\u2019s kind of leading the way in this commercialization effort? How it overlaps with the existing business? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes. Sure. I think the point you make, Sam, is the one maybe I was trying to hit on with Jonathon is, this market demand in terms of people looking for cleaner options and offsets and emission reduction steps. And so, we think there\u2019s an opportunity there with that with many of our -- the products in our portfolio. And we see that across, frankly, all of our sectors, the Downstream, you mentioned gas, we certainly see that there in gas and we see opportunities from -- in terms of our recycling or environmentally improved footprint in the Chemical business as well. So, I think, that -- as I mentioned, the momentum that we\u2019re seeing broadly in this space is opening up market opportunities, which we think this business can take -- get engaged with and make sure that we are contributing where we can. I mentioned, these -- to make a difference and move the needle, there needs to be fairly broad investment over time and we have a lot of capabilities that lend itself to that. Not only do we have the technology work that we\u2019ve been doing, we\u2019ve got a projects organization that knows how to scale up technologies and apply. Then we have a manufacturing footprint that we can take advantage of. We\u2019ve got a very good understanding of subsurface and how that works. We\u2019ve got midstreams in pipeline. So, we -- if you look at the different elements that have to go into successfully building a CCS business is very consistent with what we do today and very much in our wheelhouse. So, we see that as an opportunity. And frankly, the challenge has been the development of the market and the needs here. And again as we see the momentum in that grow, we see that opportunity. So I think that\u2019s the work and what we're focused on doing here. Sam Margolin : Thanks. And then just as a follow-up in terms of scale and the addressable market here, your slide on carbon capture as a percentage of the total carbon offset targets around 15%. Let\u2019s say, Exxon in your 2019 Sustainability Report, you have about 120 million tons of Scope 1 and 2. Emissions -- is the 15% number of that kind of a reasonable scope, call it, like 18 million tons potentially of scalability here, is that kind of the way you're thinking about it? Darren Woods : Well, I would tell you, in part forming this -- moving from venture to a full blown business is the -- one of the advantages within the company is that brings that business into our plan process where we can put together marketing and business plans, put together annual plans and lay all that opportunity. And I would tell you, Sam, this is the year that we will do that with this business. We\u2019ll give Joe a chance to get in the chair and then get his organization focused on marketing and business plan and then translating that into our company plan process and then at the end of the year we\u2019ll have -- we\u2019ll start to kind of track that like we do all the other businesses. And so, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a question that we\u2019ll answer as we go forward and look at these opportunities, made a big variable in all of this is just, there is a lot of things that have to come together to make these things move and progress. And so, part of it is a function of how that external market moves, part of it\u2019s a function of how quickly the governments respond and put in the right kind of regulatory and policy frameworks. And so, I think it\u2019s a complicated space, but it\u2019s one that a very consistent with what we've historically done. And so, I feel pretty optimistic that we can come in and contribute and actually help in this space, and it\u2019s very consistent with our competencies and capabilities. And so, this is the space that we feel like where we can contribute and help society reduce their emissions. So -- but I would say stay tuned, there is a lot of work that has to happen here. And as we develop that, we\u2019ll be sharing with you how we see that the potential here and how these opportunities are developing. Sam Margolin : Thank you so much. Darren Woods : Thank you, Sam. Stephen Littleton : Operator, I think we probably have time for one more caller. Operator : Yes. It looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question will be from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. Appreciate it. Darren Woods : Good morning, Devin. Devin McDermott : So, I wanted to maybe first follow-up on the line of questioning here on the low carbon business. And the last few questions are on the carbon capture side, but you mentioned some other opportunities in hydrogen and biofuels. And I was wondering if you just elaborate on the types of projects and technologies that you\u2019re focused on advancing there. And then as part of that, if you think about this low carbon spending that you\u2019ve planned in the next few years, are there pockets of opportunities across these businesses that are starting to compete for capital with the legacy Upstream, Chemicals and Downstream spending that you have in the capital program, and where are those biggest opportunities looks tangible in the near-term for scale and capital? Darren Woods : Yes. I would say -- so we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve had a very active technology portfolio across this whole space. You may recall in the past, I\u2019ve talked about our energy centers, we\u2019ve got around the world where we\u2019ve partnered with universities, very focused on investing in areas where we see the potential for alternatives. Biofuels is an area where we\u2019ve got a number of different technology drives to for -- to see if we can develop more cost effective biofuels that work at scale. A lot of work in process technology and how we take existing processes and make them more energy efficient, less emissions associated with them. So, trying to leverage some of the new materials that are out there. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve got a really broad spectrum of opportunities we\u2019ve been working on. We\u2019ve got relationships with 80 universities where we\u2019re not necessarily steering that technology work, but we are participating in it. And as we see those technologies advance and look -- and get higher potential -- have a higher potential of those things, we would look to try to bring into the portfolio. So, we got -- what I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve cast a pretty wide net around the technology space, recognizing that it\u2019s requiring some level of evolution, if not, breakthroughs in technologies for them to be successful. And so, since you can\u2019t really plan for that we kind of keep our finger on the pulse of a lot of different technologies with the intent then to -- as they look more promising, but it bring them into the emerging and then commercial technology space. And so, that\u2019s the work that this new group will be focused on. And again, we\u2019ll complement what we\u2019re doing in the carbon capture and storage. We\u2019ve got the biofuels work that we\u2019ve been doing, and we\u2019ve got the process technology work that we\u2019ve been doing and a lot of those things overlap with one and other. Certainly -- and, of course, that then also has hydrogen and the process technology work we\u2019re doing and the CCS work together have a lot of overlap with potential for hydrogen generation. So, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the space that we tend to be working on from a technology standpoint. And then with respect to the spend, this is a long-term focus area for our facilities and businesses. And you can see from the progress we\u2019ve made with reducing greenhouse gases, it\u2019s not something new, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been after -- year after year after year and those opportunities continue to present themselves. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that with the new organization and new processes that we\u2019ve put in place, we\u2019ve got more direct and better line of sight to those opportunities that we can make sure they\u2019re getting funded and moving forward and that\u2019s all built into our plans and is built into our 2025 objectives that we\u2019ve laid out. Devin McDermott : Great. Thanks. Very helpful detail. And sounds like a lot of exciting opportunities. My follow-up -- hopefully, a quicker one here. As you think about just the capital spending range over the next several years of $20 billion to $25 billion and contextualize that with the analysis that you had in the slides on the amount of cash flow contribution in 2025 and some of the new projects coming online. I was wondering if you could just help us pinpoint what level of spend that you think is required in order to just hold cash flow across the business flat over a multi-year period, understanding it\u2019s higher than the 2021 stand, some are within that $20 billion to $25 billion. Anyway, we can fine-tune that estimate a little bit in terms of the maintenance CapEx, the whole cash flow steady? Darren Woods : Yes. Well, I think the way we tend to look at it is, how you maximize the value. And we don\u2019t have an objective of finding old volumes or any other metric, it comes back to -- if -- what are the projects that we have available to us, the investments. What are the returns that we think we can generate from those investments? What advantage do they have versus industry and within our own portfolio? How robust are they to the price environment? So, I would say, that as we look to build up our investment profile, it\u2019s understanding what the value of those investments are. And then putting those in the context of the constraints that we\u2019re operating under to see which ones get funded and how we prioritize them. So, I would say, 2020, one of the things given the impacts of coronavirus and role on our balance sheet is we\u2019ve really prioritized and focused on the highest value first. We still got a really deep portfolio that we will continue to advance as the circumstances allow and as the market allows, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to kind of go forward. And that range that we\u2019ve given in the outer years is indicative of what we think it would be required to continue to fund that very attractive set of investments. Again, I\u2019ll come back to you, though, if the market and the price environment is not supportive of that, that will be a constraint that continues to moderate that capital. And as I\u2019ve shown -- I showed on the chart, we\u2019ve got lots of flexibility, particularly as you move out into the outer years to pull back if we feel like that\u2019s the best thing to do given the environment that we find ourselves in. Make sure we continue to pay a very strong dividend and maintain a balance sheet that\u2019s going to allow us to ride through the cycles and continue invest. Those are the three things and I would just say there is no hard formula. It\u2019s responding to the current circumstances and making sure that we\u2019re striking the right balance, because each of those plays are really important part in the value proposition for the corporation. Devin McDermott : Understood. Thanks again for taking my questions. Darren Woods : Thanks, Devin. Stephen Littleton : Well, thank you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate you allowing us to opportunity to highlight fourth quarter results. We appreciate your interest and hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you and please stay safe. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in Exxon Mobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. I\u2019m pleased to welcome Darren Woods, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Exxon Mobil, who will be joining me for the call today. After I cover the quarterly financial and operational results, Darren will provide his perspective on the quarterly results and how we are positioned for 2021. Following those remarks, Darren and I\u2019ll be happy to address any questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on slide 2 and to the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I\u2019ll now highlight development since the fourth quarter of 2020 on the next slide. Across all three businesses, improved results reflect encouraging signs of the recovery from the pandemic as vaccinations are administered and some restrictions are lifted. In the Upstream, liquids and gas realizations improved significantly versus the fourth quarter. Production was higher driven by lower government mandated curtailments and higher seasonal gas demand in Europe. And as part of ongoing efforts to high-grade our portfolio, we announced the sale of most of our non-operated assets in the United Kingdom, Central and Northern North Sea. The sale price of more than $1 billion is subject to closing adjustments and has potential upside of approximately $300 million in contingent payments, based on commodity prices. In the Downstream, we continue to realize improvements in the North America refining margins. However, in Europe margins remained impacted by COVID lockdowns. While we have seen improved demand for gasoline and diesel, jet demand remains impacted by global travel restrictions. During the winter storm our Texas refineries were able to provide power to more than 200,000 homes through our cogeneration facilities. During the quarter, we announced the intent to convert both, the Altona Australia refinery and the Slagen refinery in Norway to fuel import terminals, as overall industry rationalization continues. In the quarter, there were approximately 500,000 barrels of industry rationalizations announced. In Chemical, tight industry supply, shipping constraints and strong demand resulted in global average margins improving to the top of the historic 10-year range. We were able to capture the benefits of these improved margins with strong reliability and the rapid recovery of our operations from the winter storm. In addition, we have continued to deliver further cost efficiencies. Across the corporation, improved prices and margins in addition to cost reduction initiatives, resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of more than $4 billion in the quarter. In February, operations across all three businesses were impacted by winter storm Uri. Repairs were completed and operations fully recovered by the end of the quarter. Finally, we established a low carbon solutions business to commercialize and deploy our portfolio of emission reduction technologies. The new business will initially focus on carbon capture and storage, one of the critical technologies required to achieve net zero emissions and the climate goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. Let\u2019s move to slide 4, for an overview of first quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of first quarter results relative to the prior quarter. First quarter earnings were $2.7 billion, including $31 million of identified items related to severance. Earnings, excluding identified items were $2.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion versus the fourth quarter. Despite the impacts of the winter storm, which you will see caught out in the table, earnings improved across all businesses, primarily due to higher prices and margins. There was a $300 million benefit in the quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives, for which the physical trading strategy has not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings impact of these trading strategies, when they close in the future. Also, we have continued to benefit from structurally lower operating costs, in all of our business lines. On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results. I will focus my comments on the underlying business performance, excluding identified items. Upstream earnings improved by over $1.8 billion in the first quarter with liquid realizations increasing by 42%, and gas realizations by 33%. The earnings change associated with volumes was negatively impacted by mix and timing effects, which offset higher production versus the prior quarter. Lower expenses including structural efficiencies, contributed approximately $170 million in earnings. On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of Upstream volumes. Upstream volumes increased by an average of approximately 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Gas volumes were 12% higher, mainly due to seasonal gas demand and lower scheduled maintenance. Liquids were down 3% with winter storm impacts and higher maintenance. Lower entitlements due to higher prices, negatively impacted volumes by approximately 40,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. Reduced government mandated curtailments increased volumes by about 60,000 oil equivalent barrels per day and gas demand was higher by approximately 70,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, mainly due to seasonal gas demand in Europe. Guyana and Permian production were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2020. However, compared to the first quarter of 2020, Permian production was approximately 20% higher excluding the impact of the winter storm, an average of around 395,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in the quarter. Guyana production increased by approximately 70% or 19,000 barrels per day over the same period. Moving to slide 7. Downstream earnings improved by over $300 million in the first quarter, despite the impacts of the winter storm. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $500 million as North America product demand continued to rebound. There was almost $400 million of earnings benefits from the expense reductions in the quarter, including structural efficiencies related to maintenance, optimization, logistics, and marketing. We also had unfavorable foreign exchange effects in the absence of prior period inventory impacts during the quarter. A reserve for announced terminal conversion is included in the other factor. Moving to Chemical on slide 8. Chemical had a strong quarter, delivering over $1.4 billion in earnings, more than a $700 million improvement versus the fourth quarter. Margins improved by $500 million, driven by tightly supplied polyethylene and polypropylene markets, impacted by the winter storm where at its peak, approximately 75% of U.S. polyethylene capacity was offline. Performance products demand into packaging and durable goods was resilient through the period. During the quarter, we had strong reliability, which positioned us to capture the improved margins. We continued to deliver cost reductions through turnaround and maintenance scope optimizations, contributing an additional $150 million to earnings in the quarter. On the next slide, I will summarize results versus the first quarter of 2020. Versus the first quarter of 2020, earnings increased by around $500 million. There was a total price margin improvement of about $1.3 billion, driven by higher Upstream prices and Chemical margins as the market recovered. This is partially offset by lower Downstream margins, but excludes the mark-to-market impact of unsettled derivatives, which was driven by the absence of a benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Cost reduction efforts, including structural efficiencies and maintenance, supply chain optimization, and the announced workforce reductions contributed over $1 billion of improvement to earnings. Moving to slide 10, I\u2019ll provide further details on our cost savings and CapEx reductions. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $9.2 billion in the first quarter, $1 billion lower than the same quarter last year. This reflects the significant structural improvements achieved in 2020 from our ongoing cost reduction initiatives. Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, on track towards the lower end of our full-year guidance. This reduction of over $4 billion versus the first quarter of 2020 was enabled by the flexibility of our short cycle unconventional assets and by our ability to pace Downstream and Chemical projects, consistent with market conditions. As Dan will cover later, we were able to do this, while preserving the long-term value of the opportunities. Moving on to a summary of cash flow on a slide 11. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this was up $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting our ability to capture higher prices and margins, and the results of our cost reduction efforts. We reduced debt by more than $4 billion, consistent with our capital allocation priorities. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 12, I will cover a few key considerations for the second quarter. In the Upstream, government-mandated curtailments are expected to be in line with the first quarter. We expect lower volumes with seasonal gas demand and higher maintenance. The sale of the UK Central and Northern North Sea assets is expected to close near midyear, subject to regulatory and third-party approvals. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement in line with third-party forecasts with jet continuing to recover at a slower pace than gasoline and diesel. Higher scheduled maintenance and turnarounds are planned for the quarter. In Chemical, we anticipate a tight supply and demand balance with ongoing industry maintenance impacting global supply, and we have higher planned turnarounds in the quarter. Corporate and financing expenses are anticipated to be about $600 million. And we expect to further reduce debt if price and margins remain at current levels. With that, I will now turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s good to be back with you. This time last year, I joined the call to discuss the challenges of COVID-19 and how we plan to respond. At that time, we were early in the pandemic, but the call to action was clear. We made some tough decisions and committed to bold actions. In our fourth quarter call, I reviewed our results, the success we had in meeting, and in some cases, beating those bold commitments. We made a lot of progress over the course of a challenging year. The positive results we announced today reflect not only last year\u2019s work, the work we started years ago, work that has positioned us to take advantage of market improvements. Today, I joined the call to put that work in context. I\u2019ll discuss the foundation for success that we\u2019ve laid and how it will manifest in growing shareholder value, value that will further materialize as markets continue to recover and as the world transitions to a lower carbon future. Our successful response to the unprecedented challenges of 2020 has its roots in two critical initiatives started years earlier. The first was our focus on developing an industry-leading portfolio of advantaged investments to recapitalize our businesses and increase capacity to generate earnings and cash. Prioritized investments in these opportunities last year are paying dividends this year and will continue to well into the future. The second initiative, which began in 2017 and was completed in 2019, was a significant restructuring of our businesses, reducing functional silos, organizing along value chains and consolidating competencies. This greatly reduced organizational complexity, interfaces and overhead. We provided a clearer line of sight to the market, increased ownership for earnings at all levels and improved the speed and quality of decision-making across the corporation. Importantly, it helped our people better relate their work to our bottom line results. We see the benefits of this in the first quarter results. Through structural changes, we\u2019ve permanently reduced operating expenses, capturing $3 billion in 2020 versus 2019, with further efficiencies in the first quarter and more expected through the year. In total, we expect to achieve $6 billion of annual savings by 2023 versus 2019. At the same time, we reduced emissions, operated safely and delivered best-ever reliability performance. Our focus in this area also paid off in the first quarter with a well-managed response to the Texas ice storms, minimizing impacts and speeding recovery. Throughout 2020, we worked to strike a difficult balance, dramatically reducing near-term spend without compromising longer term value. We used our balance sheet to maintain spending that was critical to shareholder value, including sustaining a strong dividend. We also maintained our work in advancing low-carbon technologies and developing projects with the potential to significantly reduce society\u2019s emissions. This work is crucial in underpinning our long-term future and in continuing to grow shareholder value. It also facilitated the launch of our Low Carbon Solutions business in the first quarter, a strategic business that we expect to grow with significant investments as we advance low-carbon technologies. We prioritized maintenance activities, ensuring essential work was completed last year and the remainder early this year, ahead of the anticipated demand recovery. We reduced 2020 CapEx by 30% versus our original plan. We did this by pacing project execution and leveraging our global projects organization to prioritize and optimally slow projects. We are continuing to pace projects to rebuild the balance sheet and pay down debt. In the first quarter, we made significant progress. Investments are in line with our outlook for the year of $16 billion to $19 billion, and debt was reduced by over $4 billion. Throughout this time, we\u2019ve never lost sight of the long-term fundamentals of our business. We knew economies will recover, populations and living standards would continue to grow, ultimately driving demand for our products and an industry recovery. Today, we are beginning to see this and are well positioned. Thanks to our efforts over the last few years, we are a stronger company with an improving outlook. You will, of course, recognize this chart, which we\u2019ve used since our third quarter call last year. At that time, we made the point that the pandemic had driven industry prices and margins to unsustainably low levels. And while hard to predict when that margins and prices would rebound. And today, we\u2019re seeing this rebound, which is happening faster than we thought and for some sectors, rising to higher levels than anticipated. The Upstream is back within the 10-year range with Brent prices improving by roughly 40% since the fourth quarter and natural gas up by about a third. In the Downstream, margins remain well below the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins, on the other hand, has swung from the bottom to the top. One thing is for sure, these margins and prices will continue to move. We\u2019ve based our plans on a conservative outlook and are positioning our businesses to be successful at or below the bottom of these ranges. At the same time, we\u2019re making sure that when the upswings come, we take advantage, which is why we went to great efforts to preserve our portfolio of investments while building in flexibility. It\u2019s also why we test each investment against a wide range of market scenarios and insist on structural advantages to generate leading returns at any price. Today\u2019s portfolio of opportunities is the best we\u2019ve seen in 20 years. 90% of our Upstream investments and resource additions over the next five years, including Guyana, Brazil and the Permian, generate 10% returns at $35 a barrel or less. In Guyana, we\u2019re continuing to progress Liza Phase 2. Payara is on schedule, and we\u2019ve begun planning for the next development, Yellowtail. The Bacalhau development offshore Brazil is advancing toward a final investment decision, and we\u2019re delivering greater efficiencies in the Permian, efficiencies that are driving down costs for drilling and completions while improving recovery rates and growing production. Based on these improvements and without additional capital, we\u2019ve increased our 2021 outlook to between 410,000 and 430,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day. The Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is ahead of schedule with a projected start-up in the fourth quarter. We expect to complete the project for about 25% less than the average cost of a Gulf Coast steam cracker. This facility is a key development in our plan to grow sales of high-value performance products by 60% through 2027. As we focused our activities on the highest value investments, we also worked hard to preserve the value of the projects we were pacing. As I mentioned, our global projects organization played a critical role in this, working closely with contractors, partners and resource owners to find efficiencies and reduce spend. Every project was reevaluated and tested against conditions informed by the pandemic, while all remained attractive and in our portfolio, the highest-value opportunities were given priority. Pace projects were evaluated for optimum breakpoints, with work continuing until these were reached. You can see this in the photos, which show the project status at the time the pandemic hit and when they were paused. Working closely with contractors, our team successfully offset deferral costs with efficiencies and market savings and preserved portfolio returns of greater than 30%. The CapEx outlook we provided incorporates resumptions of these project activities over time as the market recovers and we make progress deleveraging. Striking the right balance in our capital allocation priority was critical, as demonstrated by the price and margin chart. This was particularly true in the depleting businesses of the Upstream. The value of the choices made here are shown in the next couple of slides. We are excited by the results of the significant work and strategic investments made since 2017 to reshape our portfolio into one of the most price competitive in the industry, generating strong returns in a variety of price environments. Chart on the left, similar to the one used on Investor Day, shows the Brent price needed for upstream resource investments made in 2020 to generate a 10% return. As you can see, more than 90% of the investments require Brent price at or below $35 a barrel. On the right are the anticipated cash flows resulting from the projects retained in our 2020 investment program for this year and in 2025. As you can see, the investments we made in 2020 are making a significant contribution now and into the future. This is particularly true in the Permian, shown on the next slide. Last year, we reduced Permian CapEx by about 35%, but maintained a level of investment to support our technology efforts and drive improvements. This work contributed to an additional 100,000 oil equivalent barrels per day in 2020 versus 2019 and an increase of 60,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year. This work also drove significant progress across a number of variables, as shown on the left. Higher well productivity and lower costs resulted in positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year, which will continue through 2021. In addition, with the Poker Lake processing facility online and pipelines commissioned, we can ensure production is delivered to the highest value outlet at the lowest cost. Hopefully, these last two charts help illustrate the importance of striking the right capital allocation balance to preserve longer term value, particularly in trying times. Our first quarter results helped demonstrate this. We maintained our strong dividend, generated strong cash flow, delivered further cost reductions, remained flexible and disciplined in our capital spend, delivered excellent safety, environmental and reliability performance, and advanced solutions for a lower carbon economy. As we progress through this year, we\u2019ll maintain our capital priorities and a balanced approach. Our planned capital range for 2021 remains $16 billion to $19 billion with the outyears at $20 billion to $25 billion. If markets take an unexpected downturn, we have the flexibility to adjust. If margins and prices stay higher than planned, we\u2019ll deleverage faster, rebuilding the balance sheet. As the price and margin chart I reviewed earlier demonstrated, things can change quickly. A strong balance sheet remains a critical advantage in a capital-intensive commodity business. It also provides an important foundation for managing an uncertain future and the transition of the energy sector, which I\u2019ll turn to next. I\u2019ll start by restating our strategy and addressing the risks of climate change and the energy transition, a strategy based on four pillars we\u2019ve had in place for many years. It begins with mitigating emissions in our operations, which has been a focus for decades. Versus 2016, 2020 GHG emissions are down 11%. We met the methane and flaring reductions we committed to in 2018 and established aggressive emission reduction plans through 2025, putting us on a trajectory consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are committed to providing product to help customers reduce their emissions. Across the globe, we\u2019re helping economies decarbonize by providing natural gas for power generation, reducing emissions by more than a half versus coal. Our chemical products reduced vehicle weight, lowering transportation emissions and preserve shelf life of food, reducing waste and agricultural emissions. Our fuels and lube products, improve efficiency, also helping to reduce emissions. We\u2019re also proactively engaging on climate policy. We\u2019ve demonstrated this through our support for the Paris agreement and economy-wide price on carbon, consistent regulations to reduce methane emissions and frameworks to support investment in carbon abatement. And finally, we\u2019re focusing on developing and deploying scalable technology solutions that are needed to reduce emissions on a larger scale. We\u2019re focusing on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors of power generation, heavy-duty transport and industrial manufacturing. We\u2019ve launched our Low Carbon Solutions business to commercialize technologies and accelerate large-scale emission reductions in these areas. Since 2000, we\u2019ve invested more than $10 billion in lower emissions technologies and have plans to invest an additional $3 billion by 2025. Our initial emphasis is on carbon capture and storage, or CCS, a technology critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. I expect the magnitude of investments to grow as we work with industry, governments and communities to advance attractive project concepts that also generate shareholder value. Having said this, it\u2019s important to keep the current level of planned investments in perspective. When you compare the investment levels of our Upstream, Downstream and Chemical businesses with the size of their markets, our spend represents less than 0.3% of the total addressable market. We do the same for our planned investments in CCS. They represent over 3% of the total addressable market, more than 10 times the level of investments in our traditional businesses. We think this is reasonable given the early stage of this market\u2019s development. With our industry-leading position and decades of experience in CCS, we\u2019re well positioned to successfully compete in this growing and potentially large future market. As we tried to illustrate in this chart, today, we\u2019re the global leader in capturing CO2. In fact, we\u2019ve captured more anthropogenic CO2 than anyone in the world. We have an interest in over one-fifth of the world\u2019s CCS capacity and significant holdings in CO2 pipelines. Grass roots, large-scale CCS projects leverage our competitive advantages in technology and project management as well as decades of experience bringing new ventures to market. This is important, particularly for this potentially fast-growing large market, and it\u2019s why we launched the Low Carbon Solutions business, which is evaluating and advancing plans for more than 20 new CCS opportunities around the world. Last week, we introduced the concept of a multi-industry CCS hub to capture and store CO2 emissions from the heavy industry around the Houston Ship Channel. We think a carbon capture innovation zone, similar to an enterprise zone where incentives and policies are designed to encourage economic growth, is a smart way to advance this idea. We help bring together government incentives and private sector investments along with new policies and regulations that would encourage innovation. Houston is an ideal location for a major project. The plants along the heavily industrialized ship channel represents some of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. They\u2019re also relatively close together, providing project scale and reducing unit costs. Houston\u2019s proximity to the Gulf of Mexico also provides direct access to suitable storage locations. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the geology beneath the seafloor has the capacity to safely store all the CO2 that the entire country currently produces for the next 100 years. As currently envisioned, the project could capture 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and twice that by 2040. This would put Houston well on its way to reaching its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. This concept will need support from many different parties, both private and public. Regulatory and legal support at all levels of government will be crucial for establishing incentives and attracting investment. The federal government already provides some carbon reduction incentives such as tax credits for electric vehicle, wind, solar and CCS. Enhancing these credits or establishing a market price on carbon emissions, combined with appropriate rules and oversight, would accelerate solutions. We\u2019ve long talked about the importance of innovation. This multiuser hub concept is just one example of how we\u2019re looking to take on large, complex challenges and find solutions to help meet society\u2019s demand for a lower carbon future. This can play an important role in positioning the Company to deliver long-term shareholder value. The first quarter results clearly show that we\u2019re on the right path and well positioned for a continued market recovery. We will remain flexible while focusing on disciplined investing in high-return, competitively advantaged projects. This will provide the foundation for strong cash flows, a strong dividend and a strong balance sheet. We will remain relentless in structurally reducing costs by fully leveraging our new organization. We will continue to deliver industry-leading safety and reliability performance, meet our emission reduction plans, and help society transition to a lower carbon future, and we will do all this to grow shareholder value. I look forward to taking your questions. Stephen Littleton : Thank you for your comments, Darren. We\u2019ll now be more than happy to take any questions you might have. Operator, please open up the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woods and Mr. Littleton. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong results. Good to see some of the cost reductions and growth investments really paying dividends here in 2021. My first question is actually building on some of the last points you were making, Darren, on carbon reduction efforts in the Houston hub specifically. I think it\u2019s a very interesting concept, has a lot of potential. I was wondering if you could elaborate from a policy standpoint, what types of things are needed or policies need to be put in place in order to bring these types of projects to fruition. And then, are there other parts within your portfolio globally where there are already policies in place to make these types of investments viable today? Darren Woods : Sure. Thanks, Devin. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we\u2019re looking at doing in this space and reducing CO2 across economies is really establishing a new business, one that today doesn\u2019t have clear market drivers. And the governments have demonstrated, in other industries when they\u2019re looking to reduce CO2, they provide stimulus to catalyze advancements of new technology. I think the big difference with what we\u2019re talking about here versus some of the other initiatives that the government has supported is there\u2019s not an existing business or market that provides some level of financial incentives. And so, I think the work that has to be done with the government is aligning on the incentives to drive investments across industries to drop and lower the CO2 price. And we think we can do that and do it at a very attractive rate of return at much lower prices than what the government is currently spending to reduce CO2. If you recall from our Investor Day, we had a chart that showed the costs associated with reducing CO2 through carbon capture and compare that to the cost of CO2 removal through other mechanisms. And we have the opportunity to reduce significant levels of CO2 at a much lower cost than current policy. So, that will be an important part, policy to drive incentives. You\u2019ll need policies and frameworks to support the legal regime for storing CO2. We\u2019ll need permitting to put the facilities in place and run the pipelines. You\u2019ll need some frameworks to support the storage and access to the storage offshore. So, there\u2019s a number of areas that will need to be addressed. And then, obviously, we\u2019ll have to work with the industries involved here and work with them collaboratively to bring the CO2 in, and then also, of course, the communities that we\u2019ll be operating in. We\u2019ll have to work with them. And we think that\u2019s all possible. If you think about the work we do around the world in establishing new ventures, bringing new ventures to market, this is very consistent with our experience base. And I\u2019ll just point to Guyana, where essentially where we have started from grassroots, a brand-new oil and gas industry, working very closely with the government and community there in Guyana. So we\u2019ve got experience in this space. We\u2019ve got experience working in collaboration with other industry partners and experience working with governments to bring these complicated things together at scale and make a significant contribution. Devin McDermott : Great. That makes a lot of sense. And my second question is just on the cost reductions. So, you realized $3 billion last year. And if you look at the slide deck in the first quarter ray, you\u2019re down about $1 billion in the first quarter of \u201821 versus the first quarter of last year. So, annualized, a $4 billion reduction so far. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect the reductions to increase and move through this year, and I know you have a longer term target of $3 billion of incremental cost reduction. My question specifically though is, how should we think about the cadence of these cost reductions flowing through for the balance of this year and over the next few years. And as you\u2019ve embarked on these restructuring initiatives, have you found opportunities that might allow you to exceed this target over time, the $6 billion total target? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. I guess, let me just maybe start with where you ended and with respect to the $6 billion. And I just want to make the point, it\u2019s not a target. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve laid out and asked the organization to figure out how to achieve it. It\u2019s actually part of the plans that we\u2019ve built. And so, the organization has a clear line of sight to the reductions, and there\u2019s -- they\u2019ve built that into their plans. We\u2019re stewarding the businesses every month versus those plans. And so, we feel very good about what we\u2019ve identified and the work that we have going on. And the first quarter demonstrates that we are continuing to achieve the reductions. I would not take the first quarter results and try to multiply those and move them out. I think you\u2019re going to see things move with activities as you go through the year. But, my expectation is, the theme that you\u2019re seeing with these reductions will continue, and we will -- we\u2019re on track to deliver the $6 billion by the end of 2023. I guess, the final point I would make here, Devin, is my expectation, as we\u2019ve been working our way through this and translating those plans into action is we\u2019ll find more opportunities. I would expect it will beat the target of the plans that we put out there. We\u2019ve got work going on now that kind of goes across the corporation. I mentioned the fact that we have structurally change the way we run our businesses. That change has now aligned each of the sectors in terms of how we\u2019re organized and a lot of the processes that were used to execute the business. That gives us an opportunity to take advantage of this consistency and processes and execution and find additional efficiencies and synergies, and that work\u2019s underway, which we\u2019ll continue to develop as we move through this year, and I suspect we\u2019ll have more to talk about it as we finalize our plans for the year at the back end and into the next year\u2019s Investor Day. So, I\u2019m real optimistic that the groundwork that we\u2019ve laid since 2017 and looking at the businesses and how we reorganize are paying dividends today and are going to continue to pay dividends, well into the future. Stephen Littleton : I guess, Darren, if I can add, the other piece that we\u2019re seeing, Devin, is as we\u2019ve invested in technology, that\u2019s starting to see its benefits in terms of reducing our overall cost structure with the technology and IT investments. Operator : Next question will be from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : I hope you can hear me okay, because I think the storms here in Houston are affecting my connection a little bit. So, apologies\u2026 Darren Woods : You\u2019re loud and clear, Roger. Roger Read : Great. Darren, great performance this quarter from the Chemicals business. I know a lot of issues with storms, everything like that, some crazy moves in the pricing. I was just curious, do you think the Chemicals business is, in a sense, hit a reset here and this -- I don\u2019t want to say Q1 performance continues, but a much better than, let\u2019s say, the last six to eight quarters in this business. And as you think about that, is it mostly demand? Is it a pricing performance? We hear a lot of talk about inflation across the industry -- across industries, I should say. So, I\u2019m just curious what all we should think about with Chemicals. Darren Woods : Sure. And thanks for the question, Roger. I would say, the first quarter performance in Chemicals, first and foremost, reflects that organization\u2019s focus on running their operations reliably and safely, a lot of hard work to make sure that the integrity of the operations and the reliability of those operations are maintained. And we did a lot of work over last year. And I think moving into the first quarter. That focus has really helped our manufacturing facilities deal with the freeze and recover very rapidly from that. So, real proud of that effort. It wasn\u2019t easy, but that organization really delivered. I think the other thing it demonstrates is the focus that they\u2019ve had for several years on growing their high-performance products. And we knew that the demand for chemicals has been consistently strong and has been growing in excess of GDP growth around the world. And that fundamental, we think, will continue for some time since chemical plays such an important role in people\u2019s modern life and the convenience of the modern life and actually the critical importance of some of the products that chemicals make. Of course, the -- so the big challenge there though is as supply comes on in fairly large chunks, with different plants, that tends to result in supply and demand imbalances and lower margins. And of course, we saw that last year. And frankly, going into this year, we kind of anticipated a lot of capacity coming on, which would squeeze the margins and make for a challenging year. I think what we\u2019ve seen is with the impact of last year and the pullback in spending that was required due to the pandemic and then probably exacerbated by the Texas storm here with all the capacity in the Gulf Coast area, the supply has gotten pretty tight as demand has continued to move. And then, with the economic recovery and the rebound that we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s put some more demand into the system. So, it\u2019s -- I think the first quarter reflects good operations, good performance, good focus on growing our high-performance products and some really helpful market conditions from a supply and demand standpoint. My expectation as you move forward is we\u2019ll see some of that supply come back on, a recovery from the ice storms and some of this new capacity that was deferred will start to make its way back into the market, and that will help probably ease some of the tightness. But, our expectation is, we\u2019ll continue to see a pretty good market here this year for the Chemical business. Roger Read : And then, my other question, balance sheet. Obviously, you made the debt repayments this quarter commentary about excess cash will go towards debt repayments. Don\u2019t expect you to fix the balance sheet in one year, but kind of reaffirm for us where you\u2019d like to take the balance sheet over time, above and beyond just understanding you want to sustain the dividend, but like what\u2019s the right way to think about whether it\u2019s debt-to-EBITDA or debt-to-cap number, something along those lines? Darren Woods : Yes. Well, as we\u2019ve said, with our capital allocation priorities, there is three legs to the stool, so to speak. And, obviously, really important for the foundation of success for the future is investing in the right projects, particularly in the Upstream with the depletion nature of that business. We\u2019ve got to find industry advantaged investment opportunities. In the Chemical business, making sure that we\u2019re investing in the high-performance products that meet the demand, the growing demand that we\u2019re seeing around the world. And in the Downstream, investing in strategic sites to high-grade their production and make sure that the production is in line with the demand in the marketplace. And so, that\u2019s critical element, and that\u2019s something that we stay focused on as we went through 2020, making sure that we didn\u2019t compromise the value of that particular capital allocation priority. The dividend obviously a critical part of that, and sustaining that dividend was a commitment that we\u2019ve had for a long, long time, and we stay committed to that. So that\u2019s obviously going to be an important factor going forward. And then, the balance sheet is making sure that we maintain the capacity to ride through the commodity cycles and not compromise those first two priorities that I talked to you about. And that\u2019s what we did in 2020. Obviously, the pandemic was a very unusual year, much deeper than any typical commodity cycle. So, we had to lean harder on that than we normally would. We\u2019re very committed now to making sure that we rebuild that in anticipation of future commodity cycles. I think what we said during the Investor Day was we\u2019re going to shoot for something between 20% and 25% debt to capital. And that still feels like a reasonable place to be, and we\u2019ll work our way towards that as we go through this year and probably into next, obviously, depending upon the price and margin environment that we find ourselves in. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : The first question that we have is on the balance sheet, and we\u2019re just maybe looking for a little update here. Based on what you\u2019re seeing so far on the macro and with your own operations, is there any update to the $45 to $50 breakeven for 2021 to cover CapEx to maintain the dividend? I know Chem\u2019s margins, they\u2019ve dramatically improved; Downstream margins, they\u2019re still kind of below the 10-year band. Darren Woods : Yes. And so, if you remember how we did that breakeven as we made some assumptions about kind of low end of Chemical and Downstream margins and then average Chemical margin and Downstream margins going forward. And recognizing that that wasn\u2019t necessarily forecast, it was just one way to characterize it. And the important point we were trying to make, and I think we\u2019ve made historically, is as you look at our breakeven, you can\u2019t just focus on the crude price that we\u2019ve got significant businesses in both the Downstream and Chemicals that obviously impact that. I would say, we haven\u2019t tried to update that number. I think what we tried to do with the Investor Day is just give you and others the confidence that with our portfolio and the plans that we had, we were robust to a very wide range of prices. The fact that the Chemical margins are as good as they are today says that that breakeven has come down. But frankly, we\u2019re not really sharpening our pencils anymore on that because we\u2019ve got a plan, and the foundations of that plant haven\u2019t changed. I just think we feel better about the position that we\u2019re in today, given where the market is at. We\u2019ll take advantage of it while it\u2019s here. But, I would tell you that our plans aren\u2019t based on those sustaining themselves. And as I said, we will pay down the debt and deleverage faster, given the help that we\u2019re getting from the market right now. That\u2019s just put us in a stronger position for the future. Jeanine Wai : Okay. I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. My second question is on CapEx. So, for the \u201821 budget, Q1 was in line with your plan. You reiterated the $16 billion to $19 billion for the year. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it somewhere, but are you still targeting the lower half of the range, given what you\u2019re seeing on the macro performance? For example, in the Permian, you slightly raised your production guidance only slightly. But, is that based on the same level of activity that you originally forecasted? Are you going faster than expected? We saw in the slide, you cited the performance improvement. But, some of those performance improvements would indicate that you are going faster, so you could be doing more activity. So, just wanted an update on if you\u2019re still thinking about the lower half for the year. Darren Woods : Yes. So, I think the guidance that we gave was $16 billion to $19 billion. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that has not changed. And what I said during the Investor Day is that I expect to be on the lower end of that range, and that expectation remains today. They\u2019re not necessarily targets. We have a plan that the business is executing, and that plan includes a spend level. That spend level has not changed. What we\u2019re seeing in the Permian and the point that I tried to make in the slide in the prepared remarks is what\u2019s changed really is the progress that the improvements that that business is making. And what the chart shows you, I think, is really, really impressive performance stuff that we had talked about. And I believe in reorganizing and better leveraging our technology, better leveraging the competencies of the entire organization in this very important resource that we would see significant improvements with time. I think, I\u2019ve been talking about that now for several years. And what that organization is demonstrating is, indeed, they are making improvements and making them at a faster rate than we had planned. And so, that update with the production is a function of that performance improvement. We have not increased the capital allocation to that business. They\u2019re basically running at their planned spend. And obviously, that is -- that plan is across the full year, and that number will change over the year, based on their plan. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Phil Gresh with JP Morgan. Phil Gresh : My first question is a bit of a follow-up on the capital spending. Obviously, the run rate in the first quarter is very low, and you\u2019re expecting the full year to be towards the lower end of the range, so call it, $16 billion to $17 billion. You have the $20 billion to $25 billion target out there for the long term, which would obviously be still a pretty big step up from, say, $16 billion to $17 billion. So, just more intermediate term, as we think out to, say, 2022, should we think of the spending being more gradual in terms of the ramp back up, in terms of getting to the 20, 25 long term? Just any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. No, I think what\u2019s important -- so we\u2019ve put the plan out, our plan. We\u2019ve got plans through 2025 with specific numbers. We\u2019re not managing the business to ranges. We have plans. And those ranges frankly reflect the recognition that -- this is -- we got a big business, a lot of variables impacting our projects, things are going to move, and we can\u2019t precisely call exactly when things will occur. But, we\u2019ve got a pretty good basis for that, and that\u2019s the plan. And that range that we\u2019re showing reflects what I would say is how all these pieces tend to kind of come together and manifest themselves in any one quarter or a year. And so, that range gives us, I think, right kind of flexibility to make sure that what we\u2019re talking to you about, some of that inherent variability in the plant. So, we\u2019re not kind of wondering which end of that range we\u2019ll be at. We\u2019ve got plans within that range and what I said continues to be the case that we\u2019re focused on delivering on those plans. I think, the way to think about the spending is, recognize we put these plans together and reviewed them initially with the Board in October and finalized them in November and then very quickly came out with the release that talked about that. If you think about the October time frame and where prices were at, reflect on the chart that I showed you, there was uncertainty as to exactly how the future would manifest itself. We knew that recovery would come just based on some of those underlying fundamentals, but really difficult to call. So, our plans basically were more back-end loaded. And so, what you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter is a reflection of the recognition that while things will recover that we may still have some very challenging times here in the first quarter and into the second quarter, so making sure that we were building plans that comprehended that and anticipated that and would be robust to that. And so, that\u2019s kind of how we built and why the numbers that you see in the first quarter are lower than maybe what would be a ratable run rate is because we had anticipated a probably more challenging environment than certainly that we\u2019re seeing today. So, that will ramp up. I think, the other point I\u2019d make, Phil, is just the point I made about our pace projects and the good work that our project organization did and thinking through, given a portfolio of very attractive, high-return projects. And as I said, we tested all those informed by what we are seeing with the pandemic, tested whether or not they were going to generate the returns and bring the value that we had expected, and all of them continue to look attractive. And so, we wanted to make sure that in the short term, we can serve spend to respond to the challenges of the pandemic, but make sure that we didn\u2019t compromise that longer term value. And that was the real challenge of last year and the plans that we laid out reflect that. And so, as you move forward, in the back half of this year and into next year, what you\u2019re seeing is some of those projects resuming activities on those products -- projects and seeing that spend go up. And so, that\u2019s, I think, how I would suggest you think about that is feathering in those projects in a very managed way that our project organization is working very closely with our partners and contractors to make sure that we bring those things back online and get that work going in a very efficient and effective manner. Phil Gresh : Okay. Got it. Thank you. My second question would just be coming back to the Gulf Coast carbon capture opportunity. I\u2019m frequently getting asked for ExxonMobil whether this would be more of just an opportunity to reduce your own GHG commissions, or is it something where it can be a third-party business that\u2019s actually a long-term earnings driver for the Company. So, I\u2019m curious how you would answer that. Darren Woods : I\u2019d say yes. I think that project has opportunities to do both. If you -- and again, what we\u2019ve been talking about for some time, and I think if I go back a year ago, the litmus test with respect to whether or not the Company was focused on managing the risk of climate change and position for an energy transition was whether or not you\u2019re investing in solar and wind. Frankly, I\u2019ve been very encouraged at how quickly that conversation has evolved and the recognition that there remains a significant challenge above and beyond the rule that wind and solar and electric vehicles, which they will play an important role. But above and beyond that, how do you decarbonize some of these very difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and do it in a way that is efficient and the lowest cost to society. And so that\u2019s the work that certainly we\u2019ve been talking about for some time and the work that we\u2019ve been investing in with respect to technologies to bring down the cost of the technologies that we believe will be required to achieve that. That\u2019s the venture that we launched in 2018, our carbon capture venture to start looking at how we could commercialize some of that technology and start looking for opportunities around the world. So, all that was happening with this view of what I would say is a business opportunity to meet an evolving demand of society, which is a reduction in CO2. And the way we\u2019re thinking about that, that\u2019s a new business. That\u2019s a new demand for that society, I think, is a strong desire for. And so, we\u2019re at the early stages of a new business. And what we\u2019ve put out there is the opportunity to leverage the skills that we have, the competencies that we\u2019ve developed over decades the experience that we have in bringing new ventures to market, working with governments and leveraging our own capabilities. And this Houston Ship Channel represents exactly that. And we\u2019d be working with a number of companies and industries there, so collaborating with others, working with the government. And our own facilities would be involved in that. So, I think it\u2019s kind of a mix of all those things that you brought up, Phil. It\u2019s an opportunity to reduce our own emissions, an opportunity for others to contribute at scale and a cost-effective way to reduce their emissions. And then, again, potentially, there is a emerging market for CO2 reduction credits, maybe a way to meet that market demand as well. And so, I think it\u2019s early to take a real sharp pencil and lay all that out, but we think the fundamentals are there. And it just becomes -- comes down to then working with the relevant parties to shape the policies and the frameworks and the constructs of that project to take advantage of that -- of those emerging fundamentals. Stephen Littleton : And Phil, I guess, I\u2019d add. What we\u2019re also seeing is policies being established in other parts of the world where we look at Europe over in Asia Pacific region that are interested in doing similar type of efforts to decarbonize in these hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the industry. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I also have two questions, if that\u2019s okay. Darren Woods : Sure. Doug Leggate : Darren, when you laid out the Analyst Day, I think you talked about -- or Neil had talked about something around 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent of disposal impacts in your five-year plan. I realize you\u2019ve gotten UK away now, but can you just bring us up to date that in this, I guess, stronger oil price environment, whether the pace is picking up and how you see that playing out? Darren Woods : Sure, Doug. Thanks for the question. What I\u2019d say is, we laid that plan out quite some time ago. Neil talked about the work we had been doing in assessing the portfolio and upgrading that portfolio. And obviously, two -- a couple of levers to that. One, one lever is clearly the additional investments in bringing in more profitable lower cost production opportunities and then working on some of the tail items of our portfolio to see if others put a higher value on them, particularly given how rich the new opportunities were for us. And so, that portfolio of opportunities remains. We\u2019ve been out actively marketing a number of those. And as you can imagine, last year really slowed that pace down just because of the number of buyers, and I\u2019d say the range of uncertainty with where the future was going. The way I\u2019d characterize it today is we\u2019re continuing that activity on those assets. And I\u2019d say, the work that we did in 2020 puts us in a really good position this year. We did not compromise the value that we expected to achieve, and that slowed things down. But I think as we go into this year, there\u2019s different view that\u2019s being taken on the future and the horizon and the price environment, which is generating more interest. And so, the way I\u2019d characterize it right now, same set of assets, a lot more interest and discussions happening. And we\u2019ll see if we can find the right buyer and settle on a value that\u2019s kind of a win-win proposition, and that work goes on. And I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll see that accelerate a bit. But, it will be accelerated based on a lot of work that\u2019s already happened and will continue to happen. Doug Leggate : Great. I appreciate that. My follow-up is really more of a kind of philosophical question, Darren. I guess, a year ago, your yield was getting up there. So, very -- you could see uncompetitive level in terms of if you ever wanted to do anything in your equity. It\u2019s obviously a consolidation question. You\u2019ve got a fantastic organic portfolio, and some of your peers are now kind of starting with an investment case, you could argue, meaning growth is off the table for investors for the -- at least on EVs. So, when you rack all that together, I\u2019m just wondering how does Exxon think about participating or not in consolidation, whether it be Permian or whether it be international. Darren Woods : Well, I would say, you point out that we have a very strong organic portfolio. And so, I think that gives us a lot of flexibility where we don\u2019t -- we aren\u2019t in a position where we have to go out and transact and look at acquisitions or mergers. But, I would also tell you that at the end of the day, we\u2019re very focused on maximizing our growth in shareholder value, and so, keeping a kind of a firm eye on the opportunity set. And if things develop, if market conditions drive an opportunity that would be accretive and consistent with the existing portfolio and the capital allocation priorities that we\u2019ve talked about, then that would certainly be an opportunity that we\u2019d look at. I don\u2019t think we take anything off the table when it comes to thinking about the future and how we might leverage our capacities. And then, if we find somebody where we can find some synergies with their capabilities and ours and to take advantage of that and together grow value at a rate faster than we can organically. But, I\u2019ll come back to and finish on the point that I started with is we -- the portfolio we\u2019ve got is pretty attractive. It\u2019s going to -- whatever we do is going to have to compete with that attractive portfolio. We feel real good about that. We\u2019ll keep an eye open, but it\u2019s nice not to be in a position where we have to do something. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question then from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, guys. And Darren, thanks for coming on these calls. I know investors value the transparency. And hopefully, you can keep this up regularly, not just once a year. I guess, my first question is just on the Board changes. Exxon has announced some changes to Board representation. You\u2019re obviously in the middle of a proxy contest going into the shareholder meeting. Can you just talk about, from your perspective, Darren, why you think that the current set of Boards -- the current Board best represents the interest of shareholders and some of the changes that you made and what these changes are able to deliver for the shareholder? Darren Woods : Yes. Well, good morning, Neil. And I\u2019d just start by pointing out, this is the second time this year I\u2019ve been on the call. So, I\u2019ve doubled from your once a year. With respect I think to the Board and how we think about that, the first comment I would make is, since I\u2019ve been in this job, been engaging with shareholders pretty consistently and listening to their perspectives and taking their feedback on. And I think as a result of that, you\u2019ve seen quite a bit of change in terms of how we interface with the shareholders and in fact, with you and your community. So, I think we are responding to the feedback that we get. I would tell you that every decision that the Board has made with new directors, and we\u2019ve brought on six since I came into the chair in 2017, have all been in response to and related to the feedback that we\u2019ve been getting to our shareholders. In terms of the types of competencies and skill sets that they think would benefit our Company and managing for the future. And frankly, that continues to be an ongoing dialogue, and we continue to look for what are the capabilities and skills required to successfully manage a business like ours. If you look at the Board we have today, and how we -- the Board Affairs Committee goes through the processes, I think, first, you got to recognize this is a big business that spans the globe and also spans a number of different industrial sectors, consumer product sectors, very complicated, a lot of challenges across the different countries and across the different businesses. And so, really look to make sure that the folks that we bring into the Board have the perspective and the experience of managing global businesses, complex businesses, ones that span the globe and ones that have the kind of challenges that we see. Obviously, if you look at the industry and our Company over time, technology and the evolution of technology and how that applies to our business has been a really important part of the value creation that we\u2019ve driven over the years and a really important part in terms of the future and how that evolves. And so, technology and understanding of the technology, engineering science is an important part of things that we look for in terms of the skills and capabilities of the investors of our Board members. If you think about the capital intensity of the business and how we are so intimately tied into economic growth in economies around the world and people standards of living, directors have had that experience in managing, I think, is important. And you can see that in some of our directors that have that experience in capital-intensive link closely to economic activity. So, that\u2019s important. And then, I think the third point I would make is understanding of and experience in transitioning businesses. And from our perspective, it\u2019s not necessarily transitioning an energy company. It\u2019s transitioning business with fundamental drivers, how you think about the changes in those fundamental drivers and how you effectively respond to those changes while creating shareholder value. If you look at the folks that we have on the Board, a number of our individuals have really pertinent and relevant experience to managing large corporations successfully through transitions, albeit potentially in different industries. We also look to bring on industry experience that I would tell you has been a capability and competencies that we\u2019ve been working to fill for quite some time. It\u2019s challenging to find someone who has the relevant experience and can relate to all the businesses that we\u2019re in, the scale that we\u2019re in and the global coverage. And I think we were very lucky last year to engage with Wan Zul after he retired in the middle of 2020, and very pleased that he came on the Board and brings some of the experience from Asia, which is obviously a really important region for our Company and the fact that that\u2019s where a lot of the growth is happening. So, that was a big advantage. And then, the final point I\u2019ll make with respect to some of the new directors that we brought on is thinking about a transition with all the uncertainties associated with it and the challenge is how to best allocate your capital in that space and make sure that, one, that you\u2019re moving the business in the direction consistent with some of those broader trends, but doing it in a way that protects shareholder value and generates returns. And so, I think some of the new directors have got some really good -- a really good track record in thinking through and doing that and has been bringing some of that additional perspective to many of our existing directors who also have that capital allocation experience. And so, I think we\u2019ve got a really experienced Board with a lot of complementary skills. And the final point I would make, which is really, really important is the chemistry of the Board, the culture that we have, the willingness for those directors to work collectively, collaboratively to engage, discuss, debate, I think, is absolutely critical. And what we find today is our Board meetings, a lot of discussion, a lot of exploring, debating and all done in a very constructive way, all done focused on driving -- ultimately driving value. And so, it\u2019s, I think, a very healthy Board that respects one another, but is very focused at the same time in driving value. And they\u2019ve been a big part in helping reshape the Company and setting us on the path that we\u2019re on now. Neil Mehta : Thanks so much, Darren. The follow-up question is just on slide 16. As you think about your growth projects, you talked a little bit about Guyana. Can you just flush out more just how big do you see this asset becoming over time? And what are the next big milestones we should be looking out for? And you didn\u2019t mention greenfield LNG projects. As you think about those in the Q, where do those stand in terms of the projects that you\u2019d look to move forward over the next five years? Darren Woods : Sure. I would think with Guyana, with respect to the potential of that resource base, it is -- we\u2019ve talked about 9 billion oil equivalent barrels. I would tell you that is the current estimate and that I would expect it to grow. The recent announcement we made with Uaru-2 confirmed a deeper play. And so, I think additional opportunity or suggestive of an additional opportunity and resources that we haven\u2019t fully quantified yet. So, I think it\u2019s a very rich set of opportunities that we\u2019re going to continue to progress. And I wouldn\u2019t look for a big bang per se. I would look for a continued and steady progression of bringing those opportunities to market. I think, we\u2019ve laid out a plan that\u2019s pretty consistent with that, working very closely with the government and the people of Guyana to continue to progress that resource, and really bring a lot of economic opportunity to the country and the people of Guyana. And I think we\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of that manifest themselves, and will continue to contribute on a ratable basis there. So, I would just say a good, steady drumbeat of improvement as we move through those development and those projects. I think today, we\u2019re talking a potential for 7 to 10 FPSOs, 6 projects online by 2027. So, yes, we feel really good about what we\u2019re finding in Guyana and a very constructive engagement with the government in terms of those developments. With respect to LNG, obviously, gas is going to continue to play a really important role. As economies around the world develop, populations grow, people standards of living grow is all going to require power generation, and gas is going to continue to play an important role, in part because it\u2019s a really good substitute for coal and the fact that it\u2019s got much lower emissions, obviously and lower particulate. It also has the potential with time to basically be used in making hydrogen, and that could play a role going forward as well. So, I think gas is going to continue to be a really important part as societies and economies grow and as we move into lower carbon future. And so, in that context, the LNG opportunities remain an important part of the portfolio. And we continue to work very closely with the governments around progressing discussions on how we continue to build on the portfolio that we have and expand those opportunities, and do it in a way that both benefits the countries and the communities in those countries but at the same time are attractive to us and compete within our portfolio. And so, that work goes on. We\u2019re continuing to have very constructive conversations. And I would expect to see those advance at a pace that\u2019s consistent with those conversations landing at the right frameworks for progressing those projects. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Darren. Congrats on a good quarter. Darren Woods : Thanks, Neil. Stephen Littleton : Okay. Thank you, Darren, for participating. I want to thank the audience for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. We appreciate your interest and the opportunity to highlight our first quarter results. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you. And please be safe. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go ahead, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Williams, our Senior Vice President, overseeing Downstream and Chemical. In a moment, Darren, will make some introductory comments. I will then cover the quarterly financial and operating results, and then Jack and Darren will provide their perspectives on the business. Following those remarks, we will be happy to address any questions. Our comments this morning will reference the slides available on the Investors section of our website. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2 and to the supplemental information at the end of this presentation. I will now turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before Stephen takes us through the second quarter results, let me start by covering the significant developments in the quarter, starting with the extensive engagement that Board and I had with our shareholders in the months leading up to our Annual Meeting. We received some very explicit feedback that we found valuable, and are incorporating in our plans as we move the company forward. In future, the directors, the management committee, and I look forward to continuing the active shareholder engagement, and discussing the good work going on at the company and the progress we are making on all fronts. Since our Annual Meeting, we welcomed our new directors : Greg Goff, Kaisa Hietala, and Andy Karsner, with a number of discussions that included myself, our Lead Director Ken Frazier, other Board members, and senior managers of the company. In June, we began the new members' onboarding process with in-depth reviews of our businesses and key topics, such as our energy outlook and our approach to the energy transition. While the Board has met virtually on a couple of topics since the Annual Meeting, this week was the first in-person regular meeting of the Board. We had very substantive and productive discussions across both the committees and the full Board. They were informed by the extensive shareholder engagements over the past several months. I'm pleased to say, that without exception, our directors are focused on improving the performance of the company, addressing the challenges faced by our industry, and increasing long-term shareholder value. There is very good alignment on the importance of leveraging the diverse experience and skills of the Board, the important role ExxonMobil will have in the transition helping to lead to the development and deployment of critical technologies, advocating for necessary policy, and making strategically and financially accretive investments, the need to improve transparency and engagement with our shareholders, actively listening and more explicitly addressing concerns, and of course, driving total shareholder return in both the short and long run. While there is still much to do, I think we're working from a very strong foundation. ExxonMobil is proud to be a global leader in the industry. As the energy system evolves with society's needs, we look forward to continuing our role as a leader, helping lead society through the transition, leveraging the deep thinking and analytical rigor of our 20,000 scientists and engineers, and the hard work of all of our people. Another important development in the quarter was the addition of Kathy Mikells to our management committee as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Board, the other members of the management committee, and our entire organization, I want to welcome Kathy and express how excited we are to have her on board. She joins us formally next month and brings significant CFO and Investor Relations experience from her time at Diageo, Xerox, United Airlines, and ADT. In addition to the financial functions, Kathy's portfolio will include Corporate Strategic Planning, Investor Relations, and a number of our global business services like IT and procurement. We look forward to the depth of experience and perspective she will bring. While welcoming Kathy, I'd like to also recognize Andy Swiger's retirement, which was also recently announced. I'd like to take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the many contributions Andy has made during his 43 years with the company. He has certainly earned his retirement and we all wish him and his wife Sherry the very best. Also of significance in the quarter was the continuing market recovery, which obviously underpins our results. As you will hear, the organization remains very focused on continuing to leverage the changes we've implemented over the last several years and on delivering the plans we've discussed with you in March. As the margin improves, we've maintained a disciplined approach, doing more with less. We remain focused on delivering industry-leading operating performance, continuing to significantly reduce costs, advancing our portfolio of high-return, advantaged projects, executing value-accretive divestments, and rebuilding the strength of our balance sheet. In addition, as a need for climate solutions beyond wind, solar, and electric vehicles grow, we are working to expand our portfolio of strategically and financially accretive low-carbon solutions investments. While still in the early stages, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. I'll come back to this later in the call. At this time, I'll hand it back to Stephen. Stephen Littleton : Thanks, Darren. I will now walk through developments since the first quarter. Across all three businesses, demand recovery has improved results. In the Upstream, liquids realizations improved significantly versus the first quarter. Production was lower due to seasonal gas demand in Europe and higher scheduled maintenance activity, notably in Canada. We continue to explore and progress development in our advantaged deepwater assets with two discoveries announced in Guyana during the second quarter and a third discovery, Whiptail, announced this week. We also completed final investment decision for the Bacalhau development, offshore Brazil. In the Downstream, global demand improved in line with economic recovery. However, we did see the impact of regional lockdowns, resulting from COVID outbreaks. While there was improved demand for gasoline and diesel, margins continue to be impacted by product oversupply and depressed jet demand, driven by lower international travel. The Chemical business achieved record quarterly earnings with strong reliability and high polyethylene and polypropylene margins, specifically in North America and Europe, due to continued strong demand, tight industry supply, and ongoing shipping constraints. During the quarter, we announced the sale of our global Santoprene business to Celanese for more than $1.1 billion. The transaction includes two manufacturing sites in Pensacola, Florida and Newport, Wales and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Earnings improvements across all businesses resulted in increased cash flow from operations, enabling debt reduction of $2.7 billion in the quarter. Finally, our low-carbon solutions business signed two MOUs to progress large-scale carbon capture and storage projects in Scotland and France. Let's move to Slide 5 for an overview of second quarter results. The table on the left provides a view of second quarter results relative to the prior quarter. Earnings, excluding identified items, were $4.7 billion, an increase of approximately $2 billion versus the first quarter, primarily due to higher prices or margins and strong reliability. There was a $700 million hurt compared to the prior quarter from mark-to-market impacts on open financial derivatives, for which the physical trading strategy had not closed. We expect to realize the full earnings benefit of these trading strategies when they close in the future. Consistent with prior disclosures, planned maintenance activity impacted earnings by about $800 million in the quarter and was partially offset by lower corporate expenses and favorable tax items. On the next slides, I will cover a brief summary of quarterly results for each business. Upstream earnings improved more than $630 million compared to the first quarter. Higher prices increased earnings by about $1 billion, partially offset by mark-to-market impacts of unsettled derivatives. Tighter supply demand balances increased liquids realizations by 12%. Gas realizations also increased, driven primarily by higher European and LNG gas prices. Increased planned maintenance, primarily in Canada and Australia, impacted earnings by $360 million. Next quarter, we expect lower levels of planned maintenance. Other items were a help of $310 million and included favorable asset management and one-time tax items. On the next slide, I will cover a brief summary of Upstream volumes. On average, Upstream volumes decreased by about 200,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day compared to the first quarter. Gas and liquids were both lower in the quarter, with seasonal gas demand reductions, primarily in Europe, lower entitlements due to higher prices, and the planned maintenance activity that I mentioned earlier. These impacts were partially offset by improved reliability, primarily in Canada and the U.S., and recovery from winter storm impacts experienced in the first quarter. Moving to Slide 8, Downstream earnings improved by approximately $160 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, margins improved by nearly $600 million, but were partially offset by the unsettled mark-to-market impacts I mentioned earlier. We had our best ever lubricants quarterly earnings, driven by improved basestock margins. We have also seen demand improve, particularly in North America retail fuels. During the quarter, planned maintenance and turnarounds reduced earnings by $220 million. We optimized the timing of our Downstream maintenance in the first half of 2021, which positions us well for the continuing economic recovery as we move through the year. We also benefited from the absence of the first quarter refinery to terminal conversion provision for our Altona, Australia and Slagen, Norway refineries, which was included in the other factor. Moving to Chemical on Slide 9, Chemical had its best ever quarterly earnings, delivering over $2.3 billion, more than $900 million improvement versus the first quarter. Margins improved by approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting our continued, reliable operations and tight industry supply conditions, particularly in the polyethylene and polypropylene markets in North America and Europe. Planned seasonal maintenance and turnarounds in Europe reduced earnings by $180 million. The next slide summarizes results versus the second quarter of 2020. Compared to the second quarter of last year, earnings increased by $7.7 billion, driven by a total price margin improvement of about $6.7 billion, and increased sales of $810 million. We had $850 million in planned maintenance, as we successfully stretched maintenance intervals out of 2020 into the first half of this year. This positions us well for a continuing economic recovery in the second half of 2021. Structural efficiencies, lower corporate and financing expenses, and favorable tax items delivered additional earnings benefits. Slide 11 provides further details on investing and cost management. Excluding energy and production taxes, cash operating expenses were $18.7 billion during the first half of 2021. In addition to reducing structural costs by $3 billion in 2020, the company has captured over $1 billion in further structural savings in the first half of 2021. The company remains on pace to achieve through 2023 total structural cost reductions of $6 billion relative to 2019. The cost associated with turnarounds, winter storm repairs, and other market and activity based factors were a partial offset. Capital expenditures were $3.8 billion in the second quarter and $6.9 billion year-to-date. Consistent with our plans, we started the year with lower levels of investment to provide flexibility for responding to market conditions. We remain on track with full-year spending on a lower end of our $16 billion to $19 billion range. Investments in the second half of the year are expected to be higher due to the timing of spend for major Upstream and Chemical projects, including Guyana, Brazil, Permian, and chemical performance products. Moving on to the summary of cash flow on Slide 12. Cash flow from operating activities was $9.7 billion in the quarter. Excluding working capital effects, this is up about $2 billion from the first quarter, reflecting continued market improvement and ongoing benefits of our cost reductions. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, total debt was reduced to $60.6 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date reductions to over $7 billion. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion of cash. Turning to Slide 13 for the third quarter outlook, in the Upstream, we expect higher volumes with lower planned maintenance. The sale of the UK Central and Northern North Sea assets is now expected to close by the end of the year, subject to regulatory and third party approvals. In the Downstream, we anticipate demand improvement with continued economic recovery. Lower turnarounds and maintenance are planned for the quarter. In Chemical, we anticipate some easing in the tight supply demand balance as industry downtime improves and additional capacity comes online. We also expect lower turnaround impacts next quarter. Corporate and financing expenses are expected to be about $600 million, and we anticipate further debt reductions if prices and margins remain at current levels. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack. Jack Williams : Thank you, Stephen, and good morning. We're very pleased with the company's performance for the first six months of this year from a number of perspectives, including safety, reliability, earnings, cash flow, and debt reduction. We've also made progress in our efforts to reduce emissions, advance lower carbon solutions, and further advance the depth and quality of our portfolio. I'll spend a few minutes providing some highlights and perspectives on this progress, and let's start with a look at the business environment. Second quarter saw a rapidly recovering environment with significant improvement in all our product markets. Oil and gas prices increased materially since the fourth quarter of last year and we're back within the 10-year range, driven largely by economic recovery as the pandemic-related restrictions were relaxed. Downstream margins moved close to the low end of the 10-year band. They continue to be impacted by an unbalanced global refining system, resulting primarily from an oversupply of distillates from low international jet demand. Nonetheless, U.S. demand growth drove substantial improvements from the historic lows of the fourth quarter. Importantly, significant earnings potential remains as the Downstream continues to recover from the lingering effects of the pandemic. And to build on that point and demonstrate just how quickly things can change, Chemical prices and margins were far above the 10-year band and drove record earnings. Chemical's record results were driven by strong base reliability, robust demand, and tight supply for both polyethylene and polypropylene in the North American and European markets. Looking ahead, although we anticipate lengthening of supply and rising feed across the regions, our outlook is for Chemical margins to remain strong in the coming months. Given the dynamic market and record results, I'd like to spend a few minutes talking more deeply about the Chemical markets and our business. Starting with a closer look at the current market environment, the last 18 months have been a testament to the underlying resiliency in demand for chemical products, and that is especially true in a surging global economic recovery, as these products are widely needed for food packaging, hygiene, and the recovering automobile sector among others. This year, polyethylene and polypropylene margins across North America and Europe increased by more than 140% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The recovery in Asia has been more challenging due to pockets of COVID resurgence, higher supply, and increased crude and naphtha prices. The strong margins in the Atlantic Basin are the result of several factors, first, hurricane impacts in late 2020, followed by winter storm Uri earlier this year, which reduced inventory levels; second, unplanned industry shutdowns and turnarounds; third, global shipping constraints of finished products caused by port congestion, container availability, and increased shipping costs from Asia to the U.S.; and then finally, demand growth in the U.S. commensurate with growth in GDP. Our Chemical business has benefited from this tightness, with 70% of our polyethylene capacity located in these regions. A material portion of this is typically exported to Asia, but was redirected to Europe and North America, enabling us to capture more than our share of demand growth. The scale, global footprint, and multitude of product lines in our Chemical business provides competitive advantage and strong earnings potential, as amplified in tight markets like today, and is also durable when looking at longer time frames. ExxonMobil Chemical's earnings over the past decade were 80% higher than the industry average. In the first quarter, our earnings were double the industry average and our second quarter result is materially higher than the first. The core strategy of our Chemicals business is growing technology-driven, higher -value performance products. These have proven over the test of time to add significant value for our customers versus commodity chemical products. Our diverse product offerings and global reach are significant advantages. ExxonMobil Chemical is number one or number two in more than 80% of the markets where we compete. This provides resiliency across a wide range of market scenarios and upside in the market like today. In addition to the product diversity, I want to highlight the benefits we've seen this year from three important drivers. First, our ability to optimize feed and unit operations at our integrated facilities and leverage regional feedstock supply chains has generated about $1.4 billion of earnings for the first six months of this year. Second, as we discussed during Investor Day, we've sharpened our focus on making our Chemicals business a leader in cost efficiency. As a result, costs were down significantly in 2020 and even with the higher sales volumes this year, ongoing structural efficiencies, such as digital enhancements, manufacturing efficiencies, and previously announced staffing reductions are expected to support $1 billion in annual reductions versus 2019. And third, the recent advantaged project investments, including the world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast steam cracker and polyethylene reactors delivered $600 million in earnings in the first half of this year. And there are more advantaged projects in flight today that will grow our supply of performance products and have an even larger impact on earnings. These projects will grow our supply of performance products by 70% by 2027 and grow the earnings contribution by 100% due to the higher-value slate of new products. These products bring significant benefits to our customers. They support lower emissions, improve the performance of technologies that enable the energy transition, and improve efficiencies. And those advantages ultimately are reflected in higher margins. For example, polyethylene packaging has lower lifecycle emissions compared to alternatives. Performance polyethylene like our Exceed XP is stronger, enabling thinner films for the same applications. We're developing the capability to produce certified circular polymers from plastic waste using our proprietary advanced recycling technology and polypropylene used to reduce the way the vehicles improve fuel economy and battery life. The projects gain advantage not just from the higher margin products they produce, but also from advantaged feed, scale, proprietary catalyst technology, and the integration with our existing chemical and downstream facilities and logistics. Our focus going forward remains on advancing a number of major chemical and also downstream projects that will further strengthen our integrated manufacturing platforms and upgrade our product mix to meet a range of future demand scenarios. As you may recall, many of these projects were paced to preserve cash during the market downturn last year. Our Global Projects organization has done an excellent job managing this activity to preserve long-term value. This group of projects are expected to still be completed within the FID estimate. As an aside, this is the same organization that will be delivering future carbon capture projects, advancing through our Low Carbon Solutions business. This capability continues to be an enduring competitive advantage and will only increase in importance going forward. In the Chemical business, our large Corpus Christi chemical complex is ahead of schedule and under budget. We just announced a mechanical completion of the three derivative units, including a monoethylene glycol unit and two polyethylene reactors. Full site start-up is anticipated by year-end. Progress is ongoing at the polypropylene growth project in Baton Rouge, with start-up anticipated next year. Our Baytown chemical plant expansion will include a new Vistamaxx unit and a full range, linear alpha olefins unit. It's on track for a 2023 start-up. Our China1 venture captures the advantage of being located in the world's largest growth market. We signed several important agreements to advance the project, including a contract with Sinopec for basic engineering design, procurement, and construction. In the Downstream, we're moving crude to the Wink to Webster pipeline from the Permian Basin and are preparing to ship third party production in the fourth quarter of this year. At Beaumont, process unit modules are on-site and we're ramping up construction activity for start-up in 2023. And our Singapore and Fawley projects are also progressing. However, they are a bit further out in terms of full project restart. Even in the current challenging refining environment, these Downstream projects are still attractive and materially improve the competitiveness of our integrated sites. If these four projects were online at today's margins, they would be contributing more than $1 billion in annual earnings. For example, our Singapore resid project will produce 20,000 barrels a day of high quality lube basestocks that would have added to our strong lubricants result this quarter. Collectively, this world-class Chemical and Downstream project portfolio delivers 30% returns at 10-year average margins. That's more than $4 billion of annual earnings at 10-year average margins and $2 billion at 10-year low margins. We're also benefiting from ongoing attractive Upstream investments as well, especially in the Permian as development performance continues to improve, resulting in rapidly growing value. We produced 4,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day this quarter, which was up approximately 50,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day versus the second quarter of last year, excluding the impact of the economic curtailments. We expect to grow production a further 40,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day in the third quarter. And importantly, value is growing even faster as operating and development performance continues to improve at a rate exceeding our plans. Relative to 2019, we've more than double the lateral feet we're drilling per day and recently set an industry record by drilling the Delaware Basin 12,500 foot lateral in just 12 days. At the end of the second quarter, our drilling rates are approximately three times more efficient than in 2019. Another way to think about this is that the eight rigs we're running today are achieving the same lateral length as it took close to 25 rigs to drill just two years ago. Completions are improving too. Our frac rates are around 50% faster. This has resulted in a reduction in drilling and completion costs of more than 40%. And on top of that, we've also improved lease operating expense by about 35%. Our environmental performance also continues to improve. We achieved record-low flaring intensity levels during the quarter, which was top quartile in the industry. As we've discussed previously, the advantage short cycle development profile of the Permian gives us flexibility within the portfolio. The parameters setting our pace of development have not changed. First, delivering positive free cash flow across a broad range of price scenarios; second, demonstrating we are achieving industry leading capital efficiency; and third, ensuring double-digit returns at $35 a barrel or less. This low price resiliency also applies to our deepwater developments in Guyana and Brazil. In Guyana Stabroek block, we've added three new discoveries since the first quarter, including the Whiptail discovery announced this week. The Uaru-2 well encountered 220 feet of high quality oil bearing reservoirs. The Longtail-3 well encountered 230 feet of net pay, and both of these results included newly identified intervals below the zones originally discovered. Resource quantification is ongoing. The Whiptail-1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay and drilling is ongoing at the Whiptail-2 well, which has encountered 167 feet of net pay, both in high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. This additional resource will add to the 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels we discussed at Investor Day, further increasing our confidence in the resource size and quality in the area east of Liza and supporting our view of an ultimate block-wide footprint of seven to 10 developments. The projects in progress remain on schedule, with the expected arrival of the Liza Phase 2 Unity FPSO in Guyanese waters early in the fourth quarter. Payara, the third major development on the block is on track for a 2024 start-up, with topsides construction ongoing. And pending government approval, we're targeting a final investment decision on Yellowtail, our fourth major development later this year, with start-up planned for 2025. Offshore Brazil, we confirmed the final investment decision on the Bacalhau development during the second quarter and expect this 220,000 barrel a day project to start up in 2024. It will deliver more than a 15% rate of return at $50 a barrel. I'll now turn the call back over to Darren to discuss our Low Carbon Solutions business and long-term plans. Darren Woods : Thanks, Jack. Let me shift focus now to the wide range of activities we are pursuing to ensure ExxonMobil plays a key role in the energy transition, while continuing to grow shareholder value. You will recall that earlier this year, we established our Low Carbon Solutions business to develop potential carbon capture and storage opportunities, using both established and emerging technologies and progress commercialization of other lower-emissions technologies. We believe that the depth and breadth of our operating experience, history of process innovation, project execution, subsurface expertise, and ability to scale technology gives us a competitive advantage in what is expected to be a fast-growing market for Low Carbon Solutions. We also believe that the time is right, given the developing market for emission reduction credits and growing recognition of the importance of carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels by both governments and investors, all critical for broad-scale commercialization. The new organization is making steady progress in developing a wide range of attractive opportunities weighted initially towards carbon capture and storage. We've provided a few examples here to give you a sense of the opportunities. Next year, we anticipate final investment decisions for a large CCS expansion at our LaBarge facility in Wyoming and a new carbon capture technology pilot associated with the Porthos project in Rotterdam. This quarter, we signed an MOU to explore the development of CO2 infrastructure to help decarbonize the industrial basin in the Normandy region of France, and an MOU to participate in the recently announced Acorn CCS project in Scotland. We are continuing to pursue several Gulf Coast opportunities, including our Houston hub concept, which are all gaining industry and third-party support. In addition to carbon capture and storage, we're advancing a number of options to produce low-emissions biofuels. These include new projects, repurposing existing refinery units, co-processing bio feeds and purchase agreements. These plans would enable the production of more than 40,000 barrels per day of low-emission fuels by 2025. We also recently completed a successful trial to co-process bio feed across our existing refining circuit. Co-processing bio feeds is a key technology that can be rapidly scaled to help society quickly lower emissions, provided the right policies are in place. In addition, during the quarter, we expanded a previous agreement with alternative fuels developer, Global Clean Energy, to annually purchase up to 5 million barrels of renewable diesel. This is basically a drop in lower carbon fuel that meets all finished product specs for today's engines. Commercial production is expected to begin next year. In markets where low carbon fuels policies incentivize the development of lower-emission fuels, like California and Canada, scale opportunities exist. We see the potential to leverage our existing facility footprint, proprietary catalyst technology, and decades of experience in processing challenging feed streams to develop attractive low-emission fuels projects with competitive returns. An effectively designed low carbon fuel standard in the U.S. could accelerate significant CO2 reductions in the hard-to-abate transportation segment at a cost much lower than some existing policy. While we advocate for new policies, such as a carbon tax or low carbon fuel standard and develop future projects, we continue to lead the industry in developing and deploying new technologies to address another important issue, reducing methane emissions. To that end, we have conducted more than 23,000 leak surveys on more than 5 million components at over 9,500 locations. We are eliminating high-bleed pneumatic devices across our U.S. unconventional production, and participating as a founding member in industry initiatives to improve detection and reduction of methane leaks. ExxonMobil is also the first company to file an application with the EPA to use airplanes equipped with methane detection technology to conduct large flyover inspections, and we're evaluating satellite technology in support of our 2025 reduction plans for both methane intensity and absolute methane emissions. These ongoing efforts to commercialize Low Carbon Solutions and reduce emissions are central to our long-term plan to grow shareholder value. As markets and policies continue to evolve, we will be there playing our part, contributing where we bring the most value. In the near term, as we begin the development of next year's plan, our organization is focused on continuing to deliver industry-leading operating performance, building on last year's record results in safety and reliability, and extending our trend of annual reductions in emissions intensity by accelerating the pace of reductions and establishing more aggressive objectives. This will enable us to reduce our own emissions at a pace faster than what the countries have committed to under the Paris Agreement. It will also help accelerate our objective of industry leadership in greenhouse gas performance by the end of the decade. Of course, we remain focused on sustained financial discipline. We are developing plans consistent with our existing commitments to deliver $6 billion of annual structural savings by the end of 2023, manage future capital investments, including new low carbon projects within previously announced CapEx ranges, and restoring the strength of our balance sheet, returning debt to levels consistent with a strong AA rating. As our results demonstrate, we've made good progress in improving our competitiveness, but we're not satisfied. Our plans will focus on driving a further step change. We see a significant opportunity to capture scale and integration benefits from our recent reorganizations, improving efficiency, effectiveness, and growing additional cash flow. To strengthen the earnings and cash flow potential of our assets, our plans will continue to advance high-return, advantaged projects and high-grade our existing assets through accretive divestments. Finally, as I have illustrated, we're stepping up and accelerating efforts to ensure the company plays a meaningful role in the energy transition. Our plans will reflect the continuing development and deployment of needed technologies, and where the appropriate incentives are in place, accretive investments. As we finalize our plans later this year, we'll provide additional updates with a more detailed review at our next Investor Day. Reflecting back on the past half year, we're pleased with the results the organization's hard work has delivered in a recovering market. We've made a lot of progress, as demonstrated by our year-to-date performance, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. We appreciate your participation in today's call. I look forward to answering your questions. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Darren. Operator, please open up the phone lines. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Woods, Mr. Williams, and Mr. Littleton. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning, Darren. Darren Woods : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gresh : So just going back to your earlier remarks about all the discussions that you've had with the Board recently, I'm curious what you take away from that as to whether you have any new or incremental thoughts about the best way to drive increased value to shareholders from here. You kind of went through some items there at the very end, but on the margin, do you feel like you've learned anything different from these discussions? And if you could layer in some thoughts around CapEx and balance sheet in that, that'd be helpful? Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. Yes, thanks, Phil. Good to hear from you this morning. Yes, I think the one point I would make in terms of the context to the response is it's fairly early in the process, as I said in my opening comments. We've only had the one meeting with the Board, but I would tell you that meeting was very encouraging. The other point I would make is, actually, the new Board has formed at a very good time with respect to our typical cycle with to - and managing the business. We have just kicked off our corporate plan process that runs through the end of November. And so we, with the new Board, went through the basis of the plan and the objectives that we are setting ourselves. We had an opportunity for a very rich conversation about that and what we need the organization to deliver this year and continuing this year and into next year and the years ahead. We also have a bi-annual strategy process that we have in place, which this year, we are doing in September and the new Board will basically have an opportunity to really dig into and go through the strategies that we've developed with all of our business, including our new business, low-carbon solutions and the broader corporate profile. So I expect as we go through this year to get a lot of good conversations about where the company is going, the opportunities that are ahead of us, and where we want to put our emphasis. I think I would say the fundamental approach that we have taken is very, I'd say, is a pretty good alignment amongst the Board. I think they all recognize that the opportunity for us to take a leadership role in this space and just leveraging the capabilities and advantages we currently have. And so, finding the opportunities that fit well with where we can add the most value is, I think, a very aligned objective amongst the Board, and of course you've heard me talk about that, I mentioned in my opening comments. The broader conversation network this society is now having, governments are now having around the solution sets needed to address the transition, I think, opens the door to a much richer conversation about where ExxonMobil can play and contribute carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, biofuels, other areas potentially where that leverage our strength. So I think we're - the things are lining up very well within the company, and then I would say more externally in the broader environment. With respect to CapEx in the balance sheet, as you mentioned, I think, again, good alignment around the importance of rebuilding the strength of the balance sheet. Everyone recognizes this is a commodity market with some significant cycles and volatility, and making sure that we've got a balance sheet that we can lean on as we move through that volatile environment and manage the downs, as well as the ups, is a really important foundational piece of our strategy, and I think very good alignment on that. And that was reaffirmed in the conversations we had this week with our finance committee and the broader Board. And I think, too, given the improvements we've made around capital efficiencies, the work our global project organization has done to really make sure that we can deliver these projects with - at a very advantaged cost. We're very confident that we can do the things that we want to do, add some additional activities in the low-carbon solutions, and do all of that within the range of CapEx that we've previously communicated. And I think, again, good alignment on that and we will confirm that as we move to plan cycle and have those reviews with the Board later this year. Phil Gresh : Got it. Okay. And as a follow-up, just on the spending side and with respect to your comments, it sounds like, if you were to stick with the $20 billion to $25 billion range, which would be up a decent amount from the low end of the $16 billion to $19 billion range this year. Should we be seeing more of an acceleration around energy transition spending kind of embedded in that? Is that how you envision things moving forward versus how you thought about in the past? Darren Woods : Yes, I would say that the energy transition spending will be embedded in the range that we've laid out. I think though, it's good to keep some perspective in this space. If you think about the comments around the broader opportunity set opening up and a broader recognition of the need for that opportunity sets, I'm referring to carbon capture, hydrogen, that's a very rapidly evolving space. And so, while we've got a really, I think, good portfolio of opportunities, some of them very attractive that the time to transition from the planning and the development of those projects to steel in the ground is going to take some time, we'll be talking about that and the investments that we're planning going forward. And then, of course, the steel in the ground will come with time across the horizon that we typically talk about. And all of that's expected to be within the 20 to 25 range. Phil Gresh : Got it. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet, Phil. Operator : We'll go next to Jon Rigby with UBS. Jon Rigby : Thank you. Yes. Can I ask a question on the Downstream? I listened to what Jack said about the Chemicals and the huge competitive advantage Exxon continues to demonstrate in Chemical. If you could turnaround that comment and sort of see it in reverse in the Downstream, where the series of loss-making quarters is pretty unusual and looks like underperformance versus your peers. Are there any takeaways from those quarters that you could share with us around sort of the structural makeup of that business, or are you just relying on the cycle for those earnings and cash flows to recover? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Jon, and good morning. I'll - I'm going to hand it to Jack here to get maybe more specifics, maybe a couple of broader comments that you point, that it is unusual given the consecutive quarters of challenged results in the Downstream. But I would also say, going through the pandemic and losing over half of the jet demand, coming out of the refining circuit is very unusual as well. And I think a very discrete and unique event associated with the global pandemic. So I think that context is really important to keep in mind as you think about our Downstream business and the results. The other point that I would just make with respect to your comment or question is, I think, when you talk about the Downstream and compare across competitors, you've got to recognize the difference in the footprints and the investments in capital assets that we have. I would tell you, as you look across our competitive group, we are much more heavily weighted in refining than some of our competitors. And so, obviously, in an environment where refining margins are structurally down, performance is going to look different. And I think it's really important and certainly to what we focus on is making sure we normalize and understand what aspects are driving the performance. And I would say, our capital structure, the investments that we've made over the years are a really important part of that.  I'd also tell you that what I refer to as the physics of this business is, and you can't stay at these low levels and continue with the level of supply that has historically existed in the Downstream, and you see that today with the shutdowns that are incurring in the industry. And so, while that takes some time, this market will come back into balance and if it's anything like we've seen in the crude, when that economic recovery kicks in, we're going to see supply and demand tighten, I suspect, and I think we'll see a different level of performance with respect to the Downstream and with respect to our peers. But obviously, that will be a function of that balance and when that economic recovery comes back around again. And I'll just make one final point in terms of - we are not relying on just the cycle, we recognize the impact of the cycle, but I can assure you that that Downstream organization is very focused on ensuring that we're pulling as many of value levers as we can in the right way to build sustained and structural improvements that will benefit us obviously in this down cycle, but also in the up cycle. Well, with that, let me turn it over to Jack. I don't know if I left anything, Jack. Jack Williams : Well, I did want to pick up on the refining exposure versus some of the others. We do have a - as the largest refiner, I would say refiner, we do have quite a bit exposure to that market. And we talked about in the fourth quarter how historical low that was, and we are seeing some recovery. But due to the jet demand, that's going to take a little bit of time. I did mention in my prepared remarks that these new investments that we are making will help, and the recent ones we have made have helped. The Rotterdam investment has made a couple hundred million dollars this year, and that will continue to help. So we are investing to continue to grow advantage in our - in what is a, difficult right now, fuels value chain. But picking up on the Rotterdam comment, our lubricants business has done quite well over the past couple of years. As a matter of fact, having a record year last year and extremely strong results so far this year. So that is a kind of balance to the fuels, a tough refining fuels market. We - I mentioned the integration of our refining with our chemicals. 75% of our refineries are integrated with chemicals and others are in advantaged market. So we're making sure - we want to make sure that refineries we have going forward are advantaged, and that's what these investments are about, making sure the ones that we think are - have natural advantages, we build on those advantages. And then just in terms of Darren's comment about kind of the physics of refining, we see about almost 3 million barrels a day rationalization over the past year, 18 months. So it's definitely quite a bit above where it has been historically, and we'll just have to see how that plays out, but we are seeing a slow - slower than we hoped recovery refining environment. Jon Rigby : And just a follow-up. Darren, you mentioned at the start - you sort of referenced some of the responsibilities that Kathryn will be taking on when she takes on the role of the CFO, and I think you indicated IR responsibilities, strategic planning, et cetera. But it is unusual, very unusual to appoint somebody from outside of the organization at such a senior role and also somebody without oil and gas experience. So I just wondered whether you could just expand a little bit around the sort of qualities and experience that she brings that will add value, or will add to the process at the high level of Exxon. Darren Woods : Sure. And then maybe, just as, I think, very important context to understand what's enabled that change or evolution. And I've talked before, I think, with all of you about the reorganizations and the consolidations and the changes that we've been making in how we run the business. If you look at the senior, the corporate officers in the organization, we've reduced that group by almost 40% over the years in terms of - as we simplify the business, line up the value chains, reduce the overhead, and we were able to make significant simplifications in that structure and then reduce numbers. And that also allows us to concentrate consolidate some of the responsibility. So as we've made those changes with time, we've been able to shape the portfolio of the management committee members and focus them on core areas. And so, we're in a position today where as we've consolidated those responsibilities and focus them, that we're creating a management committee position that's much more aligned today with what would be typical CFO type responsibilities versus in the past where we had much broader number of businesses and therefore, a much broader reporting relationship up into Dallas. So that simplification has enabled our ability to focus and bring these portfolios in line with what would be some more industry standard opportunities, which then led us, and through Board discussions last year, to start thinking about how we can expand the capabilities, the skill sets, the experience on the management committee, and bring in what we think is some relevant experience into a portfolio that's consistent with and shaped with outside industry experience, and the - obviously understanding the industry is going to be an important role with that. I think we've got a pretty capable team and organization that understands that industry very well. It's going to support Kathy with respect to that, as she comes up the learning curve there. But I also think she will bring in a lot of perspective from the outside that's very relevant to the business, along some of those core areas, including procurement and supply chains, and some the other areas of responsibility. So I think there is - that change in our structure and approach to running the business has opened up some nice opportunities and we think bringing in that diversity of thought, experience, and perspective is actually going to benefit, and obviously we'll supplement that with our industry knowledge. I think the mix will be a very powerful combination. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Darren, I'm going to try and ask this as eloquently as I can, if you can bear with me for a minute, to address the 800-pound gorilla in the room, which obviously was the Board changings. The press would have us believe that you lost a climate fight. But all the discussions that we've had with some of your large shareholders suggest it was an issue of capital discipline, spending, dividend protection. And my question really is that Exxon is already a leader in carbon capture. You're already leading through the methane partnership. You've been doing a lot of things for a long time, and you have got one of the best portfolios of growth opportunities in the industry that can drive sustainable dividend growth. A lot of your peers mismanaged the cycle. Now, where some might say you spend a little bit too aggressively, the bottom line is, you've still got those opportunities. So can you give us some assurances that just to tick a box, you're not going to sacrifice returns relative - on a relative basis across the portfolio? Darren Woods : I think that's an easy answer to give you, Doug. That has been a primary focus for us for a long, long time, it's certainly when I've been in the job. And as you know from past conversations, the work that we've been doing to reshape the organization, to get more effective at running the business, and then importantly, recapitalizing the business with advantaged assets and supply has been a really important focus, and I think the work that we've done in the past has put us in a very solid position to continue to contribute. I think everybody on the Board is realistic with respect to the challenges facing society with this transition and the work that's going to be required by everybody, ourselves, the rest of industry, governments around the world, other industries, and consumers to make changes on that transition and that will take time. And I think as you look at a lot of the independent third-parties' assessments, they all recognize that this is a challenging area that's going to require a lot of work and expertise in that our industry has an important role to play in helping with that transition, but very importantly, and continuing to meet the need for energy and existing sources of energy. And so, that's the balance that we're trying to strike. And of course, I think one of the - and how that transition evolves and the uncertainty associated with it, obviously everyone could take a different view on that. Our view is the way you help manage some of that uncertainty while you're continuing to meet current demand is to make sure that what you're doing is very advantaged, and on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, which is what we've been focused on, what we've been talking about. So, we think we've got a really good portfolio of high-return projects that are advantaged versus the rest of industry. And so, as time goes on and that uncertainty begins to manifest itself, we think irrespective of how that - the shape of that curve, we're still going to be in a very good position. And so, I think strong recognition within the Board that's the advantage that we've created, and I think commitment to continue to leverage that advantage as we look at opportunities in this space of transition. And the final point I would make to try to reassure you, Doug, is, I think, one of the - if you go back 18 months, I would say, the litmus test for whether or not somebody was committed to helping manage the transition was whether we are investing in solar and wind. Of course, we were concerned about the returns you can generate in that and the value that we bring to that sector. My sense is, over the last 18 months, the broader conversation has quickly evolved and there is this recognition today that more solutions are needed and solutions that fit into our skill set and solutions where we have been working on creating advantage. So, I'm confident that as the need for carbon capture is recognized and projects are being advanced in that space, for biofuels or hydrogen, that the work that we've done and the technology and the fundamentals of carving out advantage there, that we will generate a above industry, above average return for the things that we do in that space. Doug Leggate : Go ahead. Jack Williams : I would just add to that real quick. If you think about the projects that I talked about, the Chemical and Downstream projects, the Permian and Guyana, very, very good strong returns, industry leading returns from that portfolio. I feel as good about that portfolio as I've ever felt in terms of the projects - project returns we have, Doug. So, I think we're pursuing high returns. Doug Leggate : Yes, Thank you for the full answer, guys. My follow-up actually, Jack, is for you and hopefully, it's a quick one after that full answer. It really is a follow-up on the Downstream comment earlier, one of the questions about consecutive quarters of weakness, but I would also - my question, I guess, is Chemicals is hitting on all cylinders, and I understand your business after over 25 years, Jack. It's been about optimizing between those two. So to the extent you can, can you characterize to what extent decisions made to maximize Chemical's profitability may be detrimental in your system to refining? Should we look at the two businesses together? And I guess that - what I'm really trying to get at is coming out of this recovery, when would you see the investments in refining specific start to show up as improved returns. Jack Williams : Yes. Doug, I think you're getting at the value of the integrated sites and the tight integration between our Chemicals and Downstream organizations, which is absolutely valuable and we can look at those integrated sites and find several hundred million dollars a quarter of value-add, real bottom line value-add with all of these streams moving back and forth. And what we're doing, I think, an even better job of in recent years is looking at the whole portfolio together. And for instance, the Singapore project is a both a Downstream and Chemicals project and you'll see more of those, I think, where we're involving both sides of the business and creating additional value there. So, I think that integration, we view is a real strength going forward, as you think about the whole energy transition and to move forward there, I think it's going to be even more valuable, as we think about molecule management and increase in the value of all those molecules coming into our integrated complexes. Darren Woods : I think, the other point I'd add, Doug is, you're right about is a little artificial to split between refining and chemical, because you've got molecules flowing back and forth, and the only other point I would add to what Jack said was if you think in the area of recycling plastic and some of the work we've been doing for advanced recycling, we're actually using our refinery footprint to recycle plastic into the Chemical business. And so, it is somewhat arbitrary. We try to make sure we understand the drivers behind each of those, but where you choose to draw the line, obviously, is an internal choice, and we're not thinking about it so much along those lines, it's really around how do you maximize the value at the whole. Operator : We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : A couple of operating questions for me. There is a pretty clear inflection in Upstream U.S. earnings even compared to sort of the last cycle, right, when oil prices may have been very strong, but Upstream had a lot of capital employed and there was differentials. Now, all that seems to be out and Upstream net income in the U.S. is better than it's been in a long time. So I wonder if that's on plan. It seems like it is, because you invested a lot in infrastructure to enhance that, but just if that's altering any of your conceptions of sort of capital allocation and CapEx tilting here, particularly with respect to the Permian. Jack Williams : Yes, let me, - I'll answer that one, Sam. I think when you're talking about U.S., you talking about the Permian. That's what - from the Upstream perspective, that's what's going to be driving our results there. And I think the slide I showed pretty much demonstrated why that - - you're seeing that bottom line earnings improvement. We're really improving the development efficiency in the Permian, really hitting on all cylinders, getting the sort of efficiencies that we've been targeting for last couple of years, and really hitting those three priorities we talked about, in terms of increasing cash flow and capital efficiency, and really driving those development costs. So as we look going forward in the Permian, we're going to be looking at making sure we hold on to those efficiencies that we've captured, making sure that we - those we sustainable, and then continue to work the technology there, and we see some additional benefits of technology being applied to that program. And as we do that, you get confidence that those benefits are sustainable, we've got the technology built in and we'll be growing that program over time. Darren Woods : Yes, I'd add, Sam, that we are actually ahead of our plan with respect to the improvements and the work that we did early on with the delineation, the infrastructure we put aboveground, all of that, spending at the front end to position ourselves as we move forward. And if you recall, the talk we had about technology and what we wanted to do there, that's all coming to fruition. And then, I think as we move forward, it's how we make sure we're continuing to leverage that effectively, and that's an ongoing area of focus and discussion because we see good value there, good opportunities, but we're going to make sure that we hang on to the gains and continue to leverage that effectively. Jack Williams : So, we have the first train of the large infrastructure plant we have up in Poker Lake is full, and we have that connected to our Wink terminal, and our Wink terminal connected all the way into the Gulf Coast. So we have set up that infrastructure now and it's starting to click in terms of bottom line performance. Sam Margolin : Thanks. And then just a follow-up on asset sales, you're paying down debt organically at a pretty healthy pace here. Asset sales were important in prior calls, because they were built into your production outlook too, and it created sort of a flat production outlook, even though you are reinvesting a lot in new assets. I wonder if asset sales are still something that is important to the program, or if we should think about kind of net production growth with a lower emphasis on asset sales over the next four years? Darren Woods : Yes. Sam, I'd tell you that the emphasis has not changed and I think the way you've characterize it isn't exactly how we were thinking about. Our drive for divestments and asset sales is really around focusing on concentrating our assets in the areas where we have advantage, where we can leverage some of our organizational capabilities, and so it's really around focusing the portfolio and highgrading it, and that continues to be a really important part of our work there. And so, that whole divestment discussion that we've had in the past continues to hold. You'll recall, last year we said, given the market dynamics and the impact of the pandemic that that was probably going to slow the pace of those. It certainly didn't slow our activities, and I would tell you today, our activities haven't slowed, and what we're seeing now with additional buyer interest, my expectation is, as we move forward, if we can find deal space there, we'll continue to continue to see those things play themselves out. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Coming back to some of the opening comments you had, Darren, and some of the questions you've got on here, as we think about new Board, strategies that you've had, maybe some changes, do you think we wait until next March at the Investor Day for any sort of new unveiling of what a different Board could provide, or do you think from what you've seen so far, most of what we've heard makes sense right, get the balance sheet fixed, you've already made a lot of changes on the CapEx front, you do have a tremendous backlog of projects across the Upstream and the Chemicals and Downstream, which you've highlighted here, or do you think that we're in kind of a stasis and we simply have to wait six months to find out anything you run different? Darren Woods : No, I would say - I think, actually, we started a different approach last year that was maybe overwhelmed or mixed up with some of proxy action that was going on, but we had committed last year to start a more of a continuum and discussions and talking and put less emphasis on the Investor Day big bang and more, what I would say is, continuing dialog about where the business is going. And so, after we had our plan endorsed by the Board, we put out a press release that gave some highlights. I talked about it in our fourth quarter call and then rolled into the Investor Day. I would tell you that continues to be the new approach that we want to take. I think that was reinforced by a lot of the discussions that we had with shareholders and this desire for continued transparency and more engaged dialogues. And so, we're committed to continuing to do that. My expectation was, as the Board goes through its deliberations, as our organization develop plans and options, that you're going to see a more of a continuum in the discussion and the evolution of those plans going forward. I think again, I'd just reiterate, if you look at the foundational elements of our strategy, which is really leveraging the strengths of our corporation, the technology, the ability to scale, our projects organization, the capital capabilities that we have, a lot of those fundamentals, those have not changed. And the work that we are doing in technology to advance as what we believe are going to be important solutions to adjust to address transition - the transition, that hasn't changed. In fact, what I would tell you is, there's probably even more appetite around that. So if you think about the fundamentals, what we can bring to the equation, and then what's needed, given that those remain fairly constant, I think, I wouldn't see huge shifts in the strategy, but you may see accelerations, additional emphasis in areas, and continuing to leverage on those cores and how they manifest themselves. We're committed to leveraging the new perspectives and experience and capabilities we've brought into the Board. That was part - in part, some of the reasons that we made some of those changes. And so, we've got a really good experience set today, and how we leverage that in our thinking and what opportunities that develops, I think we'll come out of our strategy and plan discussions and we'll talk to you all about that as that thinking evolves and gets translated into plans and actions. Roger Read : That is great, thanks. Glad it won't be months of wondering what's next. Second question I had for you, looking at the Upstream performance this quarter, which actually was pretty good and then dovetailing that with the expectation for the additional $3 billion of OpEx savings, which I recognize is spread across the company, but if we look at your peer that reported today, they returned about the same amount of net income on a lower production volume number. And I know at any quarter, there is moving parts and doing an exact comparison is a little bit unfair, but it is a meaningful number of equality across two different companies. And I was wondering as you think about the OpEx savings to come, that $3 billion, and the Q2 performance, kind of where you think you are today and where you think you might be by the end of 2023 when all that's run through, as we think about profitability of the Upstream? Darren Woods : Well, I would - I guess, a couple of thoughts with respect to that - to your question, Roger. First of all, I'd link back to the comment that we had in the Downstream, not all volumes are created equal. And so, when you talk about Upstream and volumes, I think you really got to step back and look at the mix of those volumes and the resource types that you're in and the location of the resources. And so, I think again, while it ultimately is a function of what you deliver and so, no excuses there, it's just understanding that and what leverage you have to affect it, which ties into - so I think you start with your portfolio and how do you feel about that and where are the opportunities to improve it are, which comes back to the capital we've been investing in the Upstream with the view that we got to - we're focused on bringing in more profitable, higher-value barrels and the divestment work that we've been doing, which we just touched on, which is taking the areas, the volumes in some of the projects were an asset that you feel like it may have a higher value to others and shifting those out of our portfolio. So that highgrading of the portfolio and the resulting change in the mix of our barrels and volumes, I think, is a very important part of the equation and one of the things we've been very focused on. I would just tell you, that is a big driver as you look across the competitive landscape, and one of the reasons why we've been so focused on that space. And then above and beyond that, when you think about the organizational construct, how you're managing that, the focus that you've got, end-to-end focus along that value chain, that has been a very big change that we've made in the organization. I think we're seeing the benefits of that today in how we're running Upstream, and my expectation is we'll continue to see additional benefits manifest themselves with time. And that's with respect to effectiveness and responding more effectively to market signals and delivering value there, and it's also a function of efficiency in terms of additional cost reduction. So, I would expect to continue to see an evolving, improving business in the Upstream, just as I expect to see that in our Chemical and Downstream business. Roger Read : Great, thank you. Jack Williams : In addition, Roger, to the divestments and the OpEx and efficiency work we're doing, just the profitability of the investments, I've mentioned earlier, there is not any other - Guyana doesn't have a peer out there right now, and we have a large position there and continue to grow it. So it's going to make a big impact over time. Darren Woods : Operator, we probably have time for one more question. Operator : Q - Jason Gabelman : Jason Gabelman : Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I first wanted to come back to shareholder distributions, if I can. It looks like the quarterly dividend has been flat for, now, a couple of years. Can you just discuss if there was start, an increase in the dividend this quarter, what needs to happen to increase the dividend moving forward, and maybe connect that to debt levels, and connected to that, what do you consider some sort of shareholder distribution strategy that gives cash to shareholders as oil prices are kind of above any long-term trend you expect? And then my second question is on Chemicals. It seems like the segment kind of has a lack of transparency with two respects, one in their performance product earnings, and two, on benefits to greenhouse gas emissions. So on the performance products, can you discuss what that's contributing currently, if there was kind of an outsized benefit because of the overall Chemicals' environment strength, and what kind of a normalized earnings looks like moving forward in that performance products? And then related to emissions, you mentioned that the performance products really helped with emissions reductions, but Exxon maybe doesn't get that benefit because it's not like a Scope 3 reduction, or your own emissions reductions. Is there any thought to supporting kind of emissions reporting scheme that awards Exxon for producing products that helps the world reduce emissions, even if it doesn't reduce your own emissions? That's it. Sorry, I know that was a lot, but I appreciate it. Darren Woods : I appreciate your questions, Jason, and I'm going to - I will let Jack talk to the chemical piece of your question and I'll address the capital allocation. I will though, just on the Chemical one, we do look at that in terms of the product emissions and we do recognize the opportunity that Chemicals brings in terms of helping society achieve that lower emissions. That is something that we talk a lot about. We've - gas is another one I would add, with respect to the alternatives that are out there today. So it is an important part of the equation that we think about and continue to work. And I'm less focused on how you take credit for it, more focused on making sure that it happens. But I'll let Jack spend some more time on that. With respect to your capital allocation and the dividends, I would tell you that the foundational elements of our capital allocation remain unchanged with respect to making sure that we're finding high-return, industry-advantaged investments, because that underpins basically everything else we do for the long term. We are a capital-intensive industry and so you better be making sure that you've got a good program of investments in capital, particularly in the depletion side of the business. And maintaining the balance sheet has always been an important part we do down heavily and that advantage paid off last year, and we're going to rebuild that. So as you said, that's part of our strategy. And then shareholders distributions have been the third leg of that stool and an important aspect. And so with respect to that question you heard, we think we've got a good plan on our investments and the range that we'll be investing going forward. We're making good progress on the debt, particularly given the higher-price environments than anticipated. And then on distribution, it is part of the conversation and discussions we've had. I would tell you, we have always felt a very strong commitment to our base shareholders to deliver on a dividend, a reliable and growing dividend, and that continues to be part of the conversation, and I would say the Board would like to continue to deliver on that commitment. And so we're continued - we're committed to that, a reliable dividend and one that grows with time. And obviously, if we're maintaining capital in the range that we won't - we get our debt back to levels that assure us the ability to ride through the cycles, and we've got a manageable dividend that's reliable and growing, recognizing anytime you raised the dividend, that brings of the burden up. We want to - we're going to continue to do that, but at the same time there, we want to manage that total outlay in the dividend. And so, buybacks and other distributions become part of that equation, particularly when to redistribute cash. So that's all on the table, and I think as we move through this year, and depending on where price is at, those opportunities will grow in relevance. And with a capital program that's pretty well defined and a debt that we - objective that's pretty well defined, you've got this opportunity on the distributions that I think the Board will continue to evaluate as we go forward. Jack Williams : So back on the performance products, there are - it's about, think about - that's about a third of our product portfolio in Chemicals, and I showed you that's going to grow at 70% by 2027 and, importantly, grow earnings more, and that's because that 10% to 25% uplift we generally get on our performance products. And I think that was demonstrated, if you look at this quarter. A lot of - almost all the chemical companies benefited from the dynamics we had in the quarter, but you saw the earnings power of our Chemicals company because of this higher margin, because of the technology we bring in those performance products. And the other advantage those have and when you think about all our investments going forward, these investments are focused on generating those performance products, and they're not more capital-intensive, this is catalyst technology. So it's not more capital-intensive and yet, we get - we're having - we're generating a product that gets 10% to 25% more margin. So you can imagine those investments look more profitable as well. So it's a key part of our strategy going forward and we're - we'll just continue to double down on that in terms of the technology improvements and growing those products preferential to the rest of our Chemical portfolio. Stephen Littleton : Okay, Thank you. I want to thank Darren and Jack for joining us on the call. And I also want to thank all those on the line. We appreciate your interest and opportunity to highlight our second quarter results. We hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you, and please be safe. Operator : And this concludes today's call.

Today's call is being recorded and at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter earnings call. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kathryn Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  The full set of presentation slides, and prepare remarks were made available on the Investor Relations section of our website earlier this morning along with our press release. During our call this morning, Darren will provide a few additional opening comments, and reference a select number of slides from that presentation leaving more time for your questions. We expect to conclude the call at 9 :30 AM Central Time. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2, and to the supplemental information at the end of the presentation slides on the website. I will now turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Stephen. Good morning. It's good to be with you today to discuss our strong third quarter results, and the progress we're making in growing shareholder value, and of course, to take your questions. I'd like to start by welcoming Kathy to the call, her first in what I know will be many. I can tell you that Kathy has hit the ground running, seamlessly joined the management team and has been broadly welcomed by the organization. While early in her tenure, we're already benefiting from her diverse experiences, and wise counsel.  Since we posted a full set of slides and remarks on the website, I'll keep my comments brief this morning. Starting with an overview of the work we're doing to position the Company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our first priority was to significantly grow the value of our base business to achieve industry-leading earnings and cash flow growth. This is work that has been ongoing for some time. And it's built on the significant the changes we have made to our organization and the increased focus on fully leveraging all of our competitive advantages, in technology, scale, integration, functional excellence, and most importantly, our people. It has also allowed us to improve operating performance, drive down cost, and develop a portfolio of industry advantaged high return investments. Our businesses are driving returns and generating cash to maintain a strong balance sheet and fund future investments. The work we began in 2018 to develop opportunities in carbon capture and later low emission fuels, plays to our competitive strengths, positions us to build a successful low carbon solutions business, and take a leading role in driving to a lower carbon future in hard to decarbonize areas. At the same time, we have to ensure our plans are robust to a wide range of future scenarios, including net zero pathways and the continuing use of hydrocarbons.  Our low carbon solutions business draws on the same core capabilities in competitive strengths used in our established businesses. This gives us optionality and builds resiliency into our plans. As the future takes shape and demand shift across our businesses, we will maintain our advantage. Now, I will turn to our third quarter performance. The value of the organization\u2019s hard work I just highlighted is showing itself as the market recovers. In the third quarter, we delivered excellent operational and financial performance with improved earnings and cash flow.  We significantly improved our cash position, reduced total debt, progressed key projects, and set a number of best-ever operational milestones. Earnings for the quarter were $6.8 billion. Year-to-date earnings surpassed $14 billion on the strength of our upstream portfolio and industry-leading chemical and downstream businesses. Last year during the pandemic, we worked to improve our cost structure by $3 billion versus 2019. That progress continued in the third quarter.  Our structural costs are now $4.5 billion lower than 2019 on an annual basis with a clear line of sight to continued improvements. Strong earnings and sound CapEx management resulted in cash flow after CapEx and dividends of $5.2 billion. We paid down approximately $4 billion of debt during the quarter and increased the dividend, maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth. Good progress and improving the earnings power of our business coupled with solid operating performance in a rapidly improving market, provides a good foundation for developing our future plans.  We will finalize our plans over the course of November and will provide additional details in early December. I would like to take the opportunity of this call to provide a brief overview of some key planned priorities and objectives. Starting with our operations. In 2020, we delivered industry-leading performance in safety and reliability. Our go-forward plans intend to sustain that leadership position. We also established objectives to significantly reduce emissions intensity by 2025. Our focus in this effort, more than paid off. We now expect to meet our objectives this year and are working to significantly raise the bar and reset our 2025 objectives. We're also ahead of schedule on our work to improve our cost structure, we expect to deliver more than the $6 billion in structural savings by 2023. We continue to find additional synergies and greater efficiency throughout our new organization. We expect to keep our capital spend within the previously communicated range of $20 billion to $25 billion. This represents a significant reduction versus our pre-pandemic plans. Over the changes we've made to our businesses are new project organization, and improved use of technology. We expect to deliver the same growth in earnings and cash flow as our pre-pandemic plans, offsetting the pandemic induced delays. In addition, we can free up funds to grow our low carbon solutions business and further accelerate efforts to reduce emissions. From 2022 to 2027, our cumulative capital investment in emission reduction projects is expected to be $15 billion. This year we made substantial progress in restoring the strength of our balance sheet. By year-end, we expect to be well within the debt-to-capital range of 20% to 25%. On Wednesday, we announced an increase in our dividend, adding to what is already a very attractive yield. In addition, given the improvements in our business and market conditions, we are expanding shareholder distributions by up to $10 billion over 12 to 24 months, through repurchase program beginning next year. Our plans are being built from the bottoms-up, with strong line ownership and a commitment to deliver. They are flexible and can be adjusted to adverse market conditions.  They strike a strong balance across our capital allocation priorities, drive continued efficiencies and significantly grow earnings and cash flow while competitively positioning us for a wide range of future scenarios, including net 0 pathways. We look forward to sharing more details with you later this year and into the first quarter of next year. With that, I will now turn it back to Steven. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Darren. Operator, please open the phone lines for the first question. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Littleton, the Questions-and-Answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We request that you limit your questions to one initial with one follow-up, so that may take as many questions as possible. Your first question will come from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. And Ms. Wai your line may be on mute. Looks like she disconnected. We'll take our first question instead from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and welcome, Kathy, and looking forward to working with you over the next several years, hopefully. Darren, I want to kick off just by the comment on the -- commend your restraint against the ludicrous question you were faced with yesterday. I'm not sure all of it stood up to the same level of patience through that testimony. And that -- at least usually it's my first question, which is you're -- you've got a new Board, or at least a refresh Board and you've now come out with this updated low carbon gas investment strategy going forward.  I'm just curious when the new Board members have got to look under the hoods at the relative investment opportunities you have, the carbon intensity of those, the returns, the cash -- free cash margin expansion opportunities, and so on, I'm just curious how perceptions of the new Board members relative to what external perceptions might be, how those have evolved as you've had a chance to present your strategy to those folks. Darren Woods : Thank you, Doug, and good morning. I think maybe just start with maybe a little broader comment on the Board and the discussions we've been having, which I would tell you, it's -- we've got additional diversity of perspective in the Board. It's bringing a very engaged Board across the entire group, and a lot of good constructive discussions. And to your point, I think as folks come into the Company and look under the hood and get an understanding of how we approach and look at these businesses, the opportunities that we have and how our advantages manifest themselves in those opportunities. I think there's a generally, I'd describe it a sound solid consensus across the board in terms of the recognition of the strength of the portfolio that we have, and a recognition of the industry-leading position that our investment in our projects have.  I would also say, and as you know, we -- you mentioned low carbon investments. We launched that business earlier this year, but if you'll recall from our Investor day, I talked about that in the context of ventures that we established starting back in 2018, looking at carbon capture opportunities, and then a little later on the low emission fuels opportunities. And what we're focused on there was, how do we find these investment opportunities to help drive lower emissions going forward, but do that in a way that's accretive to the shareholders, and one that distinguishes us from the rest of industry. And so, it's really looking for a formula that leverages our existing competitive advantages. And what we tried to share in the Investor Day last year and we'll continue to talk about and spend more time talking about at the Investor Day next year, is we think we have found a really good mix of opportunities that are very well aligned with our core capabilities.  And therefore, as we move forward, can invest in both our established businesses. Given some of the policy that exist around the world, there are opportunities to invest in a low carbon solutions business and still generate a very solid return from that. And then as we move and the growth manifests itself across that portfolio. Because we're drawing on those same capabilities, we have the ability to shift resources with -- between those and make sure that we're responding to the developments in the marketplace.  And that strategy, that discussion that we've been having with the Board, I think is recognized as a unique capability that this Company has. Our global footprint gives us exposure to a very broad set of markets and as those markets develop somewhat uniquely with respect to the transition, we can adjust our approach in those markets selectively to make sure that we're on the front end of that and taking advantage of the opportunities as they develop. So, I think there's a strong recognition of the advantages that we bring to this space as a whole. Doug Leggate : Well, thanks for that. [Indiscernible] the answer, Darren, I don't want this to be my follow-up. Just a clarification. The 15 billion is about 8%, I guess, consistent with I think the other US peers so we shouldn't expect a big strategic pivots here, aka some of the European models, is that fair? Darren Woods : I think that's right. And you know Doug it's -- this is -- I've been pleased with what I would say is a broader and growing recognition of the challenges of addressing this space and the number of solutions that are going to be needed. And in particular, a number of areas that we don't have complete solutions yet and the need for companies like ExxonMobil to help develop those.  So, we as you know, resisted what we think are some of the more, we call it commodity opportunities in this space and focused on where we don't have good solutions and where we can leverage a unique capability and therefore generate what we think will be unique returns. And that portfolio that we're talking about today, we're leveraging some proprietary technology to boost the returns there.  And so, our approach here is not going to be what I would call an industry standard, it's going to be advantaged projects like we've tried to generate in the rest of the portfolio. I think as you think about that 15 billion, part of it's around our growth projects and making sure that we are building resiliency into those growth projects by putting in the necessary investments in technology to lower the greenhouse gases. So those projects become that much more robust. And the returns that we're showing for those projects comprehend that spend to lower the emissions.  And then we've got new opportunities that we're pursuing that take advantage of some of the policy that are -- that's out there and generate returns. And then we're building and seeding what I would say the development of much larger scale projects that's going to require additional policy. And we're doing the work in anticipation of that, recognizing that as that policy front develops, we will be in a position to take advantage of that with projects that we've developed in anticipation of it. Doug Leggate : Thank you. My proper follow-up if I may, I'd like to ask Kathy a question if that's okay and also commend Stephen, for the prepared remarks put up in the slide deck, that's a terrific [illumination] (ph) for your disclosure. Thank you for that. Kathy, my question for you is, as an outsider so to speak coming in what do you see is the appropriate capital structure, dividend policy, dividend metrics like coverage and so on for a Company like ExxonMobil? How should we expect your stamp to be on that shareholder return dividend policy and so on going forward and obviously the buyback [and I assume is part of that as well] (ph)? Kathy Mikells : To take a step back and say, how do we think about capital allocation for the business, Doug. And I would start with, first of all, we've got to invest in the advantaged projects that we have that on very strong returns and that's from Guyana to things like bio-fuels and the Strathcona project. Obviously, we've been very focused on maintaining a strong dividend. I think the Company did a great job as it went through the pandemic, really protecting that dividend and that's a priority for us.  And with that, I have a strong balance sheet, and you've seen our focus over the course of this year in strengthening the balance sheet. In this quarter, we reduced debt by about $4 billion. After we consider those priorities, if we've got available cash, we will then look to distribute that to shareholders and you've obviously seen that in the buyback announcement that we had. I think it's important also to just recognize that the Company looks to have a balanced approach and maintain flexibility, would have seen the Company reduce its capital expending pretty significantly, in part to protect the dividend as the pandemic was ensuing. And so, we do have flexibility as we think about capital allocation, but those are our priorities. Obviously, share repurchase programs are an efficient way to distribute capital to shareholders, but that's how we think about it. Doug Leggate : Welcome again and thanks for taking my questions. Kathy Mikells : Thank you. Darren Woods : Thanks Doug. Operator : All right. We'll go back to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for getting me back in the queue. Apparently, I don't know how to operate my work phone anymore after maternity leave, so thank you. Stephen Littleton : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Maybe just following up on Doug's question, but asking it in a little different way, can you just talk about how the new Board is weighing evidence that increased oil and gas investment is probably warranted, not just from Exxon, but globally against what's becoming essentially a mandate from investors to allocate capital to the energy transition, and how does that seemingly dual mandate square with the current medium-term CapEx range? We know you reiterated it, but we understand that the low carbon solution and emission reductions that will now have a larger share and that CapEx spend is extending beyond the medium-term range. Darren Woods : I'll start off with that and then if Kathy 's got anything to add on I'll pass it onto her. You talked about a dual mandate and that's really the challenge that we face as a Company. And I think more broadly as a society which is clearly a drive to move to a lower emissions energy system and a lower emissions future. But at the same time recognizing that the need for energy today is real and continuing to grow.  And I think striking that balance and thoughtfully moving forward and trying to make sure that as you're transitioning from one source to another, that you do in a way that it doesn't penalize populations and compromise people's standards of living. You see a little maybe evidence of the challenge there when you look at what's happening in Europe and some of the constraints as we've come out of the pandemic to depletion business and the lack of investment that the industry broadly had in 2019 going into -- severely into 2020 and still coming out of that in 2021. And then the growth in demand, you put those two together lack of demand, lower supply growing lack of -- lower supply and lower investments and then the growth in demand, you get these pinch points. And so, I think the Board and management were very conscientious of that and recognize our challenge is to leverage our perspective, the experience that we have in this space, our understanding of it and to try to strike the appropriate balance and make sure we're moving forward at a pace, in fact, leading industry as we drive to the slower emissions future, but not leave whole communities behind and penalize them with respect to their standards of living and access to affordable and reliable energy. And the investments that we're making, I think strike that balance.  I've been very pleased that the work that we started back in 2018, 2019, and all -- and through 2020. difficult to see during the pandemic with the collapse in the demand. But I think today as we come out of that and you see the market recovery, the benefits of those structural changes that we have made are manifesting themselves. We're able to generate the same kind of value with a lot less capital in a lot less expense and that's been because of the work we've done with our organization and the emphasis on leveraging our competitive advantages and foremost among those, our people and the work that they've done through this timeframe and the technology that we've brought to bear in some of this work.  We -- if you look at the capital portfolio that we had coming into the pandemic, none of the projects -- we haven't dropped any of the projects. We're still moving those forward. As you know, we paused them. But if you look at the spend associated with those projects, we've actually managed to bring that spend down.  And I think that's a testament to our new project\u2019s organization. A lot of good work manifesting itself in the results that you're seeing and in the future that we're laying out, the ability to do what we said we were going to do more efficiently, and then expand into the lower carbon area, where we're finding with the work that we've done opportunities in that space as well. Jeanine Wai : Hey, great. Thank you. And then I guess my second question -- our second question is on the share repurchases. So, for the repurchases over the next 12 to 24 months, how did you decide on the up to $10 billion level and the 2-year time frame, and I guess we're just curious about what conditions will determine the pace and the ultimate amounts? Kathy Mikells : Sure. Overall, we decided the amount in the pacing looking out at our future plans and what our expectations were against the capital allocation priorities that I walked through earlier relative to the free cash flow that we're expecting we're going to generate. Now, obviously market conditions have a lot to do with exactly what that's going to turn out to be, hence the range that we provided and the range in timing that we provided. But I think you should start off thinking about that as rateables over that two-year range that we discussed. And then we'll assess market conditions in terms of adjusting the pace of the program over time. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next question will be from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey, good morning. I want to get your thoughts on asset sales first. As the slides highlight, you're making some progress in certain opportunities there. In the past, you've talked about a broader $15 billion program pre - COVID. And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about asset sales as part of your portfolio optimization or streamlining over the long term and does the $15 billion-plan still hold as we look out these next few years? Darren Woods : Good morning, Phil. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I would tell you the work that we did prior in announcing that divestment was really around high grading the portfolio, and what we laid out was what we thought was the opportunity. That portfolio set in terms of the assets that we're looking at hasn't changed from the standpoint of anything coming out.  In fact, what I would say is we continue to evaluate where we can better leverage our competitive strengths and high-grade that portfolio, I think you'd see the opportunity set that underpins that divestment portfolio growth. And then of course, our ability to execute those opportunities and high graded the asset portfolio will be a function of, obviously finding buyers who put a value on that, that's consistent with what we think we need in order to take that out of the portfolio. So that's work going on. I would tell you; we did a lot of work last year maintaining our push in this space, but not willing to really push anything out to a market where we didn't see the value that we expected to get. I think as the markets now recover, much more attractive market to sell into, and we're seeing the kind of buyer response and valuations that we think are more consistent with what we're looking for. So, my view is we'll see continued progress in that space and I would expect it to pick up here compared to certainly 2020 when the market was much more challenging. Phil Gresh : Got it. And if I could ask just one more question on the buybacks, the strength in chemicals right now, the improving downstream environment, it would seem like you should be able to cover your dividend at about $50 Brent, looking at 2022, even if CapEx were higher in that $20 to $25 billion range. And if I were to layer in $5 billion of buybacks, that'd be about $10 in the oil price.  So, it would seem like the ratable plan could be covered at maybe $60 Brent and obviously prices are higher than that. I'm just curious if you think that math is reasonable and if it is right that maybe excess cash could still go to either more buybacks or towards more Balance Sheet deleveraging and just how you think about those. Thank you. Darren Woods : Again, I'll start off and then if Kathy has got anything to add, invite her to chip in there. I would say your break-even calculations are significantly higher than what ours are. And of course, one of the issues is we haven't had the opportunity to take you through the plan that's in development and the reviews that we're having with our board. That's I think to come, but the work that we've been doing and what I've referenced here so far on the call with respect to the OpEx reductions that we're seeing in the opportunity frankly that we see going forward, and the capital productivity that we're now demonstrating.  And I'd put that really in two buckets. 1, is the project organization which I continually refer back to, but to me it's been such a huge success to leverage what were very strong organizations across the corporation, centralizing that, bringing it together, and making sure that we're putting the best resources in the target -- on the projects that best fit the need. Their capabilities are really resulting in some significant capital efficiency improvements. And the other thing -- the other bucket would be technology.  We laid out a plan -- I'll just focus on the Permian for now, but we laid out a plan there to pre-invest, to do a lot of delineation to understand what we had there. We were working on bringing in some technology, doing quite a bit of trialing and testing, which again required some upfront capital. We put in an -- if you recall what I call the long ball game, which is leveraging ExxonMobil 's strengths into a Permian and move from what was I considered a short game and the Permian to a long ball and that's paying off and we're seeing that work that we're doing out in the Permian deliver the same value for a lot less spend. And that's a function of that organization and the work that they've been doing to really drive their efficiencies, but also to fully leverage the capability of the broader ExxonMobil corporation and our technology portfolio. So that's how I'd say we're going to be able to do everything we've talked about. And frankly, depending on how the market is. As you know, it's really hard to call the market and we built some plans with some pretty wide ranges and we're robust to some very low-price environments going forward that won't compromise the capital allocation balance that we've talked about. And if we find the market is higher than that low side, we will have additional cash and resources to work on and give that challenge to Kathy, but maybe let her talk about that for a minute. Kathy Mikells : Just one other thing that I'd address which you referenced and that's continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We clearly intend to do that. And so, at the end of this quarter, our leverage ratio landed at I think technically 25.3. And we've talked about the fact that as we look at the fourth quarter, we expect to move into a more comfortable zone within that range and further reduce that in the fourth quarter.  As we look out to next year, we do have debt coming due, which we would expect to retire, and so I would expect to see a bit of a further reduction in debt moving towards the lower end of that range over time. Again, we're looking to strike the right balance and, on the share, repurchase side, what the commodity cycle looks like as we enter 2022, is going to have a lot in determining what the rate and pace of the share repurchase program looks like. Phil Gresh : I appreciate the additional thoughts. Thanks. Darren Woods : Thanks, Phil. Operator : And next we'll go to Devin Mc Dermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin Mc Dermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Darren Woods : Good morning, Devin. Devin Mc Dermott : Hey. So, the first one I wanted to ask on is just on some of the cost and efficiency trends. You've done a really good job executing on some of the structural savings that you talked about previously and the latest message is now to exceed the $6 billion target by 2023. I was wondering if in light of that you comment on whether or not you're seeing any inflationary trends across the portfolio, be it through labor, inflation, service cost inflation, and the extent you are some of the ability to offset that as we look into 2022 and beyond. Darren Woods : Sure. I would tell you I don't think we're immune to the pressures that are impacting just about every other business out there all around the world. And so, we certainly seeing some aspects of that in our business if I start with the big spend area with respect to our capital in projects. think somewhat, maybe counter-intuitively, the fact that we were working on those going into the pandemic and we went into the pandemic, I think we took somewhat of a longsighted approach with respect.  We didn't just step out of those projects, instead we worked with our partners and contractors to think about how we put these projects on pause and then bring them back up in a thoughtful way as and when the market would enable that. And so, the work that we did last year and working with our partners allowed us to give them some certainty around work and opportunities going forward.  And we were able to lock in some of the market factors at that point in time. In the capital space, I think we've done a pretty good job and will be pretty well positioned to offset a lot of those -- or not experience a lot of those inflationary pressures. In the base business certainly the higher price of energy is impacting our manufacturing.  We're advantaged in that space generally because most of our facilities are more energy efficient than our competitors and so while that's raising cost across the board with that advantage, we're able to stay below where the rest is. And of course, market prices move in these commodity markets based on the marginal cost for the suppliers but the last barrel supply. So that's we're able -- I think that's being offset with the margins.  And then, I'd say more generally, what's left with respect to supply chain and inflationary pressures with the organizations that we have in place, and them up and running now, and then a much richer environment with higher margins and more activity. They are able to take the efficiencies and the synergies that we've captured with new organization and the different approaches that we're now taking and apply that in a more, let me call it, target-rich environment.  So, we're able to find those efficiencies and offset a lot of inflation. So, the different aspects happening in different parts of the business. But generally, that inflationary pressure, we're managing to basically cope with it and still deliver on the earnings growth that we set for ourselves, the target we set for ourselves. Devin Mc Dermott : Great. Very helpful. And my second question is on the Permian. Very strong results in the quarter, a pretty sizable increase in the production expectation for this year, as well. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the trends you're seeing there from an operational improvement in capital efficiency standpoint, knowing that you did some of the pre -investment that you mentioned before, that's helping on the efficiency side here and then also the cadence that's kind of spend in activity as we look into 2022. Darren Woods : Sure. Well, as you know, we had this contiguous acreage that we recognize would be advantaged with respect to trying to develop what would be -- I'll call it a more manufacturing approach in the Permian. You'll recall we made some upfront investments around, 1 delineating that acreage to make sure we knew what we had, because I think as Neil's talked in the past about, not all of that acreage is the same.  The reservoirs are different as you move around that -- the area up there, and so making sure that we were thinking -- focusing on the areas where we had the highest productivity. But at the same time making sure that any area that we approach, that we optimized everything in the subsurface and weren't going for just high initial rates, but instead looking at maximum recovery. And that's paid off. We invested in the corridors, we invested in the infrastructure to make sure that we are in a position to once we focused in on and identified the areas, we wanted to develop that we could do that in a very cost-efficient way and that is now paying off. As you look at what we're doing in the Permian, it is much more of a manufacturing mindset and very focused on efficiencies. And you're seeing that in the results and some of the metrics that are out there.  And then the third area is, and it continues to, I think yield benefits is, thinking about how we bring our fundamental science and technology capabilities from the broader organization, from some -- from our corporate research group and bring that into play here in the Permian and then the unconventional space. And that is paying off as well, we've gotten I think some very positive results from some of our technologies that we've brought into the field. We're continuing to try our new technology.  So, my expectation is we'll continue to see that manifest itself in better production and better capital efficiency and that's those would be the three pieces of the equation that I think are resulting in the performance that you're seeing. With respect to the overall activity, what we're trying to do is make sure that we stay within the boundaries of what I just talked about and not as we maximize what we can do within that space, making sure we don't get ahead of the technology work that we're doing and making sure we don't get outside those core doors and some of those optimized areas of production.  And that's the balance and the debate that we're striking. And we may see a couple more rigs come on here as we go forward in staying within that same philosophy. I wouldn't see us starting to venture out into other areas that are outside, that optimize space and plan until we've done the work to optimize plans around that next tier of opportunities out there. Devin Mc Dermott : Great. Well, congrats on the great results. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Next, we got Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you. Darren Woods : Morning Sam. Sam Margolin : First question is on, back to the capital program and I recognize that we're in front of the board process and things are still being hammered out, but I think the way that the market is conceptualizing the range is that the spend for the underlying asset base today, including the growth projects is probably tighter than the range that you've communicated and the top end of the range is sort of a rainy day fund for a special opportunities that arise either in the low carbon sphere or otherwise.  Do you think that's a fair assessment as we think about 2022? And I think it flows into an earlier point about breakeven as well. How do we think about the outflow on CapEx within the range which obviously influences that commodity price break-even assessment? Kathy Mikells : Sure. Obviously, this year, our capital spending has been purposefully constrained and we think we're going to come in, I'd say at the lower end of that $16 billion to $19 billion range we've provided. We are expecting higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and a significant increase as we head into 2022. What underpins that is further investments in Guyana, focused on Auraiya (ph) Yellowtail appraisals, [Indiscernible] in Brazil is now moving into the startup of drilling and so more significant spending heading into there.  We obviously paused a number of downstream and chemical projects. Those are restarting, and so we'll start to see that spend in the fourth quarter and kick up pretty significantly into 2022. And I'd also mention that as we will look to accelerate our reductions in greenhouse gas, emissions and intensities specifically will be spending a bit more in that area. If you think about how that is going to cause us to kick up, I'd say that clearly will put us in that 20 to 25 billion range, and then clearly, we would leave ourselves some level of flexibility in that range for things that we can't fully anticipate as we sit here today. Sam Margolin : Thanks. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on carbon capture. The Reconciliation Bill is in the process now, there have been a few different drafts that have come out each with seems like distinct kind of carbon capture language and incentives in them. As you think about ExxonMobil 's plan and proposition in that asset class, how are the early returns that you've seen in these draft bills and do you think they're sufficient to drive a real acceleration in activity for you there? Darren Woods : Well, the way I would look at it, Sam, I think trying to predict what's coming out of that political process is, I don't know if it's as hard or harder than trying to predict where prices are going to go. So maybe just spend a little time talking about the philosophy that we've taken with respect to developing the low carbon business and again, I would start with foundationally the work that we're doing has to leverage some advantage.  We want to make sure that the investments that we're making here, we bring some unique value to and expect that unique value than manifest itself. In value for our shareholders. And so that's the foundation and I mentioned this carbon capture venture that we started back in 2018 in the low emission fuels and was how do we take advantage of the portfolio of technologies that we have and the skills and capabilities of our people to find ways to do this that are different and better than the rest of industry. So that's the foundation.  Then as a philosophy, making sure that we develop a portfolio that is accretive with existing policy. So not betting on the comp, not thinking that something is going to pop here and then developing projects that ultimately disappoint us. And so that -- and given that we've got a really broad footprint, we're able to tap into different policies around the world. And there are a number of governments since we launched low carbon solutions that have reached out to us, and want to work with us to understand how we can -- what we can bring to the equation to help advance some of their objectives.  And so those discussions are happening, but I would say there's a fundamental layer of investment that is accretive with existing policy. Don't look -- don't need more help. Then there's the other tier where [Indiscernible] certainly would not be regret investments, but we would need to see some additional policy tests to make those -- to give us the returns that we would expect given the resources we're bringing to bear with -- for those projects. And those are another we need to develop those now, because if we wait until the policies in place, will be behind the game. And so, we're being very thoughtful around developing those projects. It also informs what we're going to need, and so that we can very clearly articulate the policymakers all around the world, what would be required, and it starts this down what I would call that learning curve to better inform policymakers and then position us to respond to the policy as and when it comes.  Because I think one thing is very clear, in order for society to achieve this longer-term ambition, we're going to need different policies, additional policies around the world. We want to be helped to lead the industry, and the drive to lower emissions and then to take advantage and influence some of those policies. Sam Margolin : Thank you very much. Darren Woods : Sure. Operator : Next, we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning, Roger. Roger Read : Just wanted to probably a little bit follow-up and the questioning that Phil was doing earlier as we think about the 2025 goal of roughly $30 billion in earnings, we take this quarter and annualize it, not realize that's and just playing what math more than trying to force you into a corner, but you'd be at about $27 billion, and yes, prices are higher on the commodity front versus the $60 real, but what I wanted to understand as we look at the cash OpEx reduction that's pretty identifiable, then you have the portfolio.  And growth component. Where would you say you are on the portfolio and growth component today? And how should we think about that, maybe stair-stepping in over the next couple of years again against the sort of $60 real environment. Darren Woods : Let me just start in terms of how we think about that and make sure that we're holding ourselves in the organization to a standard that doesn't require market helps. So, the comment that we're making with respect to doubling the earnings and cash flow potential of the business. We try to normalize for price environment.  So, we're not going to take any help from the market or assumed up from the market, but instead, assume constant price basis and make sure that the work that we're doing, our structural improvements, and so that if the markets there -- inconsistent, then we'll double it, if it's higher, we'll do even more than that, and if it's lower, we'll still be in a very robust position. And so that's how we think about it in this year's -- certainly this quarter's margins are not consistent with the basis that we're using for longer term.  We are getting some advantage from the market today. We don't assume that it's something that manifest itself through the plan. And so that's I think an important foundation to evaluate the comments that were making. Talked about a structure efficiency that's obviously huge part. And as I said, when we get through the plan, get that endorsed, and when we come out, start speaking and take you through their Investor Day, we'll spend more time explaining where some of those savings are coming from. That'll be a really important contributing factor.  And then with respect to the projects in the businesses, I think as you look across each of those, the projects are delivering what we expected. In fact, in many cases, delivering more than we had anticipated for the things that we started off. I'll give you just a couple of examples, if you look at investments that we've already made in the Gulf Coast and our chemical plants, those are running well above the AR basis, reliability and throughput much higher than we expected. So that's delivering more value.  You look at the Rotterdam hydrocracker out in Europe, and that was a new-to-the-world technology, upgrading very low value streams into high value lubricant products that is performing very, very well and delivering well above the basis. And so -- and if you look at our chemicals business and the high-performance products, a lot of the growth and value that we see in that business comes from continuing to penetrate the market with these differentiated high value products and the chemical organizations doing a great job at continuing to grow that and to demonstrate the value of those technical benefits to our customers so that they in turn can realize some benefit from those products. Those are all working very well. And finally, in the downstream. a lot of work to make sure that we are driving efficiencies into that business and then squeezing, upgrading every molecule we can into the higher value segments, the projects that we've talked about in that space are doing just that, just high grading the molecules and getting more value, and when you combine that with reduced cost, refine business is better positioned, and of course the lubricants business, again, a differentiated high-value, technology-driven products.  They are really doing very, very well, growing their business. And this year we're seeing record earnings in there. So can you look at across one of the advantages of having such a diverse portfolio is it gives us a lot of strength and levers to pull, to grow value. And so, you see that and all of them. And then of course, the final point I would make is and I've been making throughout this call is we're able to deliver those a lot of those projects in those benefits at a much lower cost, a lot less capital. And so that's playing into the benefits that we've laid out in the deck. Roger Read : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then follow-up question. LNG markets have gone -- they've been really strong I guess, let's say, Global Gas. We know that over the last couple of years there seem to be some hesitancy from consumer side on signing term contracts. You're -- you've got some projects obviously, that are potentially ready to go and some others that are in process. And I was just wondering, any clarity you can offer in terms of changing customer behavior, or willingness to sign term contracts in the LNG market right now? Darren Woods : No, I think certainly, if anything, what I would suggest is that some of the challenges that they're seeing in the global gas market just reinforces the importance of secure sources of supply and the reliable source of supply. And so, I don't -- we haven't seen what I would say is any material shifts in terms of how the market and the consumers in those markets are looking at the opportunities in this space. Kathy Mikells : Yeah. And our portfolio is heavily weighted to long-term contracts. About 80%, so we'd expect that to continue to be the case. Roger Read : Thank you. Operator : All right. Next, we'll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning, team. Darren have you -- guys have a unique perspective into the state of global oil and liquids demand given your large downstream footprint, will love your perspective of where you see us real-time in the demand recovery, how you see the path forward and then how that ties into whether we're going to see refining margins back to mid-cycle or above in 2022. Darren Woods : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Neil. So, what I would say is we are definitely seeing around the world a recovery with respect to economic activities and of course with that comes the recovery in energy demand. I would say that it stops and starts so to speak, as you move around the world with some of the variance that we're seeing with COVID slow things down and then pick back up again. But generally, as you look around the world, seeing recovery, if you look across what I would say the primary transportation. fuels.  Let's say road transport, commercial transport, heavy-duty transport, those are getting back to where they were historically. And so, I would say the recovery -- you can clearly see that recovery is in place. The thing that's lagging, which I'm sure we all recognize given our own personal circumstances is air travel is lagging of that recovery. It is improving, continues to improve quarter-on-quarter. We saw an improvement this quarter.  And so, I think ultimately when you see that demand balance recover and when I say demand balance, I mean across a barrel of crude as it moves into the transportation markets. It's going to require air travel to get back to where it was. And then it'll just be a function about how strong that economic growth is that drives that -- the activity and then the demand.  And that will of course be balanced with the amount of capacity that is available to meet that demand. So as always, supply and demand balance will be the primary factor. There's been a lot of refinery closure, in a lot higher rate than there has been. These high energy prices through gas and LNG are going to put some additional pressure on some of the less advantaged refineries. So, I think we got to see how that plays out, but our view is, this -- the downstream business, when it has a peak or goes through a tight supply demand balance, it doesn't last very long. So, we're really gearing that business up to be successful and at very low margin environment. And we're leveraging and focusing our efforts on refineries that are integrated with our chemicals business and integrated with our lubricants business so that we aren't dependent and reliant upon just the fuels market, but instead have a much more diversified product slate that taps into some of the higher value products. Kathy Mikells : And then I'd just comment as we look at industry utilization it's kind of approaching, I'll call it the lower-end of what the 10-year range would look like. So as Jack recovers here slowly over time, that should give us some further opportunity for improvement. Neil Mehta : Thanks team. The follow-up is on the clean energy announcement today. The $15 billion of capital, how should we think about the returns associated with that, and is there a target that you have in mind? I go back to one of your competitors inventory transition day where they said $10 billion of capital and maybe a billion dollars of cash flow in the out-years. Do you anticipate providing a quantification of cash flow associated with those $15 billion of investments, and how do you think about the hurdle rates in terms of those investments? And a tie into that, as you think about bio-fuels versus hydrogen, versus carbon capture, is there anything that really stands out as having outsized economic return at this point? Kathy Mikells : Sure. So [Indiscernible], I would start with by taking a step back and saying, we expect double-digit returns across all of our business and we don't look at this business really any differently. If I look specifically at the capital that I'd say is targeted towards the low carbon solutions business so different from the emissions reductions that we're making across our own portfolio, either our existing business or the growth projects and looking to offset those incremental emissions that would come with growth projects.  What I'd say is we look at that and say we think we can see really strong double-digit returns coming from there. Now, we have a lot of biofuel projects that are embedded there, which are supported by current policy. There's Takona project up in Canada would be a great example of that. Clearly, we are seeing some investments. Darren referenced the Houston Hub project where we have to seed those investments today. Carbon capture doesn't need fuller policy support. We referenced that earlier in the discussion today.  But if we don't start to see the planning for those investments, we will be behind when the policy support comes. And it's clear if we're going to make more progress towards a lower carbon future, more policies support does have to come. That is how we're thinking about it, and we see great opportunities in the space that we're targeting where we think the Company really brings advantage. Carbon capture, hydrogen, biofuels is our current focus, and we think we're going to be able to prosecute those projects and earn good returns. Darren Woods : And I would add to that, Neil. If you think -- just take biofuels, as Kathy mentioned, Strepto interproject. And that's not what I would say is an industry standard biofuels project. We're leveraging our process, technology -- our catalyst technology to try change the value proposition there. And that's true with what we're looking at in hydrogen. And obviously we've got some work that we're doing and carbon capture.  So, in all those areas, it's coming back to -- and the challenge, given the organization, the standard we're holding ourselves to, we've got to find a way to do this, meet this demand as this need of a lower-carbon, lower emissions future, but doing it in a way that's advantaged and therefore brings value to shareholders. And that we're not letting go there, we're making sure that the organization understands we're going to do both. Not an or equation. Neil Mehta : Very clear. Thank you, guys. Stephen Littleton : So, Operator, Darren, and Kathy we probably have time for one more question. Darren Woods : Okay. Operator : Okay. So, we will take our last question from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning Paul. Paul Cheng : Two questions please. Good morning. First is for four Cap rate and that maybe let me add my welcome to the end of the line. You are the first person from outside joined the Company management committee. And also, with that quite frankly, for the past, say, 30 year, ExxonMobil haven't official CFO grow. So, half that you jaw enough that you have been there for several months.  How you think about the process in the What's your O and M as well as the criteria, Do you see that's room for change or adjustment or that you think the current process is pretty good and you don't really have any changes that need to be made? So that's the first question. For the second question, Darren, when we are looking at your CapEx has always been for at least that for the past 18 months at 20, 25 billion for the next several years. You maintain that, but your spending for the low top and is going to be increased by [Indiscernible] roughly $2 billion a year from previously may maybe 5, $600 million to say 2.5 billion now.  If the incremental spending is all being absorbed because you doing better in other business. And be able to squeeze or this savings or that some NCA SI (ph) project has been pushed out, if they are, what are those and what does the low top in business say you targeting I think is 10% plus return. Is that going to be better than the project that you have pushed out and what we voted said is Mosambi (ph) is noticeable missing in your press release when you're talking about the strategic investment, can you give an update on that? Thank you. Kathy Mikells : Hey. Well, I will start in and I guess the first thing that I would say is, I've been really pleased with how the organization has actually welcomed me. You can imagine coming into a Company like ExxonMobil. I would say I was a little bit anxious about what the receptivity would be, and both at the management committee, I'd say across the senior leadership team and across the Company, people have just been really welcoming, which has been terrific.  The other thing I would say is as I look at many of the companies\u2019 processes, I'm really pleased by how rigorous and thorough they are. ExxonMobil puts a lot of work behind things before it comes out and then makes decisions and talks about those things. And so, you mentioned our FID process, which I think is incredibly rigorous.  And the Company added sometime back a process that they call red blue team, which is literally putting really smart people and competing them against each other to say, hey, as we're going to FID this project, tell us what a different perspective is, and whether the project could be even better than what our base economics are, and tell us what a different perspective might be in terms of what some of the call it hidden risks might be in the project, and have we evaluated all of that?  And that's the process where I'd say we take all of those learning's and then the base economics, how we're managing the risks of the projects, just get improved to an even greater level. So, I'd say I've been really pleased just by the thorough work that's done across the Company. And I'd take that even into a different area we haven't talked about it on the call, but obviously net zero is the topic of the day and the Company is clearly doing a lot of work in terms of its own scenario analysis.  We talked a lot about the announcement we made in increasing our investment in the low carbon emission space and again, all I would comment on is that the rigor of the work that you see at the Company is incredible. The work that we're doing on a site by site, location by location basis in staring at our cost curves and the plans and how we're going to reduce our own carbon footprint. I just think it is incredibly thorough and detailed and it's what enables us to really stand strongly behind our plan. So anyway, I've been really pleased and I'm really happy with just how the organization has accepted me as an outsider. Darren Woods : I will just add, Paul, I think it doesn't feel like Kathy is an outsider quite frankly, I mean, she has come in and joined the team and I'm not sure that anybody on the management committee thinks of her any different than the rest of us, so it's been I think a really nice fit, and she brings in a different perspective which is very valued and it's added to the discussions and the debates that we've been having and we're going to continue to have.  With respect to the questions that you've asked me, I didn't quite catch the last one, but I'll address your first around the incremental spending and how given we haven't changed the range, but it feels a little bit like the portfolio mix is changing. How do we -- where did that come from? How do we think about that?  And so, what I would tell you is probably 3 components of how with our evolving plans and the work that we're doing in particularly the additional spend in low - carbon solutions, how we're doing that within the same band of the range of capital that we've projected or given all of you. Savings is clearly one of them and I've mentioned that quite a bit throughout the call, so I won't go back around that again, but that has made a difference, the ability -- you remember what we said we wanted to do was double earnings and double cash flow, and that's been the objective. It hasn't been a volumes game, it hasn't been our capital spend game is around how do you do that and do it in most effectively, and as we've found ways to do it more effectively, that's allowed us to take off some of the capital spending. That's an important component of it. There are -- there have been some shifting as there always is in this space and so if you think about some of the LNG projects there has been some movement on that Mozambique and the work that we've been doing there and the collaboration with Total with some of the issues that we've seen in Mozambique.  That has slipped some, but we're still committed to that project. We see that as a valuable opportunity, but we're going to have to do that in the time frame available to us with some of the constraints that we see today. So, there is some movement in some of those projects. Obviously, we delayed the downstream and chemical projects. Those are coming back up again, but that shifted the pattern a little bit, so there's some of that in there.  And then the third bucket I would say is we always left ourselves some headroom, and that headroom is -- continues in there. We've got flexibility. We never -- there's always -- I think the question out there about where we had 20 and where we had 25. I'd say we're somewhere around there and it moves from year-to-year, and we give ourselves a little bit of space, recognizing that things are going to move around very difficult to predict some of the scheduling movement around there. That's how I would think about it, those three buckets.  And frankly, the way we judge that is ultimately does that movement inhibit our ability to deliver on the value proposition that we laid out. And that was -- is one of the points that why we really want to emphasize that we are going to deliver on the earnings and cash flow growth, which is what we have been driving the organization to do because we believe ultimately that underpins growing TSR total shareholder return. And the last point, Kathy you have -- Kathy Mikells : I think you already touched a little bit upon what I thought was your last Paul, and that was about Mozambique. And our core project is clearly moving forward and you touched upon the project that we pause simply because of the security situation on the ground, which we'll continue to look at and revisit overtime. Paul Cheng : Still -- you guys are still committed to that because I think there's some market rumors that Exxon may be [Indiscernible] whatever you want to get -- to be in that projects. Darren Woods : Yeah, I wouldn't put a lot of faith in the market rumors that you guys know, Paul, there is a lot of people talking. Most of them don't have a good understanding of the discussions that we're having and how -- we see that as a very competitive resource. It's large. We've got opportunities with Totale that we've been working on. They're committed to the project. We got really good working relationship with them as well as our other partners and our existing but I think we'll continue to develop that. We think that's going to be very competitive in the long term and something that's going to be needed so that we're committed -- we continue to be committed to them. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Stephen Littleton : Okay. Darren and Kathy, we want to thank you for joining us and for all on the call. Thanks for your time and above all questions this morning, we hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you and please be safe. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations and Secretary, Mr. Stephen Littleton. Please go, sir. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings release. We appreciate your participation and continued interest in ExxonMobil. I am Stephen Littleton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The full set of presentation slides and prepared remarks are made available on the Investor Relations section of our website earlier this morning, along with our press release. During our call this morning, Darren will provide a few additional opening comments and reference a select number of slides from that presentation, leaving more time for your questions. We expect to conclude the call at 9 :30 a.m. Central Time. I would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement on Slide 2, and through the supplemental information at the end of the presentation slides on the website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thanks Stephen. It\u2019s a pleasure to share our 2021 results with you today, which demonstrates the significant progress we\u2019ve made to advance our strategy and position the company to sustainably grow shareholder value. Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down cycle and structural cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefit of the market recovery last year. We delivered strong financial and operating performance, significantly increased earnings and cash flow to fund our advantaged investments, reduced debt to pre-pandemic levels, and continued our long history of sharing our success with shareholders. Today, we\u2019ll outline some of our progress towards reaching our strategic goals, to lead in earnings and cash flow growth, drive to a net-zero future, build successful lower-emissions businesses, and maintain optionality in our portfolio to match the pace of the energy transition. Let me touch on a couple of key points. First, we\u2019re working to fully leverage our competitive advantages, including our scale, to drive step changes in cost and efficiency. We\u2019re also actively managing our strong portfolio and continuing our keen focus on operating performance and disciplined capital and operating spend. We\u2019re also accelerating our work to reduce emissions and drive innovations focused on the hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry and commercial transportation. An important part of this activity is our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions from our operations by 2050. Also important is the good progress we\u2019ve made building our Low Carbon Solutions business, which is rapidly expanding, utilizing existing policy. As you\u2019re all aware, we\u2019re also pursuing very large-scale opportunities that will give us first-mover advantage as we advocate for the new policy necessary to support these step-out projects. Our results demonstrate the benefits of the actions we\u2019ve taken. We\u2019re continuing to manage and evolve the company to further strengthen our competitive advantages, growing value through the transition, regardless of its pace. Turning now to some perspectives in 2021. As I said, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress advancing our strategy over the past year. We remained focused on safety and reliability, delivering a second consecutive year of outstanding performance. In emission reductions, we expect to meet our 2025 reduction plans four years early. That led us to set even more aggressive plans for 2030. The experience we gained developing reduction roadmaps for our assets gives us confidence for what we can ultimately achieve. This helped form the basis of our recently announced ambition to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations by 2050. Of course, a big part of our work in this area involved our Low Carbon Solutions business. As I mentioned, this new business has made exceptional progress building a large inventory of new business opportunities with a focus on carbon capture, hydrogen, and biofuels. Importantly, we\u2019re also addressing emissions by providing high-performance products that deliver solutions to help our customers reduce their emissions. Demand for these products was very strong in 2021, enabling 7% growth in our performance product volumes. This helped drive record annual earnings in our Chemical business. Strengthening our portfolio across all of our businesses continues to be a key part of our strategic focus to increase shareholder returns. To that end, we had more exploration success in Guyana with six discoveries in 2021 and two additional discoveries already this year. This has expanded the estimated recoverable resource on the Stabroek block to more than 10 billion oil-equivalent barrels and we\u2019re on schedule to start production this quarter at Liza Phase 2. In the Permian, we continued to drive improvements in drilling and completions, increasing average production by nearly 100,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to approximately 460,000. We started up the Corpus Christi Chemical facility under budget and ahead of schedule. And we\u2019ve continued to monetize non-core assets, generating more than $3 billion of cash proceeds from divestments during the year. Our actions are yielding strong results and, as I said, positioned us to benefit from demand recovery. We grew earnings to $23 billion and drove nearly $2 billion of structural efficiencies in 2021 on top of the $3 billion the year before. This puts us in a good position to significantly exceed our goal of $6 billion of structural cost savings per year by 2023 relative to 2019. We maintained our disciplined approach to investments, focused on competitively advantaged low cost of supply opportunities and on growing our portfolio of high-value products. CapEx was $16.6 billion for the year, which was near the low end of our guidance. As a result of our cost reductions, improved efficiency, and capital discipline, we\u2019ve lowered our Brent breakeven price to $41 per barrel. We\u2019re continuing to drive that down even more, expecting to average $35 per barrel between now and 2027. Cash flow from operating activities increased to $48 billion, the highest since 2012. We used the available cash to restore our balance sheet, essentially paying back what we borrowed in 2020, reducing our debt-to-capital ratio to about 21%. As a result of our restored financial strength, we increased the annual dividend for the 39th consecutive year and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that started last month. Overall, a strong list of accomplishments. Now looking ahead to this year. Our plan is robust and progresses our strategic objectives. I\u2019ll highlight a few key items on this page. First, we will increase our competitively advantaged, low cost of supply production with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 in Guyana and the Coral LNG development in Mozambique. The same is true for the Permian, where our focus remains on driving further capital efficiency and high-value growth. We\u2019re already ramping up manufacturing at Corpus Christi and expecting to start up our Baton Rouge polypropylene expansion later this year. These projects will continue to grow production of our high-value chemical performance products. We\u2019re applying the same capabilities and expertise developed over decades to progress our net zero ambitions and grow our low carbon solutions business. In that business, we expect to reach final investment decisions on large-scale carbon capture and storage projects at La Barge, Wyoming, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We\u2019re continuing to advance the flagship carbon capture opportunity in Houston. It now has 14 participating companies and has potential to capture up to 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2040. We also anticipate beginning to lift renewable diesel from our agreement with Global Clean Energy\u2019s biorefinery in California later this year, as well as making a final investment decision on our renewable diesel project at our Strathcona refinery in Canada, expanding our lower emissions fuels offering. And finally, we expect to further strengthen our balance sheet and progress our share repurchase program while continuing to retain capital flexibility and optionality to adapt to market conditions and opportunities. Leveraging our core competitive advantages, we\u2019re well positioned for future success, irrespective of the path or pace. We have the flexibility to shift resources between our traditional and low-carbon businesses at any rate required. This provides a lot of optionality and positions us to lead industry in the energy transition and in earnings and cash flow growth. We thank you for joining us today and look forward to sharing more with you during our Investor Day on March 2. Unfortunately, because of ongoing COVID considerations, we\u2019ll conduct the events virtually again this year. We do look forward to the day when we can get back to hosting you all in-person. Before we take your questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Stephen for his leadership and significant contributions. As after 30 years of service, he will be retiring at the end of this month. I wish Stephen and his wife, Kim, the very best. You\u2019ll be missed. I\u2019d also like to welcome Jennifer Driscoll, who will be joining later this month as our Vice President of Investor Relations. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Darren. Operator, please open the phone lines for the first question. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Hey good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Congrats, Stephen, on your retirement. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Phil. Phil Gresh : First question for Kathy on capital allocation, great to see the net debt reduction here in the fourth quarter, well ahead of our expectations and the start-up of share buybacks in January. As you look at 2022, with oil prices where they are, how are you thinking about the pace of the share buybacks and the desire to take leverage below this 20% to 25% target given the pace and progress you made in the fourth quarter? Kathy Mikells : Sure. So look, our capital allocation priorities remain the same, right? First, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re investing in the high-return assets and products across the business from Guyana to chemical performance products to biofuel. Second, really continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. I talked about on the third quarter, and we continue to look out to our term debt maturities with an eye to paying those down in 2022 and continuing to sustain the strong dividend that we have and then, obviously, returning further available cash to shareholders. We would have started the $10 billion share repurchase program at the beginning of the year, what I would have described as an equal pay against the 24-month longer-term time frame. As we assess both our year-end results, where we ended up in terms of net debt looking at the continued positive market environment, that would cause us to increase the pace of the share repurchase program. And as I stand here today, I\u2019d say increasing the pace with the faster end of that 12- to 24-month pace in mind. We will continue to evaluate the program and the pace throughout the year. It\u2019s one thing to sit here today and sit in what are pretty favorable market conditions, but we\u2019ll just have to see how the year pans out. But that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it right now. Phil Gresh : Okay. Great. No, that makes a lot of time. Thanks for that color. And then my second question, I know you\u2019ll give a more detailed update in March at the Analyst Day, but just any thoughts around 2022 production targets considering the \u2013 some of the recently closed asset sales, just any moving pieces, Permian or otherwise? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes. I\u2019ll take that, Phil. Good morning. As you know, one of the primary objectives we\u2019ve had in looking at the portfolio is less about volume and volume targets and more about the quality and profitability of the barrels that we\u2019re producing. So, we\u2019ve been aggressively trying to high-grade the portfolio across our businesses. And that\u2019s certainly true in the upstream, which led to the discussion we had a couple of years ago with respect to the divestment program, which continues to pay dividends and will continue to progress. And then the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Guyana and Permian and Brazil. And so I would expect that volumes are fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen this year. And \u2013 but the mix within that volume profile will continue to improve and the earnings per barrel will continue to improve, and that\u2019s been the focus. And as we move forward, we\u2019ll continue \u2013 you\u2019ll continue to see the \u2013 what I\u2019ll say, the quality of the barrels or profitability of the barrels increase. And then with time, as you head out in the later years, you\u2019ll see volumes grow with that improved quality mix. Phil Gresh : Okay. Great. That makes sense. Thanks a lot. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, there, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to reference some of your comments made on the structural cost reduction. You talked about those benefits continuing into 2023. I was just wondering if you could balance that, again, the cost inflation we\u2019re seeing across various items, your raw materials, logistics, labor, et cetera, can you talk about the net impact of those? And I have a follow-on on a different topic. Darren Woods : Sure. Good morning, Biraj. So we talked some time ago about a $6 billion structural reduction through 2023. As we work through 2021, and drove additional improvements within the business, we\u2019ve extended that restructural cost reduction. We expect, as I said this morning earlier, kind of around $2 billion again in 2022 and another $2 billion in 2023, so more than exceeding the level that we thought about and talked about last year. That obviously is the structural side of the equation in terms of reducing cost. The counterweight then is the inflation and Forex and some of the pressures that we\u2019re seeing. In the short-term, we were in the down cycle. We recognize that there would be a return and there would be growth, and that would put pressure on prices. And so we, in anticipation of that, tried to manage many of our contracts and the work that we are doing to maintain a level of cost and to minimize escalation as we headed into 2021 and into 2022, and that\u2019s paying off. We\u2019ve managed to mitigate quite a bit of that inflation. Obviously, as time goes on, we\u2019ll start to see more of that. And our expectation is the businesses will work to offset that inflation growth. And longer-term, our objective is, as we grow the business with the investments that we\u2019re making in Chemical business, Chemical facilities and some of the changes that we\u2019re making in our downstream operations, and then as we grow some of the upstream businesses, we\u2019ll offset all that increased cost with structural efficiencies. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay, understood. That\u2019s very helpful. The second question is actually asset specific. I\u2019ve been looking at some of the export data at Papua New Guinea over the last few months, and it looks like that asset is performing extremely well and above nameplate capacity. I was wondering if you could talk about whether there\u2019s anything specific you\u2019re doing to increase capacity there? And maybe any color on how much of those exports are contracted versus part would be helpful, too? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. I think, again, what we\u2019re seeing in Papua New Guinea, and frankly, it\u2019s been replicated in other parts of the company is what we\u2019ve been talking about, which is leveraging the full capabilities of the organization. One of the changes that we\u2019ve made over time here is we brought a lot of the optimization skills and techniques that we\u2019ve historically used in our downstream businesses, and our refineries where you\u2019re eking out pennies on the barrel to be successful. And taking that technology and approach to some of our upstream assets and sharing that technology and working with the upstream teams to improve the productivity of the assets on the ground, that\u2019s paying off really all around the world where we\u2019re applying that technique. And what you\u2019re seeing in Papua New Guinea is that\u2019s part of the driver \u2013 what the driver of that increase on top of just hard work by that operating team to maintain reliability and to run that plant to its constraints. And so I think it\u2019s the combination of those two things. And our expectation, we\u2019ve seen that in Chemical as well. As we brought those plants up, we\u2019ve been able to run above the nameplate capacity, just, again, with the optimization and the hard work of the operating team. So we\u2019ve kind of have an expectation as we bring new assets on that those operating teams figure out unique ways to get beyond constraints and improve the performance. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Thank you for taking my questions. First, I wanted to touch on the CapEx guidance, provided a range of $21 billion to $24 billion, which is appreciated. Can you just discuss how you think about what determines the low end and the high end of that range for this year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Kathy Mikells : Sure. So overall, I think as you consider the range that we\u2019ve given, I\u2019d kind of point to starting the year with an expectation of being more towards the center of the range, and then we\u2019ll see, ultimately, how the projects and the big projects proceed is probably the biggest indicator and whether any new projects ultimately come online, which we would always be maintaining some level of flexibility for. Unsurprisingly, with the size of our Upstream business relative to Downstream and Chemicals, the biggest increase year-over-year comes from overall, the Upstream business and further spending in Guyana, further spending in unconventional, especially the Permian, beginning to up-weight our spending overall on our own emission reductions. And again, the Permian would be another place that we\u2019re particularly focused, restarting paused projects that we had in the Downstream and then you\u2019ll be well aware of the big projects that we have ongoing in Chemicals. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the difference. And I\u2019d say how we think about landing towards the middle versus a different end within that range. But obviously, tightening the range relative to the range that we\u2019ve given over a longer period of time, which is the $20 billion to $25 billion. Jason Gabelman : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And my second question, I wanted to touch on the performance products within Chem. You\u2019ve often discussed that\u2019s a driver of your earnings growth over the next few years and high grading the business. And so I just wanted to hopefully get some context around the comment about 7% growth in Performance Products volumes, can you help us understand what types of earnings uplift that provides, and how you think about earnings growth within that Performance Products business moving forward? Kathy Mikells : Yes. So I\u2019d go back to the corporate plan disclosures we had where we talked about both within Chem and within Downstream, our focus on growing high-value, higher-margin projects, which would include low-emission fuels, and it would include high-performance lubricants in our lubricants portfolio as well as what we would describe as Chemical performance products and looking to double the volume of those products kind of over the planned period. And ultimately, as we look at the combination of Downstream and Chem over that period of time, looking to triple earnings and so it is a strong component of what sits behind tripling earnings, but I\u2019d also say, and this comes through our breakeven analysis, continuing to reduce the structural costs within the business across all elements of the business also are a driver of that increased cash flow and earnings power. So that\u2019s how I would think about how we\u2019re looking to continue to upgrade the mix within both Downstream and Chemical. Darren Woods : And maybe just a little bit of color commentary with respect to when we talk about performance, say, in the chemical company, what drives that and it\u2019s built on a pretty fundamental competitive advantage with respect to our technology capabilities and the work that we do with catalyst. And the developments that we\u2019ve made give many of our chemical products unique characteristics, characteristics in use. So that\u2019s a really important part of the value equation. And then we have invested in the science and technology to work with customers on applications to take advantage of those unique properties. And we have labs in China and other places around the world to support our customers. And the value and use of that improved performance then is shared with customers and ourselves, which gives that uplift on our performance products. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Thanks for the answer. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Well, thanks good morning. Shocking news this morning, congratulations, Stephen, we will miss you indeed. I look forward to chatting with you before you leave. So guys, I wonder if I could go to Slide 12 and just ask you to walk through a little bit more color on the breakeven guidance that you\u2019re talking about. And my specific question is, you\u2019re talking about an average breakeven between $22 billion and $27 billion, but a lot of your higher-margin projects come on at the back end of that period, specifically Guyana. So what does the breakeven look like at the end of the period as opposed to the average? Kathy Mikells : So you\u2019re probably asking questions that I\u2019ll dive into a bit more detail when we get to Investor Day, Doug, but you\u2019re right. What we walked through on this slide and specifically on the bottom of the slide, where we did the walk from our current breakeven to that average in $22 billion to $27 billion of $35 billion. What I would tell you is, as a result of the comment with regard to the portfolio improvement, continuing to take place over time. As you would expect, we start out at the higher end and then move to the lower end. So I would tell you our progress, while not exactly linear, continues to be fairly consistent over that period of time. And we\u2019ll definitely dive into that a bit further when we get to Investor Day. Darren Woods : And I\u2019d add Doug, that the high end of that range is consistent with what we\u2019re showing in 2021. Doug Leggate : Okay. So it\u2019s probably below 35% as the bottom line at the end of the period. Arithmetically, would have to be, right? Okay. Alright, thank you. My follow-up is actually \u2013 I guess, it\u2019s a kind of a cash distribution question. A $0.01 dividend increase you basically did what Chevron did five-years ago. But they didn\u2019t have the growth story. The free cash trajectory that we see is pretty significant this year beyond what you\u2019ve laid out even with the buyback. So my question is, could we ever see Exxon do like an interim dividend increase? Or put differently, what are you going to do with all the cash? Kathy Mikells : I guess; a, I\u2019m not going to get out in front of the Board\u2019s decision with regard to further distributions to shareholders. We\u2019ve talked previously as we\u2019ve looked at our dividend that some of the metrics that we look at is both our dividend yield relative to our peers\u2019 dividend yield relative to, I\u2019ll call it, the total dividend yield on average on the market as well as looking at our payout ratio, our overall dividend size is larger than what our peers would be, and we have been more towards the top end of the range, both on yield as well as on payout ratio. Obviously, as we see the improved overall results at the company, that naturally is starting to impact both of those metrics, which we\u2019ll consider \u2013 continue to be considered as the Board looks to make decisions going forward. But I\u2019d say, as we sit here today, we continue to feel pretty good about what our dividend yield is and its competitiveness. Darren Woods : Yes. And I would add, Doug, that the Board evaluates that quarterly. So it\u2019s an ongoing discussion. We don\u2019t have a fixed time period. It\u2019s a function of the things that Kathy talked about. Doug Leggate : Alright, thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and Stephen, congrats on the retirement. Stephen Littleton : Thank you, Devin. Devin McDermott : So my first question is on some of the structural cost efficiencies. You\u2019ve all done a great job in bringing this to fruition here over the last few years and are still talking about exceeding the $6 billion structural target by 2023. I can\u2019t help to notice that in the waterfall chart on longer-term breakevens, you\u2019re showing an incremental $5 billion of cost reductions relative to 2021 levels, you\u2019d imply pretty significant increase in that longer-term target. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the incremental opportunities that you identified? And I\u2019d imagine that some of the structural changes at the corporate level that you\u2019ve announced recently are part of that? Darren Woods : Sure. And just to be clear on the chart that Kathy walked folks through the five, that we\u2019re showing on that bottom chart is dollars per barrel, it\u2019s not billions of dollars. So be clear on that. Devin McDermott : Understood. Darren Woods : And so I think the heart of the reductions that you\u2019re seeing as we go forward is a function of capturing the best of what the corporation can bring to bear in each one of our businesses. Just a little bit of background, Devin. We started with process safety and basically, several years ago, launched an effort to take the best thinking that we had in each of our businesses, bring that together, come up with one approach to managing process safety and then roll that out across the organization. That has resulted in eliminating a lot of duplicate or programs running in parallel that brings cost. So we\u2019ve saved with respect to the work that we are doing in that space. But much, much more importantly, we improved our results and have significantly reduced process safety events. And so we\u2019re continuing down that path. But it highlighted the strength of kind of capturing the learnings that have occurred across our different businesses over the decades. And the quality thinking that we have in each of our organizations and bringing those experts together and having them address the problem on a corporate-wide basis is delivering good results. We saw the same thing with reliability when we brought, again, the best thinking of the corporation across the different operating companies together to solve the challenge of how do we improve reliability structurally and sustainably across all of our businesses. This team came up with ideas and implementations that, once again, significantly lowered our cost, and is improving our performance. And so that is the kind of the recipe that we\u2019re executing across a very wide range of opportunities. We\u2019re bringing the maintenance activities and thinking about the above-site maintenance, how you \u2013 what are the price processes, how do you go about that into that same type of approach, leveraging the best of the corporation, which we expect to see significant improvements in our maintenance and turnaround spend. Technology and engineering that the new company or the new group that we\u2019re forming is basically, again, doing the same thing, best capabilities from each of our businesses. We have technology functions within each of our companies. We\u2019re bringing those things together, same with engineering. And we, again, expect to end up doing things much more cost efficiently for much more effect. And that \u2013 so the savings that we see going forward are really the result of a lot of different things being applied across a huge scale of our operations to significantly reduce cost. And there are other opportunities in the future. Think about supply chain, think about some of the financial transactions as we\u2019ve, over the course of 2018 and 2019, realigned our businesses and work processes so that now, as you look across our different businesses, we\u2019re conducting businesses in a very similar back office approach, so to speak, that gives us an opportunity to capture the synergies that exist between those. So a really broad range of opportunities as we kind of open the doors between the different businesses across our corporation, take the best that each has to offer, bring those together and come up with an answer that\u2019s better than anyone on its own. And I think that, again, plays to this the competitive advantages that I\u2019ve been talking about since taking this job around leveraging our scale, leveraging the integration of our businesses, leveraging the functional excellence that each of these companies have developed, how do we better take advantage of that, and then leveraging our technology and bringing that all together by leveraging the capabilities of our people. So that recipe is beginning to pay off. And frankly, hard to see where we \u2013 where that ends with respect to the improvements that we\u2019ve got lined up for the business. Devin McDermott : Very helpful. Thank you. And my second question is on M&A. In addition to the high return investment opportunity you highlight selective M&A as an opportunity in the slide deck. I was just wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail about what strategically you\u2019d be looking for at this point in time? Darren Woods : I\u2019ll answer that, and then if Kathy has anything to add, I\u2019ll turn it over to her. But as we\u2019ve talked about for quite some time, we do have an ongoing active M&A group that \u2013 but we look for things that \u2013 where we can and bring it into our portfolio add unique value, grow unique value. So it\u2019s got to be something that \u2013 where we feel like there\u2019s a synergy or a fit with what we\u2019re currently doing to lever that value up and see accretion very early on. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at that, and we look at it across all of our businesses for opportunities. And you\u2019ve seen that kind of play out in the Chemical business here with an acquisition last year. You\u2019ve seen it play out in our Downstream business. And so I think that\u2019s a very active program. But bottom line is, we\u2019ve got to look at what that opportunity looks like in the context of what ExxonMobil can bring to bear, then make sure that we\u2019re in a position to effectively leverage our core competencies, skill sets and capabilities to grow value beyond what either one companies could do independently. And that\u2019s how we assess and think about that. Kathy, anything to add? Kathy Mikells : The only other thing I\u2019d add is in the low-carbon emission space, we\u2019re also actively assessing things, and we would have discussed the fact that we made an investment in BioJet, I\u2019ll call it a biodiesel company, that\u2019s out in Norway where we also have an off-take agreement. So we continue to look at opportunities in that space as well. Devin McDermott : Thank you. Darren Woods : Welcome. Operator : Next question will be from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning, everybody, and congrats, Stephen. Thank you. So my first question is on the emissions statement that you made, where you\u2019re four years ahead of your target for 2025. It\u2019s interesting because the final data is not out yet, but I suspect that global emissions hit a record in 2021 just based on the amount of coal that came through the monthly supply numbers. And a lot of execution in the low carbon business is around policy and communicating to regulators what\u2019s most beneficial for society. So in the context of Exxon\u2019s emissions starting to fall and global emissions still rising, has \u2013 do you feel like your seat at the table has potentially improved or your influence is getting stronger? Or is it still very early in the process? Darren Woods : Well, I think \u2013 it\u2019s a great question, Sam. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, this is a really complicated space and it deals with a really important part of people\u2019s lives and the resiliency of the economies around the world. So I think I\u2019ve been encouraged frankly by the growth in terms of the folks who are working in this space and actively thinking through how best to achieve and address what we\u2019ve been talking about for some time to do a challenge. And I think there\u2019s a growing recognition and a growing acceptance of the need for a variety of solutions and approaches to strike that balance correctly and make sure that we make progress on lowering emissions. But at the same time, don\u2019t compromise the quality of people\u2019s lives. And I think what we\u2019re seeing play out today in Europe, certainly I think has made that point clear in terms of some of the challenges associated with moving quickly in this space or not thinking through all the potential downsides and unintended consequences. We\u2019ve seen that here in the U.S. with some of the tightness of supply. And so that is the challenge. We are committed to helping society make that reduction. We are working hard to catalyze the right kind of policy to incentivize and to drive emissions down faster, while at the same time protecting people\u2019s standard of living and livelihoods. There are options to do that. It does require some policy in different places, and we\u2019re seeing some of that policy manifest itself in some of the countries around the world, which underpins the work that we\u2019re doing in low carbon solutions. And that\u2019s a global business with opportunities that we see developing all around the planet and many, many countries and there\u2019s policy in place today to support those investments, which is what\u2019s driving certainly in the early days. And then that, I think those policies and investments set good examples for other countries to consider and to think about in line with the needs of their constituencies. So I am encouraged. I do feel like there\u2019s a better conversation happening, obviously, a long ways to go there and lot of work to be done both from a policy standpoint as well as from the companies participating in the market. Sam Margolin : Thank you. And then so this is a follow-up about the low carbon solutions organization in the company. A lot of the efforts there are connected to existing operations, right, carbon capture on facilities or biofuels coming off of refinery parks. And so is the intent to fully disaggregate all of that from the base business so that we can kind of map the revenue trend line and associate that with an emissions abatement number and watch our progress that way? Or is that more of an organizational function and not necessarily a financial segment yet? Thank you. Kathy Mikells : So I\u2019d say, right now, our focus is on building that third-party business, right? We have, I\u2019d say, a huge number of projects in the pipeline. We feel very good about the progress that\u2019s been made in a pretty short period of time since we\u2019ve launched the low carbon submission business, but we also have the overall activities in terms of reducing our own emissions. And those activities are really the prime accountability of the business lines. And so there\u2019s an overall, I\u2019ll call it, corporate coordination, best practice role that\u2019s taking place there. That\u2019s part of what enabled us to actually expect to meet the 2025 goals ahead of time. So when we talk about our overall efforts as it relates to emissions in their entirety, we\u2019re always talking about what we\u2019re doing within our own four walls and then what we\u2019re doing to help reduce, I\u2019ll call it, our customers\u2019 emissions, or more broadly, what the company does in terms of the products and technologies that it offers in helping to reduce society\u2019s emissions with lower life cycle emission type product. So that\u2019s how we think about it. And certainly, first and foremost, that third-party business is something we\u2019re focused on building today. So we are not expecting that, that\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ll call it, new segment that we\u2019re disclosing as opposed to just focusing on building that business, which is still in its early stages. Darren Woods : But you can imagine, if you think about looking across more in our global portfolio and then opportunities with customers or third parties is understanding what\u2019s the lowest cost of abatement? How much CO2 can you reduce for the lowest dollar spent? That group has a good perspective that we\u2019re leveraging across all the opportunities, whether they\u2019re internal or external. And frankly, if you look at the portfolio of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at as a company, there\u2019s a really good mix between what we\u2019re going to be doing at our own facilities, opportunities to provide lower emissions products for our customers and then opportunities to reduce industry-wide CO2 emissions. So it\u2019s got a good mix today. We\u2019re very early in this process. I mean, this is a very dynamic space. If you think back a couple of years ago, hydrogen and carbon capture and frankly, even biofuels were struggling to kind of be in the mix in terms of potential solutions. Whereas, today, I think people recognize the importance they\u2019re going to play going forward. And so I would just say it\u2019s rapidly evolving. There\u2019s a lot of interest. We\u2019ve certainly had a lot of interest expressed in our business and the opportunities we\u2019re pursuing. So I would say, we\u2019ll keep talking about that. You\u2019ll see that business grow with time as places around the world take the steps to make the necessary reductions. Sam Margolin : Thanks. By the way it\u2019s Lunar New Year, and it\u2019s the Year of the Tiger. So that seems potentially significant. So thank you. Darren Woods : I am glad to hear that. Sam Margolin : Have a good one. Darren Woods : You too. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Hey, good morning team and congrats on strong results and congrats to you, Stephen, on your retirement here. A couple of questions for you. The first is on the Permian. Darren, can you just provide an update on how you\u2019re thinking about prosecuting that asset? We heard from Chevron. They\u2019re thinking about 10% type of growth in the Permian in 2022 versus 2021, how are you thinking about volume growth? And then in general, what is the right approach to maximizing value from the Permian relative to what you were talking about a couple of years ago? Darren Woods : Yes. Sure, Neil. I think maybe I\u2019ll start with where you ended, which is what we were talking about a couple of years ago, which you recall, we talked about, I think the terms I used where right now, the industry is playing a short game, and we\u2019re a long ball hitter. And how do you do \u2013 how do you take the long ball game into the unconventional space? And that led to the approach that Neil Chapman has talked about over the last couple of years with respect to setting up more of a manufacturing approach and driving efficiencies and driving technology applications into that \u2013 those developments. And that has worked very, very well. And we\u2019re seeing the results of that. So we grew our Permian production from 2020 to 2021 by over 25%. Our expectation as we go into 2022 is to grow another 25%, and that\u2019s doing that with a very tight control on capital. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re playing the game, and we continue to look at within our \u2013 the approach that we outlined a couple of years ago, and the success that we\u2019ve seen with that and bringing to bear a lot of the technology and application expertise, I think drilling and reservoir management that the rest of the corporation has really seeing the benefits of that. We\u2019re going to make sure that we stay in that envelope. And obviously, as we progress production and development, new horizons are opening up, and we\u2019ve got more delineation work to do that will continue to kind of grow the understanding of where the opportunities are. And we\u2019ll progress those in the context of staying within that concept that we\u2019ve laid out, which we\u2019re seeing allows us to bring barrels to market at a very low cost. And that\u2019s going to be an important part of the equation, maintaining that low-cost, high-value operation. Neil Mehta : Do you have a number in mind from a volume perspective as you think about this year? Darren Woods : So this year, I think we\u2019re going to be 25% up. We expect to be 25% up from 2021, which is consistent with how \u2013 the increase that we saw from 2020 to 2021. Neil Mehta : Okay. Very helpful. And then I really like this exhibit \u2013 or Page 12 of the slide with the breakevens. And I know we spent a lot of time on it already on the cost and the volume side, but the big number here is mix, the $9 a barrel. Can you spend some time talking about the composition of it? How much of it is Upstream versus Fuel versus Chemicals? And any more granularity that we can expect at the Analyst Day to help us break down the mix shift that you\u2019re seeing in the business? Kathy Mikells : Sure. So look, overall, the business composition, by its nature, is heavy Upstream relative to Downstream and Chem. So as you think about that mix, all of the businesses are contributing to the favorable mix. Upstream has an outsized contribution. We talked about in our strategic plan that 70% of those investments were in, I\u2019ll call it, the strategic Upstream development area, so Guyana, Permian, Brazil, bringing on more LNG, those are really what are fueling, I would call, the Upstream improvement in the portfolio. And then we also talked about, by the time we get to 2027 in Downstream and Chem over 40% of the earnings coming from those high-value, high-performance products. So you do get a mixture, overall, but obviously, a very big change overall in the portfolio coming from the Upstream. And, overall, that\u2019s what the big drivers are. We\u2019ve talked about 50% of our volume from post-2020 start-ups in 2027 from the Upstream. So just to give you another stat, in terms of how significant the mix change is there. Neil Mehta : Thanks Darren, Kathy. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi. Thank you. First, Stephen, thank you for the help and congratulations and wish you a wonderful retirement. And that two questions, please. I think, for Darren, you guys have just announced sort of a [indiscernible] restructuring. But historically that your Chemical, and we\u2019re finding is already wanting as maybe as coordinated as anyone, I mean 70%, I think, of your chemical facility linked to \u2013 directly to your refinery operation. And you\u2019re always in the management committee that have an executive sort of overseeing both chemical and refining. So with this structural change, are we talking about major headcount reduction? Is that the rationale behind? Or how exactly the topic realignment really changing the way how \u2013 what consider probably really seamless and one of the best in the industry in coordinating between Chemical and Refining? I mean, how is that really going to change that port and further improve? And let me after that, then I will ask the second question. Darren Woods : Okay. Yes. So I think a good observation, and I would echo the points you made, which is, if you look at our Chemical and Downstream business. Historically, they have been very well coordinated, I think, amongst the best within the industry. I would say, though, there\u2019s a difference between coordinating between two owners and then having a single owner. And \u2013 we really see the opportunity as \u2013 to have one set of management overlooking those businesses and making sure that we\u2019re prioritizing across those businesses and those resources, making sure that we\u2019re prioritizing not only the investments that we\u2019re making in the facilities, but the allocation of the resources, our technical resources, our engineering resources and pursuing the highest priority payout opportunities across those two. And it\u2019s difficult to do today across two separate organizations. This will improve upon that. So we\u2019ve got a good base case. We think we\u2019re going to make this even better. And we\u2019ve demonstrated the power of that to ourselves, frankly, in a couple of previous organizational changes. I\u2019ll just take the Upstream business, when you think about the functional companies that we had in our Upstream business, many of them, working very closely together and coordinating. We\u2019ve then consolidated all those businesses from \u2013 from seven, three, two and now down to one. As we step through each of those, despite what I would say is the best intention of the organizations and working collaboratively together, you get a step change in performance and opportunity to reduce cost and becoming more efficient as you consolidate those. And so we\u2019re going to see, we believe, the same opportunity within the Downstream in the Chemical portfolio. The other point I would make, which I don\u2019t want to go unrecognized is by taking and centralizing what I will call a service delivery processes out of those businesses and, again, bringing the best corporation has to offer and then high grading the thinking there, as I talked about with process, safety and reliability, doing that in maintenance, we think is going to drive a step change improvement with respect to how we execute maintenance across the entire portfolio. So there\u2019s this opportunity to consolidate expertise and then leverage that across all of our operating companies. And so those two things, I think, are going to be very, very critical. And the third point I would make with respect to headcount reductions, that\u2019s not what we see driving this improvement opportunity. We made those tough decisions back in 2020. We recognized how hard that was going to be on the organization. And we stretched ourselves to make sure that when we put together our plans for that, we as best as possible, comprehended what was to come and made this a onetime deal as much as we can, and therefore stretch ourselves to then move the organization to the level of efficiency that we need to support a lower staffing. And that\u2019s the work that we\u2019ve been doing. And then obviously, as attrition has occurred within our company and the industry more broadly and across the economy as a whole, we\u2019ve been very thoughtful and cautious about what positions we fill and how we manage that attrition, again, continuing to think through opportunities to get more efficient and take advantage of the attrition to make sure that we\u2019re managing our staffing in line with what we see as the ultimate opportunity. When you put all that together, we feel like we\u2019re in a fairly good position to execute this and not have the kind of one-off large redundancy programs that we went through in 2020. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. And the second question maybe is for Kathy, that at 20%, 21% debt-to-capital at a $90 oil price, obviously, is extremely comfortable and one will argue that maybe it\u2019s low lease, but the volatility in the market is unpredictable. So from that standpoint, given you are generating a lot of free cash, should we continue to put a portion of that into the balance sheet, into the cash until you reach maybe in also conservative such as zero net debt? That \u2013 I mean if you look at in 2020, if you have a zero net debt entering into the downturn, that tremendous opportunity, whether it\u2019s from buyback or other things that you can do. So is that a reasonable approach for a business as unpredictable and volatile as oil and gas? Or do you think that\u2019s just building not the efficient use of capital structure? And on the side, if quickly, if I can sneak in is, can you talk about your U.S. cash tax payment position over the next several years? Thank you. Kathy Mikells : Okay. So overall, we would absolutely agree that during the best part of the cycle, we need to be really restoring our balance sheet and giving ourselves plenty of flexibility to contemplate what\u2019s ultimately going to be the down part of the cycle, which is difficult to call. You would have heard me make commentary that we are going to further reduce our debt. We certainly think getting to the low end of, I\u2019ll call it, the total debt to cap range is something that we\u2019re absolutely targeting and expecting to achieve this year. And relative to where we\u2019ve been historically, I\u2019d say carrying a bit more cash is within the expectation as well. So I would say we\u2019re very aligned in understanding that during the top part of the cycle, we really want to make sure that we\u2019ve built in a whole lot of flexibility and completely restored our balance sheet, continue to have really strong credit ratings. We wouldn\u2019t, today, sit here and say, we think we need to have zero net debt or carry zero debt overall. And that does serve also as a little bit of an offset against inflationary pressure to some extent. So I\u2019d say we feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re getting the balance right in both ensuring we have a strong balance sheet and plenty of liquidity, and also then during this part of the cycle, making sure that we have a path forward to continue to have that flexibility and return excess cash within our capital allocation priorities to shareholders. Darren Woods : Yes. And I would add, Paul, I don\u2019t think you have to go too far back in time to just test how resilient the strategy that we had in place with respect to capital structure was. I mean 2020, in the pandemic, and we saw the worst conditions in this industry in living memory. And the fact that we managed through that extreme set of circumstances, maintained our commitment to our shareholders, continued to pay dividend, managed our capital program and basically kept all those projects that we were pursuing alive and slowed some of those down, paused and kept others going, that balance that we struck going through those extreme challenging times. I think demonstrated the robustness of the approach that we are pursuing. Kathy Mikells : And then I\u2019ll just come back to your second question. I\u2019d say, as we look forward in the near term, just the next few years out, we don\u2019t really see our U.S. cash kind of tax position changing, but that is with a big caveat that there\u2019s obviously been a lot coming forward in Congress with respect to potential tax changes. And while the bill back better bill did not kind of ultimately go through, I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s entirely off the table in terms of coming back and seeing something smaller, but likely to still have various tax provisions in it. But that\u2019s how you should think about it for the moment before we see any other legislative changes. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Stephen Littleton : Operator, we probably have time for one more caller. Operator : Okay. We\u2019ll take that last call will be Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Sneaking me and here at the end. I\u2019d like to ask, international gas was exceptionally strong. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to understand why, but I was curious as we look between LNG, domestic sales wherever those occurred, and then you talked about building up a trading organization. And I was curious if that was a positive contributor this quarter? Darren Woods : Sure. Well, I think the story around natural gas is pretty well understood with respect to the tightness that we\u2019re seeing. And the majority of our sales of gas are contracted under long-term contracts. And \u2013 so limited opportunities to make significant changes in the short term. I would say that we do have a very active trading program, and we continue to grow that. And our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to grow that. And so I think that\u2019s going to play a bigger role as we go forward. But I don\u2019t think as you look at today\u2019s results, it\u2019s \u2013 the value that you\u2019re seeing is basically being driven primarily by the base business. Roger Read : Okay. And then any changes in terms of your LNG outlook, particular projects? I know there\u2019s been talk of bidding on some things in Asia Pac market or East Asia, maybe I should say, in terms of new facilities. Just curious if there\u2019s been movement there? You talked a little earlier about the outlook with PNG. But whether it\u2019s Middle East, Asia or Gulf Coast, just curious in terms of expansion? Darren Woods : Yes. I would say there, nothing has changed per se. I think we have as, a fairly broad portfolio of opportunities that we\u2019ve been working and we continue to work those. And if we can find \u2013 those projects, which deliver the kind of returns at the cost of supply that we think is needed to compete over a very broad range of future scenarios that we\u2019ll pursue those. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. And I would just say the work that we\u2019re doing in that space today is consistent with the work we\u2019ve been doing for some time now. There are opportunities out there that we\u2019re evaluating, but they need to be competitive in the portfolio, and they need to be competitive long term across a very wide range of future scenarios. Kathy Mikells : And no change with the big projects that we\u2019re progressing. Obviously, we\u2019ve got the Mozambique Coral floating LNG projects, still expected start up towards the end of this year and continuing to progress the Golden Pass project. Roger Read : Great. Thank you and good luck, Stephen in your retirement. Stephen Littleton : Thank you very much Roger. I also like to thank all of you for your time and thoughtful questions this morning. I also like to thank you for the opportunity to work with you over the past couple of years and look forward to introducing you to Jennifer. So with that, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. And thank you and please stay safe. Darren Woods : Thanks, everybody. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest in ExxonMobil. Joining me today are Darren Woods, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The slides and our prerecorded remarks were made available on our Investors section of our website earlier this morning along with our news release. In a minute, Darren will provide opening comments and reference a few slides from that presentation, then we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. We expect to conclude the call by about 9 :30 a.m. Central Time. Let me encourage you to read our cautionary statement, which is on Slide 2. Please note, we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Now I'll turn the call over to Darren Woods. Darren Woods : Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As we laid out at our most recent Investor Day, our goal is to sustainably grow shareholder value through the execution of our strategic priorities seen on this slide. As we think about recent events, our job has never been clearer or more important. The need to meet society's evolving needs reliably and affordably is what consumers and businesses across the globe are demanding and what we delivered this quarter. First, we continue to build our competitively advantaged production portfolio, bringing new barrels to market today, driven in part by the high-value investments, we continue to progress through the pandemic-driven downturn in prices. A prime example of the benefits of our continued investments is Guyana. This quarter saw the successful start of the Liza Phase 2. Production is ramping up ahead of schedule and is expected to reach capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day by the third quarter of this year. Combined with Liza Phase 1, we will bring our total production capacity in Guyana to more than 340,000 barrels per day. Our third project Payara is running ahead of schedule with start-up now likely by year-end 2023. Yellowtail, the fourth and largest project to date on the Stabroek Block, received government approval of our development plan, is on schedule to start up in 2025. Further adding to our portfolio, we have made 5 new discoveries this year that have increased the estimated recoverable resources to nearly 11 billion oil equivalent barrels. Turning to the U.S., we continue to grow production in the Permian Basin. In March, we produced about 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, on pace to deliver a 25% increase versus 2021. Looking forward, we're also growing our globally diverse portfolio of low-cost capital-efficient LNG developments. In Mozambique, the 3.4 million ton per year Coral South Floating LNG production vessel is being commissioned after arriving on site in January. Coral South is on budget with the first LNG cargo expected in the fourth quarter. In addition to investing in high-value opportunities in our existing businesses, we are also advancing opportunities in our Low Carbon Solutions business. During the quarter, we announced plans to build a large-scale hydrogen plant in Baytown, Texas. We anticipate the facility will have the capacity to produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day. Combined with carbon capture, transport and storage of approximately 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year, this facility will be a foundational investment in the development of a Houston CCS hub, which will have the potential to eliminate 100 million metric tons of CO2 per year and represents a meaningful step forward in advancing accretive low-carbon solutions. We also reached a final investment decision to expand another important carbon capturing storage project at our helium plant in Wyoming. In addition, we received the top certification of our management of methane emissions at our Poker Lake development in the Permian. We're the first company to achieve this certification for natural gas production associated with oil. At the end of the first quarter, we implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage the scale and integration of the corporation, improve the effectiveness of our operations and better serve our customers. We combined our Downstream and Chemical operations into a single Product Solutions Business. This new integrated business will be focused on developing high-value products, improving portfolio value and leading in sustainability. As a result of these changes, our company is now organized along 3 primary businesses : Upstream, Product Solutions and Low Carbon Solutions. These 3 businesses are supported by corporate-wide organizations, including projects technology, engineering, operations, safety and sustainability. Before I cover our financial results, I want to provide a perspective on the market environment. In the first quarter, a tight supply/demand environment, primarily due to low investment levels during the pandemic contributed to rapid increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. Clearly, the events in Ukraine have added uncertainty to what was already a tight supply outlook. Brent rose by about $22 per barrel or 27% versus the fourth quarter. Today, natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges, driven by tight global market conditions and ongoing European supply concerns. The same tight supply to manufacturers have also pushed refining margins near the top of the range. Chemical margins in Asia have fallen sharply, with product prices lagging the steep increases in fees and energy cost. In our case, the U.S. ethane feed advantage provided a significant positive offset versus this global view. With that market environment as the backdrop, let me turn to our first quarter financials. Earnings totaled $8.8 billion, excluding an identified item, the after-tax charge associated with Sakhalin-1. As you know, we are discontinuing our Sakhalin-1 operations in Russia, which represented less than 2% of our total production last year, about 65,000 oil equivalent barrels per day and about 1% of our corporate operating earnings. As the operator, our priority continues to be the health and safety of our people and the protection of the environment. Of course, we remain in full compliance with all U.S. sanctions and are closely coordinating with the U.S. administration. Turning to structural savings. We continue to drive further efficiencies and now delivering more than $5 billion of annual savings versus 2019. CapEx totaled $4.9 billion for the quarter, in line with our full year guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $14.8 billion, maintaining our strong balance sheet. Our debt-to-capital ratio remains in the low end of our 20% to 25% target range while our net debt-to-capital ratio dropped to about 17%. We returned $5.8 billion to shareholders, of which about 2/3 was in the form of dividends and the remainder, share repurchases, consistent with our previous program. We said during our Corporate Plan Update in December that we expect to repurchase $10 billion of our shares. This morning, we announced an increase to the program, up to $30 billion in total through 2023. This move reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and the strength of our balance sheet. Before I leave you with a few key takeaways, let me share one other decision we made this month with respect to our workforce. Continually investing in our people and maintaining a strong culture are core strategic priorities and essential to achieving our long-term objectives. As part of that effort, we are tripling the number of employees eligible for stock grants by bringing in high-performing employees at earlier stages of their careers. Our goal is to increase our people's ownership in the company and importantly, in our financial and operating results. Secondly, in June, we will implement a 3% off-cycle compensation adjustment in the U.S. to maintain competitiveness. Our compensation and benefits programs are a key element of our total value proposition that enables us to continue to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. Let me leave you with a few key takeaways. We had a strong first quarter, and I'm proud of the organization's progress. The impact of weather on the Upstream volumes and derivatives and timing impacts in the Downstream obscured a strong underlying performance. We anticipate an absence of these impacts and strong refining margins will position us very well in the second quarter. We are making outstanding progress on our high-value growth developments in Guyana, the Permian and LNG. Our new Corpus Christi Chemical Complex is up and running ahead of schedule and generated positive earnings and cash flow in its first quarter of operations. We have strengthened the balance sheet and are creating value for shareholders through an attractive dividend and increased share repurchases. We are advancing hydrogen, biofuels and other low carbon solutions consistent with our intention to lead in the energy transition, leveraging our competitive advantages of scale, integration and technology. Finally, we are evolving our organization from a holding company to an operating company to better serve our customers' evolving needs and grow long-term shareholder value. Before we take your questions, I want to acknowledge the very real impact the high prices are having on families all around the world. You may recall that we anticipated this in 2020 with industry investment levels well below those required to offset depletion. That's why we work so hard to preserve our capital expenditures during the depths of the pandemic, ensure that additional production was available to meet the eventual recovery in demand. Today, that long-term focus is paying off with growing production of industry-advantaged supply. We are continuing to focus on the fundamentals through ongoing investment in advantaged projects and low emission initiatives to ensure that we can continue to meet the critical needs of people all around the world reliably and importantly, well into the future. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Darren. One last piece of housekeeping I wanted to mention is that ahead of the segment reporting change next quarter, we plan to provide you annual and quarterly information for the past 5 years using the new reporting segments to assist you with your modeling. We plan to post the new data on our website around mid-June. Also, please note that starting with this call, we ask our analysts to limit themselves to a single question, so that we can fit in questions from more people. However, you may remain on the line in case a clarification is needed.  And with that, operator, please provide the instructions and then open the phone lines for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from the line of Phil Gresh with JPMorgan. Phil Gresh : Good morning, Darren and Kathy. So I guess my question is a little bit of a 2-part question then. The buyback, $30 billion over 2 years. Previously, you talked about, I think, $10 billion mostly in 2022. So should we assume the $30 billion essentially ratable, $15 billion this year? And then if that's the case, it still seems like there's a lot of excess cash potentially building out at the strip prices. So how do you think about any excess cash, debt reduction, et cetera, given where the leverage is versus targets now? Kathy Mikells : Great. Thanks very much. So look, we don't know exactly how long the strong market conditions that we're seeing today are going to persist. And we learned some pretty tough liquidity lessons during the pandemic. So our cash balance has been building a bit. You would see that it was $11 billion as we ended the quarter. So you should expect with the backdrop of the strong market conditions that even with the higher buyback program that we announced this morning, we would be building our cash in the near term potentially between $20 billion to $30 billion over time. And so that really addresses our need for flexibility in what's an incredibly uncertain environment and ensuring that we'll continue to appropriately invest in the business and sustain the share repurchase program that we talked about through 2023. In terms of just how to think about the pace of the program, it's up to $30 billion through the end of 2023. We obviously got $2.1 billion done in this quarter. You should think about us looking to get up to a ratable pace. And that roughly, we'd be looking to get $15 billion done a year, again, looking to sustain the program kind of more consistently over this 2-year period. So that's how I would think about kind of roughly where we see our cash balance and just looking to maintain a lot of flexibility in what's a pretty uncertain environment. And we did learn some real lessons during the pandemic. We used to try and hold our cash balance, call it, between $3 billion and $5 billion and run a lot of commercial paper. And when the pandemic hit, that was quite problematic for the company. So we're going to be a little bit more conservative here in the near term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our question is related broadly to your global gas opportunities. Can you talk about how you see the evolution of the U.S. market? And how do you see certified gas playing a role in U.S. supply? And I guess, do you intend to really look for a global outlet for a portion of your U.S. gas? And we understand that Golden Pass provides a great opportunity to capture the spread, but maybe are you thinking about some other opportunities besides Golden Pass? Darren Woods : You're welcome, Jeanine. Good to hear from you again. Just maybe a broad comment on the LNG business. Obviously, as we're seeing across each of our sectors, the pandemic had a pretty profound effect with respect to deferring, delaying capital spend and, therefore, additional capacity coming on. And as the pandemic has subsided and demand has recovered, we're seeing very tight markets and seeing that play out really around the world, obviously, a significant impact. And then with the Ukraine and the situation there that has added a significant additional level of uncertainty around supply. And so I think a very dynamic market and a very high-priced market. And what we've seen in response to that is basically very full capacity utilization all around the world, maximizing the amount of LNG moving. Obviously, we've got our Coral LNG starting up later this year, which will help contribute and ease some of that tightness. And then you mentioned Golden Pass, which is an important leg of our strategy of making sure that we have access to LNG supplies that we can -- to supply demand all around the world, and that's a very important part of our strategy in LNG going forward is making sure that we've got barrels that we can then move and trade in the marketplace and move across the different regional demand centers. And so I think we're going to continue to look for opportunities in LNG. It's an important part of the portfolio. We've got opportunities in PNG that we're progressing obviously, additional investments on Mozambique are in the future as well. And so I think it will be a very important foundational layer of supply and a really important part of our overall business offering Kathy Mikells : And I would just add, you asked a little bit about that top rating that we got on methane management in Poker Lake in the Permian. And we would say we really see a market over time building for lower emission products, and that really plays into that. And we would certainly hope that we'd also start to see a premium on those lower emission products, right? And we'd say that's consistent across our business, but we definitely are looking to play into that going forward. Darren Woods : Yes. I would just add to that. Obviously, that would be a benefit, but it's certainly not the main driver with respect to making sure that our operations have very low emissions and very low methane emissions. And so that's a core part of our commitment in running these facilities. And to the extent the market pays a premium for that, that's an advantage that we'll look to take the advantage of. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : I wanted to ask about the structural cost reduction goals. You continue to make good progress there. But the question is, can you add a little bit of color around what you're seeing on just broad cost inflation, labor and otherwise? And how, if at all, that impacts some of those goals and targets over time? Kathy Mikells : Sure. So I'll start out with just saying, we feel good about the progress that we're continuing to make. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had said we've gotten to about $5 billion in structural cost savings relative to 2019. We're now at $5.4 billion. So I'd say, overall, we feel really good about that progress. Obviously, we have now put in place the new organizational structure, which should drive incremental efficiencies on top of just driving better operations, faster speed to market, better deployment, faster deployment of resources to the highest opportunities across the company. We're not immune to inflation, obviously, and we would see a fair amount of both energy and feedstock inflation coming through the business in certain areas that put a little bit of pressure on margins. Overall, in terms of how we're managing that, it flows through 2 parts of the operation. So one is on CapEx. We feel really good about where we're at there because during the pandemic, we really took the opportunity to extend contracts on work that was coming forward. So I'd say while the shorter cycle work programs obviously have some inflationary pressure, the teams are working really hard to offset that. Overall, I'd say we really try and lever master service agreement, self-manage kind of procurement. We utilize a diverse set of global contractors across the globe in trying to really manage inflation. So through the quarter right now, I'd say we're doing a pretty good job of offsetting it, but it's obviously something that we're watching really closely. Darren Woods : Yes, I would just emphasize the point that Kathy made, but I think one worth remembering, that this longer-term view that we took during the pandemic in trying to maintain a lot of investment, we also recognize that as economies recovered and demand picked up that we would potentially see inflation. And so we were very focused on -- in anticipation of that, trying to lock in some of the pricing and savings during all points that we could then take advantage of early on a recovery, which is considerably. And maybe the final point I would make is with the new organization, it's working hard and our leadership team is working hard to offset inflation and out of that, we think we've got a pretty good handle here, certainly in the short term. Obviously, we'll see how the market develops. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : I have -- a question we wanted to focus on was around Downstream. And Darren, you know the refining business really well given your leadership role there over the years. So I'd love you to kind of characterize how you're seeing the crack and refining market environment which is obviously extraordinarily strong. And then put that in the context of the quarter, which was softer in Downstream. But to your point, I think a lot of that was timing effects. And it feels like things should sequentially move in the right direction as you move into 2Q. So the big picture question around the refining macro, and then tie it into how you're thinking about the sequential move in your earnings power from here. Darren Woods : Sure. Neil, yes, I can start, and I feel like we're going to be a little bit of a broken record with respect to the anchoring a lot of what we're seeing in the market today across our sectors with the pandemic. And you'll recall, as we were going through that very deep down cycle, where demand for fuels products dropped significantly, there was a lot of refinery rationalization. In fact, the refineries were shutting down at a much, much higher rate than historical averages or tons, if not higher. And so you had a lot of capacity coming out of the marketplace. There were new facilities that were planned or in progress primarily in the Middle East and out in Asia. Those got deferred and delayed because of the occurrence. And so you've got, I think this period of time where you've taken a lot of capacity out and new capacity that was planned or in progress has been deferred and delayed. And so we've got a period with lower supply. And then, of course, this demand has picked up, that has led to this very tight market and the higher margins that we're seeing. What's compounded that then is the important role that Russia plays in supplying markets around the world. And with the uncertainty associated with that supply and potential impacts of additional sanctions that's put, I think, additional concern and anxiety in the marketplace, which is leading to a very high margin environment. One, frankly, that I don't think is a sustainable one; and two, good for economies around the world. So I think we're in a bit of a very tight time frame. And as you've talked about the first quarter, obviously, we saw that evolve over the first quarter with kind of rising margins in January, February, March and now into April, very high margins. And so I think that's something that we're going to see for quite some time, certainly here this year and into next, depending on obviously work how demand plays out. Final point I make, which you touched on is, you're right, this quarter reflects that ramp-up of margins. So you're not really seeing the healthy market that we're experiencing right now in the first quarter results, that will, I think, manifest itself in the second quarter. And then some of the timing impacts we expect to see unwind. Maybe I'll let Kathy just touch on those. Kathy Mikells : Sure. I'm happy to do that. And just to add a stat, our March refining margin was about $4 higher than the average in the quarter. So that's kind of reflecting that ramp-up that Darren just mentioned. And then obviously, in our prepared script, you would have seen us talk a fair amount to timing impacts that impacted profitability in Downstream for the quarter. I think everybody understands the mark-to-market on open derivatives, so I won't talk about that. But we had another $590 million of other timing differences. About $400 million of that was also tied to derivatives. We had $200 million that associated with cargoes where the derivatives actually closed in March, and then they reversed when the physical deliveries occurred in April. So I'd say the way you should think about that is we took a $200 million bad guy in March, and we will see a $200 million good guy in April. We also had $200 million associated with settled derivatives that we just used to ensure pricing of our refinery crude runs is ratable, right? The way you should think about that is it's kind of a wash over time. Sometimes, that pricing mechanism gives us a positive in a quarter, sometimes it gives us a negative in a quarter. Over time, it's just a wash. And then the last impact that we talked about was just commercial pricing lag, right? And the way I would think about that is we were in a steep rising price environment over the quarter. And so we had pricing that was a little bit lagging. If we're in a stable environment, that pricing will catch up. If pricing kind of turns to a downward curve, then we'd actually get a little bit of a benefit. So that's how I think about it as you're trying to model the evolution into the second quarter here. The bottom line is, obviously, we're carrying a lot of positive momentum as we stand here today. Operator : Next, we'll go to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Let me first of all thank the Investor Relations team for the better presentation of results. So thanks for that Jennifer. But I'm also -- we're losing a question here, so I'll tend for the enthusiasm, but I'm kidding. Thank you. So guys, my question, Darren and Kathy, is on your balance sheet. Darren, going back some years, I guess, a couple of years ago, you talked about don't expect Exxon to go back to the days of zero net debt. We're going to have a more efficient balance sheet. I just wonder if you can frame that for us today and what we should expect that to look like because, obviously, that speaks to go forward cash distributions, buybacks, cash on hand, the whole thing and obviously, dividend policy. So that was my question for today. Darren Woods : Yes. Thank you, Doug, and I appreciate your compliments to the IR team. I know they've been working hard to make sure that they're improving the transparency and information that you need to help understand what we're doing here and the business results that we're achieving. I think to your point on the balance sheet, and you remember what we started back in 2018 was this countercyclical approach where we lean on the balance sheet during the depths, made those investments with an eye on the fundamentals and expected recoveries and to take advantage of the ups with investments and facilities in the ground and then reinvest and lean into the down cycle. And I would tell you, generally speaking, that continues to be an ambition of ours and part of our strategy is to try to drive the countercyclical investment approach, which is -- has worked out very well for us and is paying off in today's market. But that's, I would say, 1 philosophy. Obviously, it is tempered by just the availability of cash and how deep and high the swings in this commodity cycle are. And so I think part of that balance sheet, and I want to toss it to Kathy here in a minute, let her make some comments on it, but part of that is just going to be a function of where you're at in the cycle and how severe that cycle is. And so there will be periods, I think, where you see some movement in both cash and how the balance sheet is structured. And based on where we're at and where the revenues are, and I would also tell you, though, that it's not what's not going to change is being very focused on making sure that any investment that we make is advantaged across the cycle. You'll recall my definition of disciplined investing is not an absolute level, but more of making sure that anywhere you spend money that you're convinced that you'll be the low-cost supplier with an advantage versus the rest of the industry, that will be successful as you move through the cycle. Kathy? Kathy Mikells : Yes. And then the only thing that I would add to that Doug is occasionally, I get the question of why don't you just go and kind of pay off all of the debt you have as a priority. And I'd say, we're really comfortable with the level of debt that we have. And obviously, our gross debt-to-cap is at the lower end of the range that we talked about. And we said we're going to carry a little bit of a higher cash balance just reflective of the volatility that we've really seen in the market. So that's how I think you should think about it. But we're very comfortable with our level of debt and just being able to kind of manage at that level through the cycle. Operator : Next, we'll go to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Another question on the Downstream, if I could, Darren. I wonder if I could ask on the circular polymer efforts and some of the things you're talking about in terms of recycling in the plastics business. There's, I guess, the question is the overall approach between mechanical and molecular recycling and how are you seeing that market evolve? And is this conversion of existing facilities or new reactors? And then also, what are your expectations for the returns in that business kind of through cycle? Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. Thank you, Stephen. I think you touched on, I think, a really important part of our strategy as we look at going forward, not only in the plastics and plastics recycling, but also in biofuels. And I think what people have thought about with respect to our refining footprint and the size of that footprint that as fuels, traditional fuels demand declines, if those assets become disadvantaged. And frankly, given the integration that we have with those facilities, if you think about our chemicals and refining facilities integrated, which are now reflected in our Product Solutions business, the fact that we've got base stocks and lubricant facilities integrated with those, they are fairly robust platforms with large scale and low cost. And what we see is the opportunity that as demand shifts to convert those facilities to produce more lower emissions fuels for biofuels and to utilize existing equipment for advanced recycling in plastics. And that's what you've seen us do in Baytown with conversion of some of our heavy cracking facilities on the refining side used to recycle waste plastic. And we've got pretty ambitious plans in that space. We like what we see there. It gives products that have all the same attributes as virgin products, but obviously, without the same -- with the ability to recycle the waste. And so we like the molecular recycling, that's where we're focusing. We think we can bring an advantage there with; one, our facilities; but two, our technology; and then three, with our marketing organization with respect to the marketing of those products.  So feel generally good about that. We've got plans to drive that recent advanced recycling to 500,000 metric tons by 2026, should have 30,000 metric tons in place by the end of this year. So I think, in total, we like what we see there. The market today is interested in those products and there is a premium out there. So right now, I think that looks pretty attractive. I suspect with time that may -- the market will stabilize, but we think it's going to be a pretty helpful market for some time to come. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jason Gabelman with Cowen Jason Gabelman : I wanted to ask a question about your international gas footprint and the maintenance cadence because it seems like you've mentioned in the slides that gas production is going to be higher than it typically is in 2Q and 3Q, but you do have higher scheduled maintenance. So I'm wondering if any of that maintenance is in the European gas footprint. And then more broadly, if you're seeing in the industry in Europe more tempered declines from European gas into the summer, just given where prices are? And if you expect that to be a feature of the market moving forward? Darren Woods : I think you've touched on the point that we made in our second quarter outlook with respect to the seasonality, which historically, we've seen going into the second quarter a significant drop in demand for gas. And given where the markets are at today and the level of inventories around the world, our expectation is we're not going to see the same level of demand change quarter-on-quarter, and we try to indicate that in our outlook to suggest that we will see the same level of seasonality going forward. I think, and as I said earlier with response to Jeanine's question, we do see this market being fairly tight here in the short term. Obviously, the industry is working hard to supply that, but it will -- the time cycle on investments and bringing additional supply on is fairly long, particularly in the context of where demand is at today and the tightness in the marketplace. So I think that's going to continue to be with us for a while. And as you move, as demand declines, I think we'll see supply start to move into inventory. And so that purchases will move from meeting current demand out in the marketplace to meeting the demand to fill inventory to make sure that inventories are well positioned as we move through the summer and then back into the fall and into the winter season that the markets are well supplied. And then the final point I would make there is obviously, with what's happening in Ukraine, there is a wildcard there that I think most economies and governments around the world are going to make sure that they're trying to mitigate the potential implications of that supply disruption by having good inventory levels. Operator : Next, we'll go to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : A question on -- actually, just a longer-term sort of capital allocation question in the context of what's become kind of conventional wisdom that NOCs around the world are very interested in accelerating activity here and bringing new resource to market. But the majority of NOCs, with the exception of a few, rely on foreign investment and partners like ExxonMobil in the industry, on the independent operator side has framed a stable spending view over the long term, which has been something that's been very helpful for investors to have that multiyear CapEx range. So I'm just wondering your perspective on how that squares if the industry is going to get pulled into the imperative of NOCs to spend more and do more or if you think these steady ranges of CapEx are achievable even within that context? Kathy Mikells : Sure. I'm happy to take that, Sam. So first of all, I would just remind you that we do have CapEx guidance that's out there, obviously, for this year, it's'21 to 24. And we've talked about kind of through 2027 range of 20 to 25. Now within that, we always try to leave ourselves a little bit of room understanding that there's these opportunities that can come up in the future. And obviously, we've made some investments in the type of opportunities that you're talking about in the past. And by the way, Golden Pass is a JV that we have with foreign investment that sits behind it as well. So I'd say we don't feel any particular pressure. I just reference back to what Darren said earlier, which is, we spend capital when we have confidence behind the projects and the returns that those projects are going to offer, right? And we're, I'd say, very, very disciplined at pressure testing those projects to make sure they're resilience across the, I'd say, wide set of market environment, given the cyclicality that we have in the business. So we feel great about the opportunities that stand in front of us right now. Obviously, we've got a low cost of supply barrels that we're investing in, be it Guyana or the Permian, Brazil. Darren mentioned the LNG projects that we're moving forward, which we feel really good about. Obviously, we've got in a Product Solution space, investments that we continue to make to support growth in high-value products, right, and to keep, I'd say, optimizing our Downstream circuit. So we feel good about that. If there's opportunities where we feel like there's a good return to be earned, we'll certainly look at potentially participating in those opportunities. But we're going to be very disciplined in our approach as you should expect from us. Darren Woods : Yes. And I would just add to that, Sam, if you look at the work we've been doing with our organization, the changes that we've made in the structure, the consolidation of capabilities across the corporation. One of the changes we announced on April 1 was a technology organization that combines the technical skills and capabilities and the engineering capabilities across the corporation. We've seen really good results doing that in the projects area. We think we've got a real opportunity in the technology area to realize similar benefits in terms of effectiveness on top of whatever efficiencies that might come from that work. And I would say that effectiveness in that concentration of technology and really getting the organization to focus on where we can add unique value and grow competitive advantage is going to be a really important part of continuing to be a valued partner with NOCs and others all around the world. Now our strategy here is to make sure that we're in a central partner that when NOCs and other resource holders are -- or want somebody who can effectively and efficiently develop the resource and doing in a sustainable manner that the first name to come to mind is ExxonMobil and then we bring those unique capabilities. And I would tell you, I have enormous confidence that that's what's going to happen. Things that we can see in the pipeline, the opportunities that we have in front of us to become more effective at what we do I think are huge and we're looking forward to then leveraging that business opportunities in the future. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : I had a question on Guyana. The fourth FPSO, which you just sanctioned was lodged on 250,000 barrels a day. I'm just wondering, in your base case plans, are you assuming a similar size for the later FPSOs at that rate? And if I could add a second question. A few days ago, there was an announcement from the DOE around additional export capacity from Golden Pass. I was wondering if you could just help me understand whether that was just an administrative thing, whether that was you sort of relooking at the project? Or is it some kind of future pricing ahead of debottlenecking there? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. On Guyana, Biraj, I would tell you that, as you know, we are having tremendous success with respect to discoveries there and the characterization of that resource. And I would just say that our teams have been very focused on making sure we have a good characterization of that resource, which will then be a really important part of how we choose to develop that resource in a cost-effective way to make sure that the cost of supply and obviously, the returns for those projects lead industry. And so as we look at that, these bigger production facilities make a lot of sense when you have the resource to support and because it brings your unit cost down, brings down your cost of supply. As we look at extending those developments in other areas of the resource base, it will be a function of what we find, but I would say we would lean towards these larger developments, and we'll obviously lean towards extending some of the current developments that we have and taking advantage of whatever synergies we might have with those facilities. And so I wouldn't say there's a single recipe here. It's really tailoring the recipe to make sure that it's optimized for the development opportunities that we've got in front of us. And that's going to evolve as we better characterize the resource base. And I will just say, with respect to Golden Pass, that project and the work that we're doing there, we feel good about the progress that we're making, and we're on schedule. The concept there is not changing. Operator : Next, we'll go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Maybe to come back a little bit to the Guyana question, and I was -- wanted to clarify 1 thing there. And then maybe just sort of a contrast to your Permian operations given Permian production is higher today, but Guyana resource is probably larger. As we think about the 11 billion barrels of resource, is that -- should we assume that's exclusively oil at this point? I mean that's been kind of our baseline given the type of production coming out. And then how should we think about the long-term gas situation there, the opportunity? And when I said versus the Permian, kind of thinking about those 2 as we look to the middle and latter part of the decade. Darren Woods : Yes. Good morning, Roger. I would say the resource is a mix and depending on where you're at within the Stabroek Block, that mix changes. Our development priorities is weighted towards liquid. So I think what you'll see in our plans and the way we talk about it is there's a bias towards liquid today. And then with time, we'll see how those developments evolve. We're doing some things with the government of Guyana to bring gas onshore to help deliver more cost efficient and environmentally better. Power to the people of Guyana and give them a much lower cost energy source and a much cleaner energy source. And so there is some development gas in that space. So -- but I would say, generally, liquids weighted in obviously, as we move through the field and run the economics, we'll develop the resources that optimize capital and grow returns. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe one on capital allocation. As we think about your capital budget, it's not just for this year but over the next few years and the range that you have within those budgets, is that -- should we think about that range is primarily driven by timing? Or should we -- is there a possibility that higher commodity prices -- should we think about maybe pushing towards the higher end of the range through some combination of inflation? Or are there opportunities in the portfolio to deploy a little additional organic capital, whether it's on short or mid-cycle infill drilling, tieback opportunities. Does the higher commodity price open up the door to a little extra capital deployment opportunity there? Darren Woods : Yes. I'll just start off, and then pass it to Kathy for any additional comments, but I would -- I think the short answer is no. I think we have tried to emphasize looking through the cycles, looking at the long term and making sure that the investments that we make are robust to the whole of the cycle. You remember, we were investing pretty heavily when prices were down in anticipation of longer-term fundamentals. I would say while we're in a very tight market today, we're not going to let that distract us from our focus of making sure that we have low cost of supply, industry-leading advantaged projects. And so that remains the focus. In the short-cycle stuff, I think to the extent that we stay within our credibly advantaged approach and the manufacturing processes that we've set in and the boundaries that we set with respect to the facilities that we've built, we pre-invested in and we'll continue to optimize around that, but we're not going to go outside of that broader strategy of the long ball game that we're playing in the Permian, in the interventional space. Kathy Mikells : Yes. And I would say, certainly, timing over what's a relatively long-term period is something that we're trying to give a little flexibility for. I'd actually point to what we talked about on the Payara Guyana project. Originally, we said that was going to start up in 2024, and now we're saying we think it's likely it will start up at the end of 2023. So that would be an example of, we have initial planning that we do, but obviously, accelerating projects if we can bring them in, in a shorter time frame. And obviously, on or under budget is something we're always focused on. Operator : Next, we'll go to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : First, hopefully, that also won't use my quota, yet I want to complement IR for the new format on the call as well as the increased disclosure, really appreciate. I have to apologize first because I want to go back into the inflation question. Kathy, on -- if we're looking out for your next several years, do you have a number you can share what percent of your CapEx is pretty much that had some pretty fixed pricing? And what percent is going to be subject to the inflation factor? And also in your presentation, you talked about the 3% off-cycle compensation adjustment. Could you quantify that how big is that number for us? Kathy Mikells : Sure. So overall, I think we talked a little bit about inflation on CapEx and the fact that certainly in the near term, we're feeling pretty good because we did a lot of work during the pandemic. So we had caused some projects. And during the pandemic, we did a lot of work to actually put the contracts in place like finish the engineering and put the contracts in place at a point where I'd say there was some deflationary pressures in the market. So as it relates to our overall capital projects, we feel pretty good over the next couple of years. And obviously, strategically, the timing of when we do the engineering, when we go out to procurement, is something that we're always looking at and taking into consideration. And then I mentioned the fact that doing our own procurement globally to make sure that we're getting globally competitive bids is something else we do. We do spend a lot of money over the years as we're looking forward on the boats associated with Guyana development. And again, we approach that in a really strategic manner, so that we're managing those projects to the lowest cost, getting the specific design that we need. So that's how I would really discuss what's happening with regard to inflation. Darren Woods : Yes. I would just add that the action that we announced this morning we're taking won't be material in the analysis that you're doing, Paul. Our intention would be to continue to deliver on the efficiency, I mean that's a -- that we had projected in our plan. Operator : Next, we'll go to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse. Manav Gupta : My very quick question here is, at the start of the call, you indicated that Asian Chemical margins are kind of below mid-cycle. And I just want to understand, generally, when crude moves up, there is support for commodity prices. So there's 2 equations going on here, some capacity coming on, but crude is also moving up. So do you expect the margins to remain below mid-cycle for some time? Or do you think that higher crude could actually push up the ethylene margins and stuff in the non-U.S. region on a go-forward basis? Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. I think it's an unusual time we've got in the chemical market just because we see a level of dislocation between what's happening in Asia and what we see happening in the Atlantic Basin. I think we made reference in the comments that our North America footprint in Chemical and the ethane advantage that we have has actually helped mitigate this broader downturn that we're seeing with the global chemical markets, which are heavily weighted to -- or weighted towards the downturn that we're seeing in Asia. And I think as you look at crude prices coming up and the marginal supply in olefins being a liquid cracker and naphtha feed that as that crude price goes up here, feed goes up and naphtha feed goes up. And so you've got cost increases on your feed. And because of some of the logistics constraints and the ability to kind of connect the market's demand is somewhat dislocated and so you've got oversupply in a market like China where you see some of the demand coming off lockdown and the logistics constraints. So I think you've got -- we're in a unique period right now where you're seeing some regional imbalances and inability to close those imbalances through logistics and transportation. We'll see how long it's going to last. But I think ultimately, as markets open up, we'll see those equilibrate with -- again, I think if crude remains high, my suspicion is that ethane and ethane cracking will continue to be advantaged. And then that will obviously move as crude prices move with respect to gas prices. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Herrmann with Exane. Lucas Herrmann : I just wanted to return to Golden Pass, if I might, and a couple of aspects of the question. The first is just can you expand on the marketing approach? How you intend placing volume? It's a very large project but it's a project which, to the best of my knowledge, has very little by way of contract at this time. So to what extent yourself and your partner QP will -- how you'll be looking to market products? And just can you give us some indication on the phasing of the start-up of the 3 trains? I presume when you talk about 2024 startup, that's the first train. I guess I'd expect 4 to 6 months-or-so between the start-up of each subsequent train, but any guidance you can give there would be helpful. Darren Woods : Sure. Lucas, just to start on the back end of your question, you're right, train 1 is -- we expect to start up in 2024 and then the remaining trains in 2025. And what -- the strategic drive behind that investment and that supply point was really getting a global -- a balanced global footprint with respect to LNG supply. So that Golden Pass facility gives us an anchor point within the Americas to take advantage of the U.S. gas market and the developments that we've seen there and the supply potential that we see in U.S. gas. And so that forms a really important anchor supply point. And we intend to use that with the trading business that we're growing in LNG and use it as an ability to trade and oftentimes bridge as some of our other LNG projects are being developed to bridge and supply between those projects that allow us to optimize and make commitments for projects with flexibility in terms of using Golden Pass as a supply point and then to also just trade in the spot market. So I think it's going to give us a lot of flexibility to supplement our longer-term contracts for our bigger projects, but to also participate in the spot market. Lucas Herrmann : So there's no intent to contract some of the volume in what could be a very constructive market for pricing over the next 2, 3 years for those who have supply coming on this near term? Darren Woods : I would tell you that the LNG organization is going to basically develop that portfolio in the way that they think maximizes the value of it. So I wouldn't take anything off the table. I'm just -- I'm suggesting that it's -- we've got a lot of optionality and flexibility and the expectation is the LNG business and the individual running that take advantage of that flexibility to maximize the value, that's how I would characterize it. Operator : And it looks like we have time for 1 more question, so we'll take that from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Thank you for squeezing me in and my question is on the Permian. Just wondering, I'm trying to assume you all running somewhere around 16 rigs and 5 spreads. I'm just wondering, will this continue to be around the level of activity needed in order to achieve that, I think, your goal around that 25% year-over-year Permian growth plans? And I was just also wondering if you could talk about maybe just broadly, the degree of inflation you just currently seeing there? Darren Woods : Yes. I would tell you that the plan that we had, and we've talked about with respect to the Permian, specifically somewhere between 10 and 12 rigs and then frac crew, something like that. And we're basically, I think, in line with that plan right now. And part of that is making sure that we're -- the developments that we're pursuing are consistent with the base infrastructure, the technology and the capital efficiency approaches that we've built into that development that tends to drive what we're doing there. I think what -- and Kathy has touched on, we, again, had anticipated the market recovery and some of the tightness and so had developed some contracting strategies and partnering with suppliers to try to mitigate that impact. That's paying off. We're seeing that advantage here in the Permian. Eventually, that obviously will roll off. Some of the consumables and some of the labor tight -- tightness that we're seeing in the Permian, obviously, that's starting to impact us as well. So we are seeing inflationary pressures. The expectation is that will continue to grow as the work activity opens up and as some of the logistics constraints get resolved. And we're basically -- we've challenged the team to try to manage that and to make sure that as we look at progressing development and grow that production that we're doing it in a constructive way and not undermining the cost of supply or the advantaged position of those barrels where they sit in the supply -- cost of supply curve for the industry. So I think we're going to -- this disciplined approach that we've talked about is not so much a spend, but in terms of efficiency and making sure that everything -- that every dollar we spend there is productive. And the challenge for that team is to make sure we don't lose productivity of the capital that we're spending. Jennifer Driscoll : Thanks, Darren, and thanks, everybody, for your time and for your questions this morning. We appreciate that. We will post a transcript of the call on our investor website early next week. Have a great weekend. Thanks. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining Exxon Mobil's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me today are : Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Our quarterly presentation with prerecorded remarks was posted earlier today on the Investors section of our website, along with the second quarter earnings news release. During our live 1-hour conference call, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from the earlier presentation before we move to the question-and-answer period. May I remind you that during this call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. We also have provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, including reconciliation. Now please turn to Slide 3, and we'll turn the call over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter operational and financial results were very strong. While the market has clearly been a factor, our results reflect our focus on the fundamentals as well as plans and investments we put in motion several years ago and stuck with through the depths of the pandemic. They also reflect the outstanding work of our teams across the world to operate our facility safely at high utilization levels, which drove needed production and throughput. We are proud of their commitment to supplying the energy and products the world needs and delivering on our strategic priorities. Increased production, higher realizations and aggressive cost control generated strong earnings and cash flow. We also delivered excellent safety and operating performance. As global demand recovers, we continued to invest in our portfolio and grew our year-to-date production in the Permian by about 130,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day versus the first half of 2021. For the full year, in the Permian, we expect to achieve 25% production growth for the second consecutive year. In Guyana, our total capacity is now more than 340,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.  Our Liza Phase 1 development is producing above design capacity with excellent performance. Liza Phase 2 started production earlier this year and has recently reached the design capacity of 220,000 barrels per day. As demand has continued to recover, so is production from our industry-leading refining circuit. We increased throughput by 180,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2021.  We continue to demonstrate our value as an essential partner during the quarter. For example, Exxon Mobil has recently been awarded an interest in Qatar's North Field East expansion. We have worked closely with the Qataris for decades. This attractive agreement further leverages our experience as a global leader in LNG, giving us the opportunity to help grow Qatar's LNG capacity by 30 million tons per annum by 2026. Partnerships such as these are also an important part of unlocking future opportunities in our new businesses like carbon capture and storage. We recently signed multiple MOUs to explore the development of large-scale CCS projects in China, Australia, the Netherlands and Indonesia. Lastly, we further strengthened our portfolio by advancing a significant refining capacity expansion on the U.S. Gulf Coast, discovering new resources in Guyana, progressing LNG production in Mozambique and addressing noncore assets with announced divestments totaling more than $3 billion. We continue to invest through the pandemic with the understanding that demand would recover. With the Beaumont refinery expansion, we're on pace to increase our refining capacity on the U.S. Gulf Coast by more than 17% or 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we also announced 2 discoveries in Guyana, adding to the estimated recoverable resource base, which is nearly 11 billion barrels. Natural gas began flowing at the Coral LNG project offshore Mozambique. The project remains on track to achieve the first LNG cargo later this year. Finally, we progressed our divestment program at an advantageous point in the cycle, announced asset sales include XTO Energy Canada, our Romanian Upstream affiliate and our Barnett Shale gas assets. Barnett Shell divestment closed in the second quarter. The other 2 are anticipated to close later this year, subject to regulatory approvals.  Overall, it was a very strong quarter in both financial results and in progressing our strategic priorities. The strong second quarter results reflect a tight global market environment where demand has recovered to near pre-pandemic levels and supply has attrited. The situation was made worse by the events in Ukraine, which have contributed to increases in prices for crude, natural gas and refined products. In the first quarter, average Brent crude prices rose by about $22 per barrel. In the second quarter, Brent crude prices moved up by another $12 per barrel, pushing the benchmark marginally above the 10-year range. Natural gas prices remain well above the 10-year historical ranges amid ongoing concerns about European supply. Refining margins are even more pronounced versus the 10-year range. They remain at very high levels, reflecting the significant impact on refining capacity resulting from the pandemic. In July, we saw some relief as margins moderated with improved supply and demand balances.  Global Chemical margins in contrast remain near the bottom of the cycle. However, we did see a slight improvement in the quarter, mainly in Asia Pacific. Margins in North America tightened during the quarter as product prices continue to lag the steep increases in ethane feedstock cost, consistent with higher gas prices. Before recapping our financial results, let me touch on the market environment that underpins them. As I mentioned in my prerecorded remarks, large annual investments in oil and gas production are required to offset normal depletion, even more is required to grow net production. Prior to the pandemic, industry investments were below historical levels. The economy-wide shutdowns during the pandemic exacerbated the problem. We are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. We clearly see the tightness in supply in refining, where the closure rate during the pandemic was 3x the rate of the 2008 financial crisis. Given the long investment cycle times, growing supply will not happen overnight. At ExxonMobil, throughout this period, we stayed focused on the fundamentals and led our IOC peers in oil and gas investment. We leaned in when others leaned out, including investments in U.S. refining capacity, notably with our Beaumont refinery expansion. Our investments over the last 5 years are paying off today and helping to meet the needs of families everywhere with greater supply than otherwise would be the case. While progressing investments in our traditional businesses, we are also advancing a portfolio of opportunities consistent with our core capabilities in low-carbon solutions. We expect that these 2 will pay off in the years ahead for our shareholders and for our environment. With that as a backdrop, let's turn to the second quarter financial results. Earnings totaled nearly $18 billion on increased production, higher liquids and natural gas realizations and strong refining margins. We continue to drive efficiencies with $6 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019. We remain on track to achieve more than $9 billion in savings by 2023. CapEx was $4.6 billion in the quarter and $9.5 billion year-to-date. We remain on track for our full year CapEx guidance of $21 billion to $24 billion. Cash flow from operations was $20 billion, further strengthening our balance sheet. Our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to about 13%, while the growth ratio is now at 20%, at the low end of our target range. We returned $7.6 billion to shareholders during the quarter in the form of dividends and share repurchases. The increase in distribution reflects the confidence we have in our strategy, performance we are seeing across our businesses and renewed strength of our balance sheet. I'll conclude with a few key takeaways. As I mentioned earlier, we are now experiencing tight markets across most of our businesses as supply lags demand recovery. Our strong performance reflects the sizable investments we've been making over the past several years and our focus on the fundamentals. Those 2 things put us in a great position to deliver increased production at a time when the world needs it most. We're continuing to increase production of low-cost barrels in Guyana and the Permian. We're doing all of this while maximizing output of our existing facilities, including a new daily production record set by PNG LNG in July. Our new Corpus Christi complex was cash and earnings positive in the first half of the year with the world-scale steam cracker demonstrating design capacity. Our U.S. Gulf Coast refining capacity is poised to increase by about 250,000 barrels per day with the start-up of the Beaumont refinery expansion project in the first quarter of 2023. Two new LNG projects are also advancing. Coral LNG and Mozambique is set to deliver its first cargo in the second half of this year. Our Golden Pass LNG project, which will provide 18 million tons per year of new LNG supplies, remains on schedule to start up in 2024. Once completed, Golden Pass will increase LNG from the Gulf Coast by 20%. In addition, we continue to divest nonstrategic assets at an opportune point in the cycle. We delivered strong safety and reliability while controlling costs. These moves are improving our asset mix, lowering our breakevens and boosting our resiliency. Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to grow our portfolio of opportunities with the 4 newly announced carbon capture and storage opportunities in Australia, China, Indonesia and the Netherlands. I'm extremely proud of the work our people are doing. All of their efforts are consistent with our strategic priorities, which our shareholders are being rewarded for. Today, with an even stronger balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest and to drive shareholder returns throughout the cycles. Our focus on the fundamentals is unchanged. We continue to leverage our core capabilities to advance our strategic priorities and to make the investments needed in this long-cycle business. With our constancy of purpose and consistent approach, we will successfully address the dual challenge, providing energy and products modern societies need while lowering society's greenhouse gas emissions, leading industry in the energy transition. Thank you. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Darren. [Operator Instructions]. With that, Jennifer, could you open up the line for questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : One macro question and then one micro question, Darren. I want to continue on the theme of energy security. -- and you're one of the largest energy providers in Europe. And so I would love your perspective on the European energy challenges that are being faced right now. How does the continent ultimately work its way through it -- and what is ExxonMobil's role in providing energy to the region? Darren Woods : Sure. Well, Neil, I think you're touching on what is a very challenging situation today. And that reflects, I think, the complexity associated with making a massive change to a system that's so critically important to people's lives. And so I think going forward and what we're seeing happening today is a, what I'd say, is a broader net being cast with respect to how we think about the transition and how that evolves. Making sure that we've got a diversified portfolio of energy and one -- and sources of energy that are not dependent on any one nation state, which is, I think, an important step that we're seeing being taken. I think there'll be a drive over time to make sure that they're leveraging the resources available to them. And I'll just make one example would be the potential that we see for fracking and unconventional gas in Germany. I think the industry has proven over the years that unconventional gas can be produced safely and you then have a secure source of supply and economically and reliable source of supply. And so I think there's an opportunity where certainly, Exxon Mobil could play a key role. We also have a fairly large refining footprint in Europe. We've been working hard to upgrade those facilities, make sure that we're driving their emissions footprints to zero and developing plans to do that. And within this current crisis, have really stepped up the efforts to reduce our consumption of natural gas. In fact, if you look at our refining circuit, we reduced the use of natural gas by 65%. And -- that's the equivalent gas use for about -- for powering about 2 million homes in Europe. And so there are some substantial steps that we can take with respect to optimizing our current operation. Longer term, we're opening up -- looking at projects to expand our LNG import facilities. And of course, we are bringing LNG projects online. We've got the Golden Pass project here in the U.S., which will allow us to export LNG from the U.S. into Europe. And so we've got Mozambique, and that's coming on the back end of this year. And of course, we've got work going on in PNG. And so bringing more LNG supplies to help offset some of the Russian gas going into Europe will be another really critical step forward and the diversification of supplies for Europe. Neil Mehta : And the follow-up is around capital returns. Just talk through how you're thinking about the dividend where there hasn't been a reset this year at least and whether it makes sense to return back to dividend growth and return of capital, a very strong buyback number in the quarter. How are you thinking about tracking towards the $30 billion that you outlined a couple of months ago? Kathryn Mikells : Sure. I'm happy to take that. So look, as you know, our first priority is to continue to invest in the business. And we talked last quarter about the fact that we expect it to build our cash balance to between $20 billion to $30 billion, which gives us both a strong balance sheet and a strong cash balance, which we view as a competitive advantage that provides us flexibility through the cycle. We're trying to strike the right balance in terms of share repurchases and dividends. As you know, we raised our quarterly dividend by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of 2021. And last quarter, we tripled the size of our share repurchase plan, which is now up to $30 billion of share repurchases this year and next.  So we're definitely focused on being efficient as we look to return capital to shareholders. And obviously, the share repurchase program has a secondary benefit of reducing the nominal size of our dividend. So I'd say we're trying to strike the right balance. Our Board reviews this pretty regularly, and we feel good about where we're at right now. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you. And just a reminder, a single question per analyst, please. Jennifer? Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Darren, I wonder if I could ask first about natural gas in Europe. And specifically, your European gas production, obviously has come down a bit over the years, but it was some -- it was up sequentially in the second quarter when normally we see a seasonal downtrend for you guys in the summertime. Is this how we should think about your European gas production going forward that for obvious reasons, it's more of a flat line. And I wonder if you could address any specific issues around Groningen could be revisited by the Dutch government after given everything that's going on. Darren Woods : Sure. Doug, it's good to hear you again. With respect to demand, you're right. If you go back in time, under more normal circumstances, we do see a seasonal decline in the second quarter with gas demand, and that's historically been in the numbers, and we tend to foreshadow that in the first quarter, typically. This year, obviously, circumstances in Europe are very different, and we actually foreshadowed the first quarter that we didn't expect to see the same kind of seasonal dip because of the shortages that we were seeing in Europe at the time. And so I think going forward, obviously, a big question mark will be how the whole landscape and supply picture shapes up in Europe. And also, obviously, a big factor in gas demand will be weather. And so I think I wouldn't take this quarter as the new norm. I think we've just got to stay attuned to how the landscape develops there, what supply looks like and then obviously keep an eye on the weather. With respect to your question on Groningen, it's -- the capacity is there. It's something that the Dutch government obviously has control of and evaluates the circumstances and make decisions in terms of the production that they request our joint venture there NAM to produce. And so that will be a function of how the Dutch government kind of weighs off the demand for gas versus the supplies and the role they want Groningen to play. But the capacity is there. Doug Leggate : Okay. Kathy, I wonder, a very quick follow-up on Neil's question. I wonder if I could just ask very specifically, when you joined I seem to recall you expressing some concern of the absolute scale of the dividend burden. Now I realize there's a lot of operational cash flow growth in the future for Exxon. But when we think about the balances of buybacks, dividend policy and so on, is your objective to reduce that absolute dividend burden to help us kind of calibrate what that might look like going forward? And I'll leave it there. Kathryn Mikells : Yes. So let me start with the Board and we are very focused on ensuring that we take an efficient approach in terms of how we're returning capital to shareholders. And obviously, share repurchases are a very efficient way to do that. As we look at the dividend, I'd say there's a number of things that we continue to evaluate. I mean clearly, we think it's pretty critical that we have a competitive dividend. And today, we think we do have a competitive dividend. We do look at that nominal level of the dividend and share repurchases do have a secondary benefit of reducing that level. But I'd also tell you, importantly, all the actions we're taking in the business reduce our breakevens, right? We talked about that a lot at Investor Day. Our breakeven came down to $41 a barrel from $44 kind of last year. We have a trajectory as we looked at the plan that we presented at Investor Day and based on that price set to kind of bring our breakevens down farther to $35 a barrel. So that just builds more resiliency in the business, which makes I'd say, the overall kind of dividend much easy for the company to both sustain and in the future to grow. So that is how we look at it and how we think about that. And as I said previously, we're trying to strike the right balance in terms of growing that dividend and doing buybacks, which have the secondary benefit of reducing that nominal dividend, and they also are a very efficient way for us to return capital to shareholders. And then I'd say, importantly, we want to make sure we're taking an approach as it relates to our cash balance and our overall balance sheet that enables us to sustain both investments and shareholder returns through the cycle. That is how we generate the highest value for shareholders. And so we're very focused on doing that. Doug Leggate : Breakeven point is very [salient] (ph). Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : I wanted to ask about the Permian business specifically, and you continue to post strong results there. And there were some comments in the posted prepared remarks, I think a bit of an acceleration or increase in activity broadly in short cycle in the back half of the year. And I think that's referencing the Permian specifically. So I just wondering if you could comment if that reference refers to an acceleration activity versus your prior plans? And then also, as you think about the outlook over the next several years, can you talk a little bit about some of the inflationary trends that you're seeing in the shale business and then also the ability to offset that with efficiency gains? Darren Woods : Yes. Devin, I'll touch on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. With respect to Permian, the plan that we laid out some time ago, and we're currently executing is -- hasn't changed, and we had a very slight ramp-up as we head through the year, but nothing significantly different than what we have been doing. The plans that we have in place should deliver, and our current production is in line with that 25% growth versus last year, which, as you know, was on top of 25% growth the year before. And as we saw on the package, if you look at our tight oil production in the U.S. versus 2017, we expect to end 2022 at 3x the level of production. So I would say the strategy remains in place, the plans that we're actually getting remains in place. We're looking for opportunities within the construct that we define to extend and expand the activities. But frankly, given the tightness in the market, the availability of rigs, there's not a whole lot of opportunity to move there. And maybe I'll ask Kathy to cover the inflationary topic. Kathryn Mikells : Yes. So overall, I'd say we feel really good about how we're managing inflation to date. Our overall structural cost savings kind of plan and program is very much on track. As of this quarter, we're now at $6 billion in overall savings kind of relative to 2019. So we're feeling pretty good about that. As we look at our kind of cost on a year-over-year basis, we obviously had a kind of seasonal increase in costs sequentially as we had a little bit more planned maintenance activity, but we feel very good that we're executing consistent with our plans and that we remain on track. We're obviously not immune to inflation. We did a great job certainly during the pandemic, especially when you think about our kind of longer projects that our global project group was executing in terms of ensuring that we were at that point in time when we were in a deflationary environment, really working hard with our service providers to extend contracts and looking to revised schedules associated with some of our projects but still moving the engineering forward on those things so that we could spool them up as the market environment improves. So we feel good about where we're at with our CapEx programs overall, and we feel good about the cost savings that we've -- that we're driving. I'd also say it isn't always going to look exactly the same kind of quarter-to-quarter. We obviously just made some significant changes in our organizational structure that were put in place in April. Those will, over time, also drive additional efficiencies for us. And we are working at constant, I'd say, pipeline in this area to ensure that we're both driving greater efficiency across the business, but also effectiveness, which is equally important. So I'd say we feel really good about where we're at. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Great. Darren, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the refining outlook. It's probably a more volatile environment than we've seen in a long time, certainly with less Asian exports are certainly out of China and what's going on in Europe. So I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about that and based on your background, some insights there would be helpful. Darren Woods : Sure. Happy to do that, Stephen. Thanks for calling in. Yes, you say it's a volatile area. I think the thing that's really changed in the refining landscape, which has impacted -- we're seeing that impact across a lot of industries and parts of our business is the pandemic. If you go back since 2020 and as we've mentioned in our prepared presentation, 3 million barrels a day of refining capacity has come out of the circuit since the pandemic. And what has typically happened, which is 3x the rate of historical levels. And typically, historical levels have been offset by new builds coming in. And of course, a lot of those new builds got pushed out because of the pandemic and the lack of revenue in the extremely negative and poor refining margins. And so we've created this hole with a lot more capacity coming off-line without a whole lot of new capacity, typically out and developing in parts of the world in Asia and the Middle East. That capacity is not coming on. So we've got this gap, demand recovers, and we don't have the capacity to meet that, which has led to a record, record-high refining margins. So I think the solution there is with time for additional capacity to come on. We're pleased that we had justified a fairly large expansion in our Beaumont refinery. Essentially, based on transportation differentials that generated a reasonable return with potential upsides in times of tight markets, which obviously we're going to be seeing as we bring this refinery expansion on. It's the biggest expansion over a decade in the U.S. And it's one that takes advantage of the utilities and the units that we already have and the connection that we have with the Permian. So a very advantaged project coming onto the market at a really good time. Outside of that, I don't see a whole lot of additional expansions here in the U.S. And then as we mentioned in the presentation, over the next 2 years, probably 1 million barrels a day of capacity, including the 2 50 at our site coming on in the marketplace, which is still fairly short of the capacity that came off. And so our view is we're going to see what I say, the tighter supply and demand balance. One of the real question marks out there is what happens with demand. I would tell you, even at 2019 levels, the market is relatively tight. And so I expect a tighter market and maybe elevated margins versus what the historical norm is. But I would expect much lower than what we've experienced here in the second quarter. But -- and then with time, we'll see that capacity come back on out in Asia and the Middle East. And the world market is very efficient, and those barrels will flow to the demand centers and balance things off. And so I think this will be a few year price environment, and we'll get back to what I think is a more typical refining industry structure. Operator : We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Question maybe just moving to the asset side of things on Guyana. Exxon has had really tremendous success there and not only just from a resource perspective. Are we at the point where we should be maybe adjusting our thinking on what time lines are just given the really good execution that you've had so far? I guess, where we're going at is each phase has come on faster, capacity is creeping up in the meantime and infill opportunities, they continue to look really promising. So at what point should we kind of be compressing time lines? Darren Woods : Thank you, Jeanine. Well, you're right, we have seen really good progress in what's happening on Guyana. I think it illustrates one of the advantages of a consistency of approach and just moving from one development to the other. We started off with Liza 1 with a smaller concept to get started and recognize that we would build on that and extend on the design that we had. So we had a concept of design one, build many. Obviously, as our discoveries mature and we get a better understanding of the reservoir and the development opportunities there, we will adjust those designs. So I think it's a function of really the development plans that we put in place and the right project to most efficiently deliver -- to develop those resources, and that will change as we move around that block and with the different structures and resources. So I wouldn't say, I think stay tuned as our plans mature and we get a better line of sight to it. We'll give you updates and let you know how we see that coming. I think with Payara, we did bring that one forward and announced that recently given the progress we're making. And as we continue to progress the other ones, we'll update you and the rest of the market on how we see those things coming together. But I'm very encouraged and feel good about the progress we're making and hope to see continued advancement in bringing those projects forward faster. Operator : We'll move next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : My question is on the low carbon side. The earnings release had a nice reminder of the list of projects you've announced and what you're involved in. Earlier this week, we had a bill drafted in Senate that addressed the key categories in low carbon for you, which are carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels. And so now that you've said as you scope the low carbon business, you're not interested in sort of reacting to policy, you want to be ahead of things and you want to try to anticipate some of the incentives that come down. So I wonder if this bill is aligned with what you had anticipated. If assuming it passes, if you think we're in the zone where your efforts here are really going to be supported or if you think there's more work to do or other regions where there might be better opportunities in the U.S.? Darren Woods : Sure. No, thanks for your question. I think it's very timely and relevant. What I would say is, and what we've been talking about is we're pleased with the broader recognition that a more comprehensive set of solutions are going to be needed to address the challenges of an energy transition. And so the discussion evolving from just wind and solar and EVs to carbon capture, storage and biofuels and hydrogen is really important. And the recognition globally and with governments, particularly our government, that those are important technologies that need to be developed. And importantly, the markets need to be catalyzed and early investments incentivized, we think, is a really important development. And so while we -- I'm not real familiar with what's in the legislation since it's just come out, I think it is encouraging to see the recognition and the desire to try to catalyze investments in this space because as we've said, we think they're going to be absolutely critical for society to achieve its longer-term ambitions and to make significant reductions commissions. And so it's a step in the right direction. Our portfolio, we're trying to develop a diversified approach. We've got many of the projects within the portfolio that reduce our own emissions and do it economically. The total returns at about 10% on that portfolio. And of course, Dan running low carbon solutions working hard to improve on that. And then we've got other large projects that where we anticipate incentives coming in either through the market or through policy that we started the planning and development on so that as that policy develops, we'll have a project radian moving into execution. Blue hydrogen is one where that will be beneficial if those incentives come to pass, given the concept that we have there. So I'd say generally a step in the right direction. I would also tell you, moving beyond the U.S. and more broadly looking around the world, a much more significant and serious effort in terms of looking for opportunities in the carbon capture, hydrogen, ammonia space and the biofuel space. And I've been pleased at the interest for governments all around the world and partners all around the world to engage with Exxon Mobil and to leverage the capabilities that we can bring to the space to help develop large-scale projects that make significant reductions and emissions. So I'd say really positive vectors in this space, and we feel good about how we're positioned. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to ask about the current investment environment just given what's going on geopolitically in Russia. And I think there's 2 schools of thought out there, one that this is kind of accelerating a push to invest in new lower carbon energy because the current energy system has all these geopolitical risks. And another one that, in fact, we need to invest in more hydrocarbons because the world is clearly short that. So I'm just hoping you could kind of frame broadly where you think the industry, government, how the conversations have gone and if you think the crisis that we're currently in is accelerating the push towards greener energy or hydrocarbons? Darren Woods : You bet, Jason. I think the short answer is yes. It's incentivizing, I think, both of those. And I think that's appropriate to look where there's an opportunity to take advantage of what I'll call the natural endowments in terms of sun and wind to deploy those technologies and renewable technologies to generate power. But at the same time, I think there's a recognition that there are deficiencies in those technologies. And while they offer an important solution and are necessary, they're not sufficient. And so I think at the same time, a recognition that we need to do more, particularly with gas given its cleaner footprint.  And I think a recognition as it was just speaking with Sam about, that the challenge here is emissions. Not oil and gas itself, it's the combustion of oil and gas and the emissions associated with that. And so dealing with emissions through carbon capture and storage is another opportunity to address the problem at a much lower cost and in a much quicker time frame. And so my sense and the conversations I'm having with governments around the world is a recognition of this broader approach, a basket of technologies are going to be needed and emphasis should be put on all the ones for the right reasons at the right time and consciously and explicitly recognizing the deficiencies and making sure that we're mitigating those deficiencies. It was just in Europe and having a conversation with some of the government leaders there and clearly recognize the challenge associated with renewables, wind and solar and the intermittency issue and a recognition that gas and gas fired power gen will be an important backstop to address that. So I think there's a much more holistic approach being taken and a more thoughtful one. And I think that's encouraging. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada. Biraj Borkhataria : Just one quick follow-up and then one question. So the follow-up is on grown again. I understand it's a government decision, but you talked about the technical capacity to increase volumes there. Are you able to quantify what is the capacity because in the past, that field has produced sort of up to 50 Bcm historically, many, many years ago. And then the question I had is on your comments on Liza. You mentioned the first phase was producing above design capacity. I asked a few quarters ago about Papua New Guinea, which is also producing above capacity, and you have quite a good track record there of increasing the nameplate capacity more than once. So could you talk about the opportunity at Liza? And potentially quantify how far above capacity you could go for the additional units? Because presumably, your targets are based on design capacity only. But it'd be good to get some color on that. Darren Woods : Yes. You bet, Raj. What I would say is on Groningen, there's significant capacity there. Obviously, there's a balance that has to be struck and I know the Dutch government is very focused on responsible production there as are we. And so I think it won't be a limit of the capacity. It will more be a limit as to what the government thinks is necessary to produce given the circumstances there. So I don't know that there's a -- I wouldn't think of it as a capacity limit with respect to the facilities that we have there, but more of what do we want to do to try to balance the risk and the rewards associated with production out of that field. On the expansion and going above design capacity, I would tell you, been very, very pleased and frankly, proud of the organization and the work they've done really across the entire portfolio. You mentioned Liza and PNG, which are both really good examples and the ones that we've highlighted. But I would tell you, almost all the new projects that we're bringing on, as we line those out and get them up and running, the teams get very quickly focused on debottlenecking and optimizing and taking it above production capacity. And so I think we've got a long history of that. I think the way we have organized our technology and engineering organization now where we can leverage the learnings and capabilities and competencies every part of the organization on to any one particular asset is a huge, huge competitive leverage. And in fact, that's part of the improvements that we're seeing. In fact, at PNG, we brought downstream -- historical downstream optimization technology into that upstream traditional upstream facility, and that's making a big difference seeing that across a number of different platforms. So I don't have a new number to give you in terms of how to think about these. I would just tell you that you should feel comfortable that the organization to push and strive for getting the most -- the kit that we build and the projects that we bring online. And we'll give you updates as we're moving through here on the organization, successful with that to let you know how we're doing and growing that production. Biraj Borkhataria : Could you say how far about capacity Liza 1 is producing? Darren Woods : 10% above. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Maybe coming back to a couple of the policy questions that have been asked. Do you have a Slide 5 in the presentation, right, shows investment maybe where it should be versus where it is and where it's projected. And then I'm just curious, as we think about some of the policy you talked about maybe checking the box of all of the above as you're meeting with various governments.  Would that allow the global investment to get back on the track necessary as we look out over several years? And if not, wouldn't that indicate that we're going to be looking at multiple years of above normal or above, let's call it, mid-cycle commodity prices? Because when I think about a $41 breakeven, maybe a $60, $65 mid-cycle, but an underinvestment situation that says oil prices are likely to exceed that. Doesn't that set up Exxon very well to, I think, one of the questions asked earlier, be more aggressive on the cash returns front. Just curious how you think that sliding together. Darren Woods : Yes. Well, I think, Roger, it's a complicated space you're asking about, but a good one. I do think if over time, policymakers focus on what I think the real challenge with the energy transition is, which is dealing with emissions and the broader door opens for, say, carbon capture and storage or hydrogen and specifically blue hydrogen that, that opens up the door for additional oil and gas and the receptiveness of oil and gas coming on the marketplace, which I think frankly, is important just given the costs associated with the transition. If you can find ways to use existing infrastructure and don't have to rewire your entire industrial processes and power generation systems, that's going to be a win for society as we bring down emissions. And so that may open the door. I think that will just -- time will tell. And if that does, obviously, the demand changes. And maybe that incentivizes more investment and get you back into the range that's shown on the chart. From our perspective, what will change our investment is finding these advantaged opportunities. I think our view has been and continues to be that we're going to look for the opportunities where we can leverage the capabilities and competitive advantage of the corporation and generate above-industry average returns. The portfolio we've been advancing does that. We've got others that we're working on potential opportunities in the pipeline that we think will do that. And so as we are successful at securing those opportunities or developing them, you'll see those come into the portfolio. And frankly, the size of that investment will be a function of kind of how big those -- or the number of those projects that we find that are advantaged are. So that's kind of the -- how I would summarize it. Roger Read : Can I just ask one kind of clarification on that. If you think about -- and I understand you're doing a lot of things in a lot of different places. But if you think about your investment relative to those various lines, right? What's projected, what's necessary and where Exxon is today? Where do you feel Exxon hits on that curve? Darren Woods : Well, I would say, Rog, you've got to put what we're doing today and what we've got plan going forward in the context of what we've been doing over the last 5 years. You will recall back in 2018, we talked about aggressively investing in these opportunities and doing it countercyclically. While others were pulling back, we were leaning in. And that meant that we spent -- and you will recall this, I got a lot of pressure on this and criticism is spending that money upfront out of the cycle, which I think is paying off today. I think that was the right strategy is not to ramp up spending in the heat of the moment or the heat of the market. And so that strategy is paying off. You've got to look across that type cycle and I would say, aggregate the investments that we've been making. My expectation is we'll see -- we'll continue to see cycles in this industry. We're going to continue to look for the opportunities, particularly in the down cycle to bring advantaged investments forward. And that's the way we're going to be thinking about and looking at it. Operator : Go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : Darren, my question is, again, on shareholder returns. Specifically, given the massive amount of cash, you don't have the post the nice quarterly cash flow. Would you all consider externally ramping up some more of the shorter cycle return assets like your Permian position given based on our number, what looks like to be notable discounts that many of the independent producers are trading at spread? Darren Woods : Yes. So in terms of our organic opportunities in the Permian, it will -- we're not going to step outside of the strategy that we developed in terms of driving capital-efficient production in the Permian. You'll recall we've talked about the corridor approach that we're pursuing in the Delaware. The fact that we've pre-invested in facilities there. We've got a very aggressive technology program that we've been working on for some time now. That's being built and brought into our production and drilling there. And one of the reasons why we're seeing some of the advances and cost and efficiency is driven by a lot of that work we've been doing in the technology space. We've got more technology that we're looking to bring into that. And so that's helping the development and the productivity of that development. We don't want to get too far ahead of that. So there are a lot of parameters that we're keeping an eye on to make sure that we deliver on our commitments to produce there at very low cost, have very low breakevens and high cash flow. That's the way we're thinking about it. Neal Dingmann : But no thoughts like we did in '17 rate. I do think '17 buying -- externally buying other assets in the permit outside of the largest position you already have? Darren Woods : I think we are always looking for acquisition opportunities. That has been -- that's always on the radar. And as you know, the key secret or the key advantage there you got to find is assets that fit with your advantages that you can bring additional value and improve value through an acquisition. So absolutely, that remains on the radar. I think as we work these technologies, as we advance our processes and techniques, that opens up additional advantage, which we can then look at and apply to other potential opportunities. So that's kind of the formula that we have there, and we're keeping our eyes open. Operator : We'll go next to Manav Gupta with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Manav Gupta : My quick question here is we are hearing some worries on -- where we have a debate if U.S. is in a recession or not in a recession globally, also the same debate. I'm just trying to understand whether it's your refining business or your chemicals business? Are you seeing any early signs of recessionary demand kicking in or demand destruction whether it relates to the refining business or maybe your commodity chemical business? If you could help us understand how demand is trending in somewhat of a challenging GDP or global economic data. Darren Woods : Sure, Manav. I'll take a crack at that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. I think certainly, the dialogue that I've heard externally in this space is it's a complex picture to try to dissect to understand. And of course, the debate are we in a recession on a recession, I think, is in part a factor of this complicated landscape that we're looking at. I would say within our industry, it's no less complicated when you think about a lot of the supply constraints, some logistics challenges that we're facing. So it's difficult to get a really clear read on what's driving variation demand quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month given some of those logistics challenges that we're seeing inventory withdrawals and builds. And so a complicated space. I think bottom line is I wouldn't tell you that we're seeing something that would say we are in a recession or a near recession. But I would also say that it's a complex picture, frankly. The demand destruction question that you asked, I wouldn't tie and what we have seen is, obviously, earlier this year as prices really spiked up there is a level of discretionary demand, and we saw some of that demand come off with very high prices. As prices have come back down again, you're seeing some of that recover. And so I would say that's just the normal price response that you see with respect to demand and not tied to, say, a more macroeconomic picture.  I don't know, Kathy, if you have anything to add? Kathryn Mikells : Yes. The only other thing I would add to that is, overall, when you look at demand recovering from the lows of the pandemic. One of the laggards has been jet, obviously. And so jet continues to lag, but is obviously starting to pick up now as people are starting to travel and obviously, international travel restrictions have reduced, which means people are also starting to travel a bit more internationally. But we continue to also see some effects of COVID. The fact that China was in lockdowns in the second quarter certainly kind of impacted our chemicals business a little bit, right? And so we saw a bit of our volumes coming off there, specifically in Asia, responding to that. So there's going to continue to be these impacts, both the ongoing recovery from the pandemic. And then obviously, some COVID impacts and now kind of intersecting with a bit more uncertainty associated with just the overall macro environment. The last thing I'd say is we tend to be an organization that prepares for the worst and hopes for the best. So I'd tell you, we're certainly preparing for every eventuality. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : My question is on the chemicals business. I know you've had some headwinds in 2Q from both a margin and a volume perspective. You had called out China lockdown specifically, and that piece might be a little tough to forecast. But can you speak to your outlook there for the second half in both the U.S. and globally in the Chemicals business? Darren Woods : Sure. I'll start off on that and then see if Kathy wants to add anything. I would tell you, what we're seeing here in the second quarter and we made reference to is while the ethane advantage that we have in the U.S., North America still is an advantage versus the rest of the world as gas prices go up and crude prices moderate and more naphthas out there. That advantage weekends, and we saw that with respect to the margin. But still reasonably healthy demand and good demand growth year-on-year. China obviously is an important market. And so as we move in and out of lockdowns there, that will have an impact on our chemicals demand. And the automotive market is an important market. And with some of the challenges they've had there with chips and production issues that has had in the short-term impacts, and we'll have to see how those get resolved. My expectation is as that gets resolved in automotive production, that was to pick up, we'd see that again, recover within our portfolio. So that's kind of the landscape that we see today and really be a function of where does China end up going with respect to its response to COVID. Kathy, anything to add? Kathryn Mikells : Yes. The only thing I would add is, as we look forward, there are more supply coming on in chemicals specifically. And so we can see projects most of them are targeted in China, and China is obviously long term, one of the fastest-growing markets for chemicals, but we're also seeing some additional supply that's going to come on in North America. And this is obviously part of the cyclicality in the business. Supply tends to come on in large chunks, and it takes a little while for overall supply and demand to then come back in balance. So that's the only other thing that I would add. Jennifer Driscoll : Thanks. I think we have time for one more question, Jen. Operator : Looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question will be from Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Yes. Maybe just one follow-up on some of the earlier comments on the low carbon businesses. On the carbon capture front, you called out a number of projects in the release, you're progressing in a number of those different projects around the world. As you look at these I mean, how would you describe the commonalities in these projects? What is and isn't working on carbon capture? Are there technical similarities that are driving progress in these locations or specific progress or projects, political or fiscal support? And what are some of the key things that you need to see either technically or regulatory-wise to kind of -- to grow this business further, I'd say. Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I think if you look at today's technology, it has applicability. It's economic for more concentrated streams of CO2. As you move down the seriatum of emissions, so to speak, and the CO2 concentration becomes more and more dilute, that existing technology becomes more and more expensive. And I think that's one of the key challenges. And so one of the areas that we're working with our technology organizations is developments in technology that allow more economic capture of more diluted CO2 streams. And so I would say that's one constraint that's going to require technical advances to make it more affordable going forward. But outside that, within the streams that have the necessary concentration to make existing technology work, key variables will be storage and access to storage. And access to storage that's geographically close, logistically close because another key point will be the transportation cost. And so kind of requires concentrated streams of CO2, good logistics systems and storage -- abundant storage that's close by. You put those things together, you've got an equation that you can make these projects work with relatively modest incentive schemes. And in fact, that's what you're seeing with the Houston Hub carbon capture projects that we've tabled a very large source of somewhat concentrated CO2 streams that's logistically close to a good storage in the Gulf of Mexico. So all those equations come together. That require additional incentives, but something that would be reasonably inexpensive compared to the cost societies currently bearing to remove CO2. And as you move around the world, the projects that we're looking at have similar constructs to make that -- those projects viable. And then obviously, the governments are looking at what kind of policy would be required to help support those projects. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Ryan. Thank you, Darren. I think we're out of time. I appreciate everybody's questions today. We will post the transcript of the Q&A session on our investor website early next week. Have a nice weekend, everybody, and I'll turn it back to our operator to conclude our call, Jennifer. Darren Woods : Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call today at our new time of 7 :30 a.m. Central. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This live presentation, our prerecorded remarks and the news release are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from the prerecorded presentation. This allows us more time for questions before we conclude at 8 :30 a.m. Central Time.  During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We encourage you to read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. For additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments, please refer to our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. Please note, we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides.  Now please turn to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Before covering our earnings highlights, I want to begin by recognizing the men and women of ExxonMobil. While this quarter's results were clearly helped by a favorable market, fact is we're in this position because of the hard work and commitment of our people over the past few years. Where others pulled back in the face of uncertainty and a historic slowdown, retreating and retrenching, this company moved forward, continuing to invest and build to help meet the demands we see today and position the company for long-term success in each of our businesses.  We understand how important our role is in providing the energy and products the world needs. And while the market has clearly been a factor, results we report today reflect that deep commitment. I mentioned this because it is at the heart of our company and its culture. We know the role we play and are incredibly proud of it. We work together as a team, confident in our mission and determined to do our part in meeting the world's energy needs and leading the way in a thoughtful energy transition.  Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter operational and financial results. Higher natural gas realizations, strong refinery throughput, robust refining margins and rigorous cost control drove our earnings improvement. We continue to increase production to address the needs of consumers, which contributed to earnings and cash flow growth, a stronger balance sheet and significant value creation. Our results also reflected the outstanding work of our teams across the world who operate our facilities reliably at high utilization rates.  Let me highlight a few examples of our progress. First, Energy Products. We boosted overall refinery throughput to its highest quarterly level since 2008, responding to tight market conditions. And we continue to make progress on the Beaumont refinery expansion, which will increase capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023.  We also increased production from our high-return assets in the Permian and Guyana. Our production in the Permian Basin reached nearly 560,000 oil equivalent barrels per day, building on our strong growth from last year. We grew our production in Guyana to 360,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, with Liza Phase 1 and 2, both exceeding design capacity. We also had continued exploration success with 2 additional discoveries in the quarter. Earlier this month, first LNG production was achieved from Mozambique's Coral South floating LNG development, contributing new supply amid growing demand for LNG globally.  We continue to expect total upstream production of 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels per day for the year. Looking longer term, we remain on track to grow low-cost production and meet our 2027 plan, with more than 90% of our Upstream investments, generating over 10% returns at $35 per barrel.  Our ability to increase production while reducing cost, improves our competitive position, benefits consumers and generates capital to fund meaningful investments, demonstrated by one of our recent press releases, announcing that our low carbon solutions business signed its first and the largest of its kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This marks an important milestone in developing our newest business. It's also a good example of how we're supporting other companies in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. We look forward to sharing more about our progress in developing attractive low-carbon solutions business in December as part of our corporate plan discussions.  We continue to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the sale of our interest in the Aera oil production operations in California and our refinery in Billings, Montana. Proceeds from divestments completed year-to-date totaled $4 billion as we captured incremental value for these noncore assets in today's higher price environment. These sales enable us to concentrate on our higher-value advantaged assets.  Finally, you may have heard earlier this month that with 2 decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated ExxonMobil's interest in Sakhalin-1 and transferred the project to a Russian operator. In March, we stated our intention to exit the Sakhalin-1 project and discontinue our role as operator and took an impairment of approximately $3.4 billion at the time.  While our affiliate was in force majeure due to the unprecedented impact of global sanctions, we continue to make every attempt to engage in good faith discussions with the Russian government and all Sakhalin-1 partners to effect a smooth exit to the benefit of all parties. Our priority all along has been to protect employees, the environment and the integrity of operations at the facility. While the recent decrees violate our rights in Russia established by our production sharing agreement and interrupted the exit process we were working, it did not prevent us from safely winding down our operations. We're proud of our employees and the many significant achievements they led since 1996, including the most recent challenge of the government takeover. We do not anticipate any new material costs associated with the exit.  This next slide illustrates the variability the industry is experiencing across the markets most relevant to our business. In the third quarter, crude prices moved back within the upper end of the 10-year range as higher supply slightly exceeded demand. Natural gas prices rose to record levels in the third quarter, reflecting concerns in Europe about the withdrawal of Russian supply as well as efforts to build inventory ahead of winter. While natural gas prices recently moderated, they remain well above the 10-year historical range.  In the U.S., prices increased by about 15%, driven by higher summer cooling demand and inventory concerns. Refining margins remained well above the 10-year range due to inflated diesel crack spreads, resulting from expensive natural gas and high demand for diesel. Higher refinery runs and flat demand for gasoline in the U.S. resulted in refining margins declining from the second quarter. In contrast, global chemical margins fell below the bottom of the 10-year range, reflecting weakening global demand. Margins in North America and Europe have softened, with regional pricing moving closer to global parity as demand and logistics constraints relaxed.  Asia Pacific remained in bottom-of-cycle conditions as COVID restrictions continue to suppress demand in China. Despite these challenges, our chemical products business delivered another solid quarter on improved product mix, strong reliability and good cost control. Before leaving this chart, I want to make one other very important point, the value of a diversified portfolio. With just the 3 quarters shown, you can see how the value has shifted across our different businesses. Our diversified portfolio has served us well during the volatile swings in prices and margins across the various businesses. As the energy system evolves along an uncertain path, the investments in our broad portfolio of advantaged businesses, including our Low Carbon Solutions business will play an even more important role in capturing value in outperforming competition in the very near term, and across a much longer time horizon.  Before I turn it over to Jennifer, let me recap our key takeaways on the quarter. We continue to progress our advantaged investments, drove additional structural efficiencies and created sustainable solutions that deliver the energy and products everyone needs. This has resulted in strong earnings growth, bolstered by higher refining throughput and cost control which more than offset margin declines.  We've continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from our high-return assets in Guyana and the Permian. In addition, earlier this month, our low carbon solutions business signed the largest-of-its-kind customer contract to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This is a strong indication of the growth opportunity we have in this new business. We've also continued to actively manage our portfolio, announcing the Aera Upstream and Billings refinery divestments and closing the sales of our Romanian Upstream affiliate and XTO Energy Canada. Our diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses and robust balance sheet provide a strong foundation to invest in value-accretive projects and drive attractive shareholder returns through the cycle.  In aggregate, the work we are doing today is delivering critical products in a very short market. Longer term, we're delivering improvements that strengthen our structural advantages, meet society's growing needs for energy and modern products, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and double earnings and cash flow by 2027 versus 2019. In short, profitably leading our industry toward a net zero future. Thank you. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Darren. Before we start our Q&A session, I have two important announcements to share with you all. Please mark your calendar for our annual Corporate Plan Update scheduled for Thursday, December 8 at 8 :30 a.m. Central Standard Time, where I'll be joined by Kathy Mikells to share the details of our corporate plan. Additionally, please keep an eye out for our 2022 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in mid-December.  Now with that, we'll begin our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to you, Katie. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So they were very strong results this quarter in the Downstream business, and you called out throughput, volume and mix as some of the factors there. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about some of the drivers here.  And then just more broadly, there's a lot of moving pieces in the macro picture at the moment of demand, SPR drives, China reopening, the EU embargo on Russian crude, just to name a few. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your outlook for refining as we head into next year as well. Kathryn Mikells : Sure. Why don't I take the first question and maybe give you the macro. So if you look overall at our energy products business, obviously, it was a really strong quarter. That was really, from our perspective, led by the volume increases we saw. So we had record North American throughput. We had across the globe, the best results on throughput that we had seen since in 2008. And so if you look at the earnings bridge in terms of what happened quarter-to-quarter, that was worth almost $1 billion kind of improvement as a big driver in the results for energy products.  If you then look at what's going on in margins, obviously, margins softened in the quarter. They still remain well above what the 10-year average would be. If we look at those softer margins, they were really driven by downward pressure in gasoline margins due to lower-than-usual summer demand, specifically in the U.S. Diesel demand is continuing to be strong.  We then had some offsets to that pressure that we saw on margin. And specifically, if you look at some of the positive offsets we saw, we saw some favorable timing-driven impacts. We try to separate this, so you can kind of see it, separate it. Part of that was just mark-to-market on our open derivative portfolio, that was worth about $250 million favorable impact in the quarter. Other price timing impacts were worth about $600 million favorable impact in the quarter. That was really driven by derivatives that we use to ensure ratable pricing of refinery crude runs.  So if you put that to the side, we delivered about $5 billion in earnings outside of those price timing benefits in the quarter. And in addition to the other offsets for softening refining margins, we saw very strong aromatics margins. We did a good job on revenue management, so we saw positive benefits there. And then overall, I would say, end-to-end, supply chain optimization, right, both through procurement and logistics and trading benefits on top of that. That's really embedded in the base business. And so we expect to see benefits out of those areas. They're not always ratable every quarter. But if you look over time, those benefits clearly accrue to the business. Darren Woods : Yes. And I'd just add, Devin, maybe a couple of points on top of what Kathy just explained. If you step back, you'll recall that we, in 2018, came up with a value chain concept that we're using in the Downstream and really looking to optimize from crude coming in the gate all the way to products being delivered at our customers' doorstep. And the work the organization has been doing to optimize that value chain has resulted in additional value, and I think continues to make that business much more robust than what I would say the industry average is. Kathy mentioned the trading, which has become an integral part of that value chain optimization step. And then I would add finally that a lot of work has been going into making sure that we are positioning those facilities and our Downstream in our refineries to be robust to an evolving demand landscape. And so if you look at where we are investing in refining, it's for sites that have integrated chemicals, lubricants and fast-growing clean fuels business. And we think that gives us a structural advantage versus broader industry.  This has been and always has been a thin margin business. And so you typically scratch through the thin low periods, which lasts for a very long time and then take advantage of some of the highs. And as a result of that thin margin business, if you look over time, certainly in the West, refining capacity has been on the decline. We actually showed a chart last quarter and again this quarter that shows that drop in refining capacity.  If you look at some of the windfall taxes that are being talked about within Europe, that's going to put additional pressure on refining margins. So there is certainly a scenario out there that says we continue to see under-investment refining, we continue to see that capacity coming out of the market. And then depending on the build side of the equation and how much capacity gets built out in the Middle East, we could see tight markets for some time to come. Of course, we don't plan for that. We plan for thin margins and very tough conditions and then hope for the best. Operator : We will take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Good morning and thanks for taking our questions. For our question and only question, bad habit here, it's on the balance sheet and cash returns. So I guess gross debt to cap now is just below the target range. Cash is now at $30 billion, which is at the top end of, I believe, the $20 billion to $30 billion level that you cited before that you want to maintain over time. So I guess what are the implications on the trajectory of the buyback?  And how are you really viewing the trade-off between potentially accelerating buyback sooner rather than later, given just the mechanical synergies of the dividend and then just being more aggressive on dividend increases, and there was a nice bump announced this morning to the dividend. Kathryn Mikells : Sure. So first of all, I'd say our capital allocation priorities continue to be consistent and we're executing well against that. We've got to continue to make sure we're investing in the business. It's a long-cycle business and that consistency is really critical. We look for accretive acquisition opportunities. We're pretty disciplined in that area. And you've obviously seen us more recently looking to execute a number of divestitures in what's been a pretty good market for that activity. We are really focused on ensuring that we've got a fortress balance sheet that gives us all the firepower and flexibility that we need to operate through the cycles and be really prepared for the next downturn. And then we're also really focused on ensuring that we're sharing our success with shareholders. We're trying to get that balance right. You obviously referenced the fact that we increased our quarterly dividend by $0.03, so that will be reflected in the fourth quarter dividend coming up here shortly. We're in the process of executing a $30 billion -- up to $30 billion share repurchase program through 2023. We are on track to get $15 billion of that program done by the end of the year. We did about $10.5 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter. And if you look across the year, that would put us at $15 billion in dividends and about $15 billion in share repurchases. So I'd say both a pretty balanced return to our shareholders. And I think that puts us pretty well ahead of peers in terms of returning excess cash to shareholders. So we are mindful of our cash balance. We ended the quarter at about $30 billion. It is possible that our cash balance is going to float up a little bit from there depending on what the market environment continues to look like. And we will continue conversations with our Board about the share repurchase program. But right now, we're just continuing to execute our plan. Operator : We will take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Darren, I wonder if I could just ask you to opine on a kind of big picture issue. You, I think, and a number of your peers met recently with the administration relating to a number of things. I mean I think the only folks are probably not happy with your results this morning might be -- well be the administration. Can you share any thoughts you had about some of the risks presented by legislators around things like export bans on products, things of that nature, not least given how strong your Downstream profitability was this morning? Darren Woods : Yes. Doug, I'm going to probably pass on trying to predict where different governments or administrations here in the U.S. are going to go with respect to policy. We've been very explicit, I think, me, along with many of the peers in the industry around what I would say are the mechanics and the fundamentals of our industry and how it works and the implications for some of the policies being considered.  And I would say that in the short term, it may solve a political problem, but it will carry all the policies that I've heard people talking about, the export bans in particular, windfall profit tax. Those will carry significant long-term negative consequences. And it's just a question of, I think, how they balance out the political equation versus what I would say are some of those fundamentals.  For me, personally, for the company, what I would say is I feel like we're well positioned. Obviously, it would be a disadvantage to the industry. But I think within that disadvantage, we would find, because of our footprint, because of our diversification, an ability to position ourselves competitively with whatever policy comes down the road. And so our focus is really making sure people understand what the potential consequences of some of these policies are being considered. And then in parallel with that, obviously, staying very focused on where I think the root cause or the root issue here is making sure that people all around the world and here in the U.S. get affordable and reliable energy. We recognize the pain that high prices cause. Unfortunately, the market that we're in today is a function of many of the policies and some of the narrative that's floated around in the past. And we basically have been working to make sure that when needed, when the products were required, which we anticipated, you'll recall back in 2020, we made the point that the industry is under-investing. We continue to lean in into the investments to spend at a rate higher than the rest of industry, so that when the call came, we would be there to answer.  And I think the results you've seen here in the third quarter is exactly that. Those investments are paying off. We've grown our production, both in the Upstream and are growing our production in Downstream and refining business with the expansion in Beaumont and then a real focus on reliability and high throughput. And so we keep trying to reiterate that, that we're doing what we can within the boundaries of what's available to us today. And then longer term, we are making the investments that's good for the administration's constituents and good for our business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Darren, I would love your perspective on M&A and just how you see that fitting into the go-forward framework and specifically, around upstream consolidation but also low carbon consolidation as you've said that you want to grow that business over time to be the size of the refining and chemicals business. Darren Woods : Sure. Neil, as you know, we've talked about this over the years quite a bit. And I would tell you that the whole M&A space and divestment space is something that we are constantly working. Obviously, our strategy, which you've seen us execute over the last several years is buy low, sell high. That's kind of what we're doing. We laid out a divestment program, but we took our time and were patient, waiting for market conditions to develop that would favor us as sellers. And that's what you've seen transacting here, likewise, as we look at acquisitions and opportunities constantly in the market, thinking about that and looking for it. But we've got to find opportunities where we can see a clear synergy and develop a clear competitive advantage so that we bring some unique value to the transaction. And we're evaluating and looking at that in our traditional business so I think with time, those will show up, but we'll be very selective and strategic around that. And I would say, we'll do it when the market conditions are favorable for doing that.  On the Low Carbon Solutions, I think longer term, the concept sounds good in terms of M&A. But I would just put that in the context of this is a very immature market. And so there aren't a lot of established businesses out there today that are -- have what it takes to be successful in this space. If you think about starting an industry from scratch and what's required in terms of policy regulation, investment, connecting all the different pieces of a brand-new value chain, that's a complicated equation and fortunately, one that we think plays to our strengths.  And the recent deal that we announced with CF Industries, for us really demonstrated that in terms of the complexity of putting together each element of that value chain to successfully come up with a deal that's value accretive and it generates profits. And it's good for the planet, it's good for our shareholders.  And so I don't know how much we'll see how that develops. I would think in the M&A space, we may, over time, see opportunities that we can uniquely leverage and then we'll bring those into the portfolio when they make sense to do that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Darren, I appreciate all the disclosure around the CF Industries project. I was wondering if you could talk about -- it probably comes as no surprise to anybody that you announced this shortly after the IRA was passed. But also, could you talk about what needs to happen on the policy side to kind of improve that abatement curve and kind of move more projects along?  And then also I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there's still some hurdles with permitting and -- do you see that at the local level, state level and where those might be? And then finally, if you could just address returns. How should investors think about the returns available on these projects, considering kind of policy and some of the risks around that versus some of the more conventional Upstream or Downstream projects? Darren Woods : Sure. Yes, maybe to start with the first point you made around the timing of that. While certainly, the IRA contributed to the value proposition there, I would say that, that project and that deal was being worked well before that and would work with the existing policy. It's been enhanced with the new policy, obviously.  And what I would just say with respect to what that IRA does, it essentially opens the aperture in terms of the CO2 that can be cost effectively captured or avoided. And if you think about the challenges associated with economic projects to capture and sequester CO2, really important variables in that would be the concentration of the CO2. The more dilute the CO2 stream, the more expensive the capturing step. And so you need greater incentives to catch more -- to capture more diluted streams, and so the IRA allows you more to economically pursue more diluted stream, so that opens up the opportunity space there.  Another really important variable is the distance to sequestration. And the transportation cost of moving CO2 to that. And so the further away you are from those, the sources are from the storage sites, the higher the cost. And again, the IRA helps with that space. And then obviously, there's some incentives for hydrogen and additional incentives for direct air capture. So I think directionally, those things are going to help. But I would also say that to achieve the ultimate objective in driving emissions down to net zero, you're going to need to capture a lot of diluted streams and the cost will be a lot higher. And so we're going to have to find additional incentives for that, whether it be through market forces and markets developing for CO2 or additional policy. With respect to what else has to happen, obviously, we're at the very early stages of this project where we've got the economic incentives laid out. We have a path forward but there's a lot to be done. We've got to get permits for storing the CO2. We've got some extensions to put on the pipeline. So there's other regulatory permitting steps that we have to take and the government -- we're working with the government to make sure that we can do that effectively so that we can expedite the project to get it online and start reducing those emissions. It's the equivalent of taking 700,000 cars off the road. So it's a fairly significant project in and of itself.  From a return standpoint, what I would say is, and we've talked about this before, we're insisting that the work we do here that we had positioned ourselves competitively versus the rest of industry and the thinking being that whatever incentives required for the marginal player out there to capture and store CO2 or develop biofuels or hydrogen, that we will leverage our advantages to drive a higher return. And to make sure that the projects that we bring into the portfolio are competitive in our portfolio. And that's exactly what we're doing and CF Industries is an example of that, an accretive project that's competitive in our portfolio, that makes us money while reducing CO2. And I would say there are more opportunities like that out there. And the thing that Dan is doing in his Low Carbon Solutions business is looking for the opportunities where we can bring something unique to bear and therefore, drive above-industry average returns. And we feel pretty good about the size of that opportunity set. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : My question is about your gas realizations, which are a huge driver on the quarter. Would you characterize those as contractual or more optimization-driven? And then this is an addendum, but I think the seasonality of the gas market has changed a little bit because Europe has very high demand in the summer now because of a storage imperative. And so I wonder if you see that as a structural change to the global gas market and if it means anything for your investment prerogatives on the LNG chain or even in the U.S. within gas because we're going to be exporting a lot. So that's the question. Kathryn Mikells : Yes, that's fine. I'll jump in, and Darren can add if he has anything. Overall, if you look at our results, we saw strong gas realizations, but we have an overall portfolio that's 60% gas, 40% LNG. The LNG tends to be tied to crude-related prices with a 3- to 6-month lag. So we're seeing the benefit of that lag now kind of coming through our results, and that really came through in the quarter. Overall, from a demand perspective, you're obviously seeing a really tight market. We saw in Europe, the building of inventory and how that has driven prices in Europe, building of inventory ahead of the winter. And so structurally, we would say there's going to continue to be a tight market until supply and demand comes into equilibrium, right, in that there's only 2 ways that happen, either more supply or reduced demand and supply, especially supply of LNG does take time to bring online. It isn't something that is just a spigot that can be turned on overnight.  The market is obviously responding to that. We obviously have projects that are bringing more LNG online. Darren mentioned Mozambique, the Coral project reaching first gas production. Recently, we've got Golden Pass, which is going to be coming online in 2024. So we have investments that will bring more capacity online, and the industry, obviously, is responding to this, but it is going to take some time. So I'd say as we look at that seasonality, we're always mindful of what's happening in terms of inventories and when inventories are being built or being drawn and what that means in terms of near-term market conditions. And so it's something we always keep an eye on. Darren Woods : Yes, I would just add, Sam. So once we get through this period where we're building inventories, we're short in supply and therefore, you've kind of lost some of that seasonality, that once we get to more of a balanced position, which I think is a couple of -- 3 years out, frankly, we'll start to see that seasonality show back up again when we're back in more stable markets.  Longer term, our view on gas has always been that's going to play a critical role and world economies for quite some time. And initially, it will go into power generation and back out coal. That's one of the big benefits of gas today. But longer term, as we continue to address emissions and the energy system transitions, gas can be used for ammonia and hydrogen along with carbon capture. And so you can find -- you can move into what I would say, a low emissions -- even lower emissions fuels and address the CO2. And I think gas is going to play an important role in that.  So I think our view hasn't really changed that there's going to be a fundamental need for gas for quite some time. And we're positioning ourselves to make sure that the portfolio of projects that we developed bring on natural gas on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. We're going to continue to be focused on making sure that we're competitive under any scenario, price scenario that we can envision out there. So that's how we're thinking about. That hasn't really changed, frankly. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Maybe just one quick clarification before I ask my question, which is the dividend raise you used to do, I think, with 1Q earnings the past couple of years, you've done with 3Q earnings. So is that a shift of timing or just any comments on that?  And then my question is just on the Chemicals outlook. As you mentioned, there has been some weakening in the market. Just wondering broadly how you see that market evolving in the next 6 to 12 months, supply -- additional supply coming online, additional demand weakness or will things get tighter? Kathryn Mikells : Yes, I'll take the quick question on the dividend. We would have raised the dividend at the same time last year. One of the things I would mention is this is the 40th consecutive year where we've had an annual dividend increase. But we don't have a specific timing determined in any given point of the year in terms of when we make this decision. We look at it over time. We're obviously focused on having a competitive, sustainable, growing dividend over time. We know how important it is to shareholders and roughly 40% of our shareholders are consumers, and we know those people are very much focused on the dividend. Darren Woods : Yes. On Chemicals, just as you mentioned, third quarter, we talked about softer demand, really saw that as a consequence of the COVID lockdowns in China. We're very aware of some of the impacts that COVID is continuing to have in China. Now that's going to be a big determinant of what we see happening in margins and kind of supply-demand balance going out in time. It's just how well China recovers from that and how quickly they can move out of these periods of lockdown and get their current economic activity moving back again. I think as you move outside of China, which is -- obviously, dominates demand out in Asia and move more west into the U.S. and Europe, I think Europe, obviously, with some of the energy challenges that they're facing, are going to have much slower economic activity than would be historical. So I expect to see some demand impacts coming from there.  And then in the U.S., I would just say it's kind of -- I would just characterize it more as uncertainty. I think some of the softness that we saw in the third quarter was driven by inventory draw for so many of our customers. And we typically see that when there's uncertainty about where future is going, positioning themselves for eventualities and making sure that they are covering themselves for potential downside.  So I think it's tough to tell. We'll have to see how the fourth quarter plays out. But in the short term, certainly, we see inventories coming down quite a bit. And then longer term, it will be a function of economic activity, obviously. Kathryn Mikells : And then just one other thing I'd mention, we certainly see some industry supply that's coming on in the fourth quarter, and we commented on that just in terms of our look-forward expectations. Operator : We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC Capital Markets. Biraj Borkhataria : I just wanted to ask about the LNG portfolio again. Could you clarify what proportion of your LNG sales are under long-term contracts and what proportion are sold on a spot basis? The reason I asked is because your assets are performing extremely well in Qatar, Papua New Guinea and Gorgon also. So I just wondered if that has allowed you to sell some incremental spot cargo. So what proportion is under long-term contract?  And if I could sneak a second one in, has there been a change to the 2022 Permian production kind of guidance in terms of growth? It looks slightly light relative to at least what I had in. So I was wondering if anything has changed there. Kathryn Mikells : So the commentary I had made is in our LNG portfolio, about 80% of our volumes would be under long-term contract and we're seeing the benefit of the timing lag because those contracts are typically -- the pricing is tied to crude, but it's lagged kind of 3 to 6 months. So we're seeing that benefit now coming through our realizations. Darren Woods : Yes. I would say on the Permian, one of the challenges there is over the years, what we've been doing is working really hard to make sure we're maximizing the recovery of that resource. And I think we've talked before about some of the technology that we're bringing to bear to make sure that we are doing that in the most cost-advantaged way. Obviously, as we go through that, we're optimizing and adjusting our development plans. That continues to be the case. So I expect this year, we'll probably come in at about 20% up on last year's growth, which was up 25% from the year before. So still very solid growth in the Permian.  And if you look more broadly, we expect basically to meet the objectives that we talked about at the beginning of the year on overall production. If you look at what we had talked about at the beginning of the year for total production this year and where we'll end up, the delta there of about 100,000 barrels a day is really all driven by price entitlements and the fact that we're in much higher price environment.  So we feel pretty good about the production growth that we're seeing across the portfolio. We've talked about the record production in the Permian and Guyana is obviously performing very, very well with both of those boats running at above capacity. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Kathy, can I come back to the -- I think, the very first question on energy products. And if we go back to the 8-K at the close of the quarter, you sort of suggested that industry margins would be a headwind of almost $3 billion. And today, your waterfall suggests that you've only really seen half of that. So I just want to understand, I mean, I don't recall there being ever as big a difference between new industry margins and the indicator margins and your realized margins. So what does it do you think about the portfolio that's allowing you to exceed that at such a degree? Kathryn Mikells : Yes. And our impact from, I'd say, straight up refining margins came in kind of right in the middle of the range that we provided for the 8-K. And so beyond that, I mentioned we're seeing a positive beyond refining margins and aromatics margins, overall revenue management. And then end-to-end supply chain optimization and efficiency, which would include trading profit benefits.  And so I'd say, if you look at quarter-to-quarter, what we've seen in energy products, during the year, there's been a lot of volatility that's been basically tagged to the moving price environment. If you look at that over a longer period of time, say, year-to-date, it looks, I would say, pretty normalized. And then we try to give you information on things that were price timing stuff that occurred in the quarter, but over time, we would expect to be pretty neutral.  And so I mentioned specifically the program that we have, that we use derivatives to basically ensure ratable pricing of refinery crude run. Over time, we'd expect that to be neutral. You would have seen in the price timing impacts that, that was about a $600 million favorable impact for the quarter. So I would say what goes on in terms of overall supply chain optimization and how we're trading around our physical footprint, doesn't come through our results ratably every quarter. This quarter, it was obviously a lot stronger. But if you look at it over a long period of time, that benefit that's embedded in the business clearly shows through. Alastair Syme : Do you think going forward in the 8-K, you would expect to be closer to that industry margin? Kathryn Mikells : It's really going to depend what the price environment is, what comes out of our trading portfolio in the fourth quarter. Obviously, I'd say, as you also looked at the overall benefits from the business, I'd say the big positive volume factor that we had was something that wouldn't get reflected in our 8-K because we had incredibly high throughput and utilization. So what I try to tell you is if you put the price timing impacts to the side, we would start at about $5 billion in profit in energy products, and then it's going to be about what the -- how the market unfolds in the fourth quarter. Darren Woods : Yes. I would just add to that the 8-K was really looking at what the market factors are. And then to the extent within the business, we're working hard to improve upon that through the optimization that Kathy mentioned through revenue management across that entire value chain and then trading. And as trading moves and with the accounting rules as that booking happens with time, that comes in less than ratable. We saw that in this margin bucket this quarter. And that will move around as we move forward depending on the price environment that we're in. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Most of mine were asked, but if you could just maybe talk about the status of the refinery strikes in France. I know you had a couple of facilities that were impacted there that I believe are ramping back up. Where are we now with those facilities? And when do you expect them back in full? And do you think it actually has a meaningful impact on your 4Q results for Downstream? Darren Woods : Yes. The -- so we reached an agreement with the workers some time ago and those refineries are basically going back through the start-up process. When those refineries strike, we've got to bring those units down and free them of hydrocarbon. And so that's a fairly thorough process of cleaning out the hydrocarbon -- clearing the hydrocarbon.  So when we go to bring those back up, it's a fairly rigorous process of starting those back up to make sure we do that safely. So it takes some time to ramp things back up again. That's what the organization is working on. I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact. I mean, obviously, in a market that's short, any capacity that comes offline raises the overall prices within the industry. And so I think net-net, that will probably -- there's some mitigation there with respect to our other refineries that are up and running. So I don't think we'll see that in the results, frankly. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe if I could follow up on the Permian and your activity levels there. The expectations for U.S. supply growth in 2023, I would say, have probably been falling a little bit across the board, at least partially because of constraints across service providers. As you look towards your 2023 program, how much do you anticipate stepping up activity levels in the Permian to achieve that program? And if the market supports it, is there appetite or interest or even ability on your part to accelerate further? So how much activity increase is based into the program? And how tight do you see the market there in terms of your ability to kind of move around that? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. Well, I think the point you make are good ones. The market is tight. And I think generally, the industry -- there's not a lot of capacity as you look across the different steps required to bring on additional production. So I think that is tight. That will, obviously, with time loosen up a little bit. But I think, generally speaking, for the industry, it's constrained. Obviously, every company will have different degrees of freedom in that space. We have some degrees of freedom there, but I would just say we're staying very firmly grounded in our philosophy of making sure that the investments that we make generate high returns at low prices.  And so the capital discipline -- my definition of capital discipline is making sure that you spend money that's advantaged and has -- generates good returns even in the down cycle. We're going to stay grounded in that. And so anything that we do on the margin has to, first and foremost, meet that criteria, that it's robust to a wide range of price environments, and that we'd be happy irrespective of what prices we're seeing out the window.  We've got capacity to do that, frankly, and some space. So we will, on the margin, spend money to -- where we can see an opportunity to bring that on. But I wouldn't say -- if you look at kind of the range of CapEx that we've provided over the years, we gave ourselves that range, obviously, anticipated movement not only within the year, but across from 1 year to the next. And so we feel pretty good that -- in terms of the ranges that we've provided, our plans going forward are still very consistent with those ranges. And Kathy will spend more time talking about that in December when she takes you through the plan that we will get endorsed with the Board next month. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Just curious that I don't actually record in the product, Exxon talked about trading is a major contributor to the result. Historically, I think the U.S. companies, such as you and tends to take a more conservative approach and trading compared to your European customers. So just curious, are we seeing the company having a somewhat change in the trading strategy going forward? Or that this is just a unique circumstance and that when we're talking about trading, what kind of trading are we referring to that is making a big contribution this quarter? Darren Woods : Yes. Paul, I'll touch on that, and if Kathy's got anything to add, I'll let her jump in on the back. But what I would say is, and I think we talked about this some years ago that we were -- when we moved to the value chain constructs, when we combined our fuels marketing organization with our refining organization and start looking at optimizing value all along the value chain, the trading organization became a much more relevant channel with respect to optimization.  And so at that time, so back in 2018, we made the decision to invest more in trading and to change the approach there to optimize, to act as an optimization tool along all of our assets. And you may recall, we talked about asset-backed trading. And that continues to be an important part of the Product Solutions business, and more specifically, the Downstream element of the business as well as our Upstream crude. And so that organization has grown with time and continues to perform that optimization function.  I think what you're seeing this quarter, in particular, is the point that Kathy made, which is with the way you account for trading, that can be kind of noisy quarter-on-quarter. And that if you look longer term, you can see the value kind of embedded within the businesses. And it is, I would say, very embedded within those businesses. So we don't break it out just because it is an asset-backed trading strategy. And therefore, the value derived through that, obviously, is through trading, but obviously, also through running all our refineries reliably, having the product and having the assets to support the arbitrages and the trade activities that under -- that create that value.  This quarter we saw with the way that the prices moved, a bigger chunk of it booked in the quarter. But I would just say, as you look at that over time, it is a meaningful contributor to the value equation in our Downstream value chain. Kathryn Mikells : Yes. And then the only thing I would add to that is we are trying to also tell you that there's some impacts that over time, we expect to be neutral. So the fact that we use derivatives to ensure ratable pricing of our refinery crude runs sometimes that's going to give us a positive in a quarter. Sometimes that's going to give us a negative in the quarter. Over time, it should be neutral. Darren Woods : That's why we've tried to break that out with the price timing. Paul Cheng : That's great. And Kathy, just curious that the trading also contributed to the strong natural gas price utilization that you record? Or that had nothing to do with that? Kathryn Mikells : We also have trading that we would be doing within our Upstream business. And so you can see that, some of those impacts reported in our results, but that, we have spot, I would say, exposure, and we do trade around that as well, very embedded in the business. It's not really as big a factor as what we would have seen, obviously, in energy products. Operator : We'll take our next question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : My quick question is just on costs. Specifically, could you all speak to your thoughts for 2023 on OFS inflation and other rising costs particularly in your 2 highest return areas, the Permian and Guyana? Darren Woods : Yes. I'll touch on that, Neal. I mean, obviously, we're subject to the same broad market forces that everyone is seeing out there and so inflationary pressures across a number of our sectors and activities. I think a couple of things. One is, as you will recall, as we went through the pandemic in the downturn, we were very -- took a very concerted effort to work with our contracting partners and the recognition that we would be back, that we would longer term, be running rigs and putting pipe in the ground. And so tried to enter into contracts that reflected that longer term objective, and that has helped manage some of the inflationary impacts and that we kind of set some contracts back in the downturn with a commitment to continue to spend money going forward.  And so that's been an offset. And then, of course, the organization, with all the changes that we've been making. Remember, we took our Upstream organization from 7 plus businesses down to 1 and organized very, very differently. We've centralized a lot of the functions, really trying to harness our scale and leverage the purchasing power that we have and then cut our costs out. So all those efforts to become more efficient and more effective in the marketplace and reduce costs are having a significant impact.  We mentioned in the earnings release that to date, we have $6.4 billion of structural savings versus 2019 and we're well on our way to meeting the objective we set by end 2023 of $9 billion in structural savings. So that's helping to offset some of those inflationary pressures. And then on top of that, with the centralized organizations and more effectively leveraging the scale, we're getting what I would call -- what we term as kind of short-term efficiencies, purchasing power, however you want to think about that, that we don't put in the structural bucket, but actually helps us to offset costs.  And so we've challenged ourselves to deliver on our expense budget for the year and to offset inflation. The organization is doing a pretty good job at that. I think we'll be within rounding with respect to that. And then next year, the organization is very focused on using the opportunities that have been created through the restructuring of our business to offset those inflationary pressures. And we're going to stretch ourselves to see how much of that we can do. Jennifer Driscoll : Katie, we have time for one more question. Operator : We'll take our last question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Maybe just to follow up on the capacity question that was asked earlier, but rather than just focus on services capacity in a particular region or something like that, Darren, I was curious, if you look at tightness, be it LNG, refining, et cetera, what do you think it takes? Or do you believe that the capacity exists for the world to move forward and do what it needs to do over the next, say, 2 to 3 years to add capacity? Or do you see it as a situation where there probably is a no other option but to curtail demand for some period of time? It's kind of a macro question, but you brought it up in the intro, and it's kind of picking at me here as to what's the way out of this maze. Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Roger. I think the industry has been historically pretty good at flexing on capacity to meet the demand. And so I'm optimistic that with time, the market -- and we've proven this, I think, over the years, that the markets will come back into balance, but it is a function of time.  I think in the short term, everyone will squeeze what they can. Certainly, you've seen us pushing as hard as we can to make sure that we're running reliably, and we're getting product to the marketplace to meet that need in the market. I know everyone else is trying to do the same. So I think that piece of it is sweating all the existing assets as hard as you can. It's going to help in the short term, but longer -- but more structurally, it's just a function of getting these projects developed and on track.  I mean fortunately for us, we've had a very healthy pipeline of projects that have been in work. And so it's not -- we're not out trying to find something to work on. We're basically focused on delivering the pipeline that we've got. And we're bringing on -- as we talked about, we brought in Coral floating LNG out of Mozambique this quarter. That's additional capacity. We're progressing investments in Papua New Guinea. We've got Golden Pass here in the U.S., that's progressing very large LNG export terminal that should come online in 2024. That's going to probably increase the exports out of the Gulf Coast by 20%. So I think the capacity is there. It's just a function of the time it takes to build these very significant projects.  And I would also tell you that if you look at on the crude side of the equation, we're making very good progress with the next poke into Guyana. We continue to believe we're going to bring that in a little bit early and we're progressing the ones after that. So I think the capacity is there. It's -- the challenge is executing efficiently so that you're getting -- you're spending your capital efficiently and then doing it in a way that brings it on an expedited fashion, which is what we're focused on doing. Kathryn Mikells : And then just the one thing I'd add is on the demand side, I think all companies that can are looking to conserve, especially LNG, so that it can be there for other use. So across our footprint in Europe, we've already kind of switched over 65% of our use of LNG to other fuel sources so that it can be there for other use. And I expect that other industry players are doing the same. Jennifer Driscoll : Thanks, Roger. Thanks, everybody, for your questions today. We will post the transcript of the Q&A session on our investor website early next week. Have a nice weekend, everyone, and let me turn it back to Katie to conclude our call. Katie? Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning everyone and welcome to ExxonMobil fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our fourth quarter earnings news release is posted in the same location and will be joined by the transcript, once it's available. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from his presentation. That will analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at about 8 :30 A.M. Central Time. During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, so we encourage you to read our cautionary statement on slide two. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to these comments is listed in our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Also, as a reminder, we posted our Advancing Climate Solutions report, Sustainability Report, and Energy Outlook online in mid-December. We reference them in today\u2019s presentation, and you can find them on our website under the Sustainability tab. Lastly, in the past we\u2019ve held an annual Investor Day in March. We won\u2019t be hosting an Investor Day in 2023. Last December, we laid out comprehensive plans for 2023 through 2027 as part of our Corporate Plan Update and the company is already executing on these plans. We\u2019ve been enjoying the higher level of investor engagement that we\u2019ve been having. We\u2019ll continue to seek your feedback, to host events that give you access to our leaders and insights on parts of the business that interest you, and to share with you information about the company and our plans on more of a real-time basis. With that, I'll hand it over to Darren. Darren Woods : Thanks Jennifer. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Before covering our 2022 results, I want to start by recognizing our people. Their hard work and commitment, not only to the company, but to meeting the critical needs of society, are what drove the strong results we reported this morning. Their work is not easy, whether it\u2019s achieving industry-leading safety, driving record levels of environmental performance, increasing production, offsetting run-away inflation, effectively responding to expropriations, or quickly recovering from winter storms, to name just a few of the challenges, our people delivered while, I\u2019ll add, continuing to manage significant, ongoing organizational changes. As I cover our results, I think you\u2019ll see why we, and the entire management team are so proud of their efforts. Of course, our results clearly benefited from a favorable market but, to take full advantage of the undersupplied market, our work began years ago, well before the pandemic when we chose to invest counter-cyclically. We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom. We continued with these investments through the pandemic and into today. This year, our improved asset portfolio, organizational changes, and strong operating performance came together to deliver industry-leading results; industry-leading earnings, cash flows, return on capital employed, and total shareholder returns. Excluding asset sales, we had our best cash flow performance since the merger. And, despite lower revenues, we delivered higher profits than 2012, our previous record year with a 400-basis point improvement in profit margin, reflecting upgrades to our product mix, structural cost reductions, and disciplined expense management. 2022 was also a year of strong progress across our five strategic priorities. Importantly, we\u2019ve continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian at a time when the world needed it most. We implemented a series of organizational changes to further leverage our scale and integration, improve effectiveness, and better serve our customers. We combined our downstream and chemical companies to form Product Solutions, the world\u2019s largest fuels, chemicals, and lubricants business. This new integrated business is focused on developing high value products, improving portfolio value, and leading in sustainability. We\u2019re also now supporting our businesses with corporate-wide organizations including projects, technology, engineering, operations, safety, and sustainability. We see further opportunities in supply chain, procurement, and finance. We continued to expand our Low Carbon Solutions business, recently signing the first-of-its kind customer contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons per year of CO2. This agreement, in a hard-to-decarbonize sector, highlights how ExxonMobil can leverage our advantages to help others reduce their emissions and build an attractive business with strong returns and significant opportunities for growth. The recent passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes both hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, further reinforces this. To that end, in December, we shared our plans to invest approximately $17 billion in lower-emission opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in our prior plan. We also made significant progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our existing operations and remain on track with our 2030 emissions reduction plans, including net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our unconventional operations in the Permian Basin by 2030. In addition to investing in industry advantaged projects, we took advantage of the strong markets to further high grade our asset portfolio with approximately $5 billion in divestments of non-core assets. CapEx was in line with our guidance. To further increase transparency, in 2022, we introduced three new reports; The Lobbying Report, which provides additional disclosure of our lobbying activities and expenditures; The Climate Lobbying Report, which provides details on our US activities at the federal and state level; and our Investing in People supplement, an addition to our updated Sustainability Report. Lastly, as I mentioned, the hard work of our people underpinned our success this past year, as it has done for decades. We build on this advantage every year by attracting and developing the best talent. This past year, we were once again recognized as top in industry for most attractive employer among US engineering students, an honor we\u2019ve received 10 years in a row. Our 2022 financial results, which led the industry, further confirmed the strength of the strategy we developed five years ago. We grew earnings to nearly $56 billion -- $59 billion excluding identified items; significantly outpacing peers. We delivered an industry-leading total shareholder return of 87% and a return on capital employed of 25%, our highest one-year ROCE since 2012. Cash flow from operating activities was nearly $77 billion, also leading the industry. This enabled us to reduce net debt to 5%, fortifying the balance sheet and positioning us to continue our strategy of counter cyclically investing. Our continued focus on leveraging scale and integration drove further efficiencies with nearly $6.9 billion in structural cost savings versus 2019, up from $5.3 billion at the end of 2021. We remain on plan to meet our target of $9 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2023. Consistent with our capital-allocation strategy, we continue to share our success with shareholders through a reliable and growing dividend. In 2022, we boosted the quarterly dividend by more than 3% and marked the 40th consecutive annual increase. Additionally, we increased our share repurchase program twice during the year. In total, we returned $30 billion to shareholders in 2022, including about $15 billion in dividends, which also led peers. These actions reflect the confidence we have in our strategy, the performance we\u2019ve seen across our businesses, and the strength of our company\u2019s future. We\u2019re proud of our people and their work to meet the evolving needs of society. As we advance our strategy and the and equation, we\u2019re committed to sharing their progress. Consistent with this, we continue to enhance our disclosures and increase transparency. In December, we updated several important online publications. Our latest Sustainability Report describes the 14 focus areas where we believe our company can have the most impact. The Advancing Climate Solutions 2023 Progress Report outlines our approach to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of a net-zero future. It includes updated resiliency modeling under the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, including the addition of carbon and pricing assumptions, and an audit statement from Wood Mackenzie. In addition, it includes a discussion on the value of a life-cycle approach to measuring company specific emissions vs. Scope 3 targets. We believe a life-cycle approach for companies is more aligned with the principles of ESG, better reflects a company\u2019s efforts to reduce society\u2019s emissions, and avoids the negative consequences of a company-specific Scope 3 target. The update also contains more information on how we\u2019re driving reductions in methane emissions. And finally, it includes a look at the role of plastics in the energy transition, and how we\u2019re expanding our capacity for advanced recycling to help address the issue of plastic waste. Separately, we\u2019ve updated our outlook for energy, which is our latest view of energy supply and demand through 2050. It forms the basis for our business planning. In addition to assessing trends in economic development, technology advances, and consumer behavior, our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate-related government policies, which often target specific sectors. We encourage you to read these publications to gain a better understanding of how we\u2019re working to be a leader in the energy transition. They\u2019re available on our website under the Sustainability tab. Our plan for 2023 remains anchored in our existing strategy and builds on our continuing success. I\u2019ll wrap up by highlighting a few key areas. Critically, we\u2019ll continue our efforts to lead the industry in safety, operating, and financial performance. We\u2019ll continue to profitably grow the business through advantaged investments to meet the world\u2019s evolving needs and reduce emissions. We\u2019ll further leverage our new organization to fully realize our advantages in scale and integration and improve competitiveness. We expect to deliver another $2 billion in structural cost reductions, meeting our target of $9 billion in savings versus 2019. We\u2019ll look to capture additional organizational synergies by consolidating our supply chain activities and centralizing a majority of our finance and procurement operations. This will help us take better advantage of our scale and greatly improve our customer, vendor, and employee experience. We anticipate 2023 capital and exploration expenses of $23 billion to $25 billion. This includes investments in the next development in Guyana, and increased spending in US unconventional assets. It also includes advancing our China chemical complex and numerous emission reduction opportunities. We\u2019ll advance our work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity in our operated assets and help customers reduce theirs focusing on hard to decarbonize sectors. We\u2019ll continue to progress our blue hydrogen project in Baytown, that consists of a billion cubic foot per day blue hydrogen plant, the world\u2019s largest, and a CCS project with potential to store up to 10 million metric tons of CO2 per year. We\u2019ll also leverage our recent success in Louisiana to grow the customer base for our Low Carbon Solutions business. As the energy system evolves, our focus on the fundamentals and investments in an integrated but diversified portfolio of advantaged businesses will play a crucial role in capturing value and outperforming competition irrespective of the pace or path of the transition. As you\u2019ve seen, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities : investing in advantaged projects, maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage across the commodity cycles, and sharing our success through shareholder distributions. We\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment to a reliable and growing dividend and further sharing our success through the share repurchase program with up to $35 billion in cumulative repurchases in 2023 and 2024. 2022 demonstrated the importance of the and equation and the strength of our strategy. We feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made and even better about the opportunities ahead. With that, let me call over to Jennifer. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Dan. Now, let's move to Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. With that, Jennifer, please open up the lines for our first question. Operator : Thank you, Ms. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jeanine Wai with -- I apologize. We\u2019ll go first to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. Two things. First on your comment Darren on runaway inflation. Obviously, the Permian gets a lot the headlines there. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the offshore environment, ExxonMobil is one of the most active in the space there. So, I just want to get a sense of what you're seeing inflation in offshore? And then second question is on CapEx and I probably shouldn't do this. But if I take the 4Q numbers and annualize them, it would be above the 2023 guide, obviously I have to adjust for a little bit seasonality there. But I would have thought you'd be adding growth CapEx 2023 versus 2022, plus you have the inflationary pressures as you mentioned. How much contingency is there in the 2023 CapEx guidance? And what are the risks there, the upside or downside? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes, good morning Biraj. Let me start with your last question and then move to the first. With respect to CapEx, if you look at the range we've given, I think we've indicated in the comments and I just -- the comments I just made that we'll be at the upper end of that range, which is consistent with a slight increase given the work that we're doing. But I would reiterate that the broader range that we've given over the years continues to fit well with our plans and is consistent with the pacing that we established when we came out of the pandemic. As I mentioned before, we had worked with our contractors to lay out a plan for how we continue to progress those investments. And I would tell you today with our projects organization feel really good about the progress we're making, the efficiencies that we're gaining with our CapEx. If you look at the pause that we had to take due to the pandemic, we basically offset any of those costs to maintain the same level of productivity of our spend going forwards. So, something real proud of the projects organization is doing. So, I would expect to continue to stay within that range. And if that changes, obviously, in the years to come, we'll update you as our plans develop and make sure you all stay aware of that. With respect to the inflation, I would say, from an operating expense standpoint, one point I'd make is if you look at what the organization did year-on-year, essentially, with all the synergies that we are capturing, some of the scale advantages and purchasing power we had, essentially, the businesses collectively came in on plants. We're able to offset the inflation that we were seeing from an expense standpoint, which was obviously no easy task. I think on the -- if you look at the different projects around the world, it really is a function of when we chose to engage the contractors and engage the equipment that we're using. I mean, if you look at the Permian, it's the short cycle and where there's a lot of activity. And so like other parts of our business, supply and demand gets tight and puts pressure on pricing, there's less of that supply/demand pressure in other parts of the business and so not seeing the same kind of pressure that we're seeing in the Permian, that tends to be the one area that's really, really hot. But I think in all those areas, we're using the size of the business that we have and the long-term plans that we have and long-term commitments that we can make with our contracting partners to make sure that we're keeping those in check and that our partners are playing the long game here with us. So, I think we've done a pretty good job of keeping capital productivity pretty high, feel pretty good about that. Kathy, anything you want to add? Kathryn Mikells : Just the other thing I would add is I'd really caution you about taking the fourth quarter CapEx and exploration expense and kind of annualizing it because we tend to run a bit higher in the fourth quarter and the expenses and kind of prorated over the years. Overall, 2022 came in right about where we expected it. And when we talked about our Corporate Plan in December, we said we expect it to be at about $23 billion to $25 billion in 2023. And that we expected to see a little bit of an increase year-over-year, in part because Payara has been pulled forward, so we have a little more spending there. China One is starting to spool up and obviously, our emission plans are also spooling up. So, right now I'd say we're very consistent with our expectations and the guidance that we've given you. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay. Thank you for the color. Darren Woods : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Darren Woods : Good morning Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning Kathy, good morning Darren. Questions on the downstream which was a nice positive in 2022. And how do you think the EU embargo on Russian product imports on February 5th will impact your refining margins? And I guess what we're thinking is that there's a number of moving pieces between your refining footprint, particularly in the Gulf Coast and Europe and then there's potential tailwinds for diesel margins as Russian exports dissipate. But there's also probably need to take into account the likely incremental tightness in [BTO] (ph) supplies? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes, I'll take that Jeanine. I think -- start with just the market in general and I think the driver behind the refining margins that we've seen here of late is driven by the pandemic impacts of shutting down capacity and then not having that capacity available as demand has recovered. So, the world remains pretty tight and it will stay I think tight, while we wait for additional refinery expansions to come online, primarily out in Asia and the Middle East. I think the Russia impact and the ban on products going into Europe could potentially have some short-term implications. At the end of the day that -- those products are going to be needed. So, it really is around logistics, I'll call it, disoptimization to where the market is pretty efficient and we've got the most efficient supply chains and logistics systems lined out. We're going to disrupt those and I think it's a question of how does that disruption manifest itself in the market and what kind of disconnects and discontinuities do you see in the short-term? And then ultimately, we'll read that -- the system will stabilize, reoptimize and I expect higher costs just because of your moving to a less optimum logistics approach, but more stable. I don't know -- that's -- that -- I see how that\u2019s going to play out. So, I don't think there'll be a long-term impact, it'll be a short-term one and then there's just a question how long it takes for the systems to rebalance. I think more fundamental to refining is the shortness and with the economies picking up and with China coming out of its COVID lockdown and the economic growth there and then the view that you take on the economic impacts and how severe recessions are here this year, that's probably going to play a much bigger role. If demand picks up, economies continue to grow, we're going to see that tightness manifests itself and continued higher refining margins, which I think will mean a fairly high margins this year and potentially going into 2024 as well. Jeanine Wai : Great. Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thank you, Darren and Kathy. I wanted to spend some time on the Permian outlook for 2023, you made some comments in the prepared remarks about getting to over 600,000 barrels a day. So, I guess that's about 10% growth as we think about 2023. But just your thoughts on volumes and then ultimately, where should we think about plateau? Darren Woods : Yes, thanks, Neil. I would take you back to 2018 when we were talking about our strategy in the Permian and we've said at that time, our plan was to grow to 1 million barrels a day of production by 2025. When the pandemic hit, we basically said, there's going to be a delay in a lot of our plans and pushed out those objectives by about two years. So, moving from 2025 to 2027. If you'll look at my comments and the plans, we're now forecasting that our Permian production will reach about 1 million barrels a day by 2027. So, very much in line, going all the way back to 2018. And then the comments that we made around the pandemic and the delay that I was introducing. So, I think that's the context to think about what we're doing in the Permian and that development. If you look at 2021, we added about 90,000 barrels a day of production. 2022, very similar number, 90,000 barrels a day. And that in part was what I'd call, the organic development and drilling into production as well as clearing our DUCs inventory. So, as we were in the pandemic, obviously, not a lot of incentive to bring production on and so we concentrated our spend on drilling. And then as we got into higher-priced environments, concentrated on clearing that inventory and bringing those wells to production, and so we were bringing our DUC inventory down. As we go into next year, we're going to rebuild that inventory, get to an optimum level that we can then use and maintain as we go through the next several years. So, that's kind of a strategy of how we're working out. If you think about, ultimately getting to 1 million barrels a day by 2027, that's roughly at 13% compounded annual growth rate. That's going to -- that's not going to be steady every year, that'll kind of fluctuate, call it, plus or minus 5%. That's kind of order of magnitude how we'll see that playing out. And any one year's production will be a function of the development plans we have and how those development plans manifest themselves in that specific timeframe. But I think bottom-line is we're basically on plan moving at the pace that we anticipated. And I'm hopeful that as we continue to focus on the technology developments and continuing to improve efficiency, we'll see either that production bottom-line with more effectively at lower cost, or in fact, more productivity and higher production. But that's a function of the ongoing work we've got to bring our technology and operational capabilities to bear in the Permian continue to improve what we're doing there. Neil Mehta : Thanks Darren. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Darren Woods : Morning. Devin McDermott : So, I wanted to ask about the Chemicals business and if we look at the margin chart that you have in the slide deck, it's the one part of the portfolio where margins are still below the 10-year range. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends that you're seeing there as you move into early 2023 with China reopening and that potentially being a positive driver for margins. And then also just talk through some of the discrete growth projects we got coming on over the next few years to drive that that earnings growth you talked about at the Investor Day last year, I think Baytown, you noted later this year and get the China Chemicals Complex still a few years out, but some of the growth projects and the progress there as well? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. I think maybe just take both sides of the equation with Chemicals. I'll start with the demand side of the equation, which you referenced and you're right. I think one of the things we saw last year was with the China lockdowns and the lack of growth in China, which is a big, as you know, chemical market that that had an impact on the demand side of the equation. My expectation as we move into this year and the China economy continues to open up, we'll see that demand pick back up again. And then again, a function of whether how deep and how widespread the recessions are around the world, that's going to have an impact. If current conventions and thinking holds and recessions are milder than people anticipated, I think that'll see a benefit in the chemical on the demand side as well. From a supply side, which is a big part of what's suppressing margins today, as we came out -- went into the pandemic, there were a lot of chemical projects that got put on hold and deferred investments. And you're now seeing as we came out of the pandemic and you look at margins in 2021, 2022, very strong chemical margins, we saw those investments get leaned into and a lot of that capacity coming online. So, we've got this a large capacity additions coming on at the same time where we've had some demand slowdown. So, I think what we're seeing play out here is that what I would say is the typical supply/demand swings in that commodity cycle exacerbated somewhat by the effects of the pandemic, still kind of playing itself out, but not inconsistent with what we had anticipated coming out of the pandemic. And so it'll be -- it'll take a little time for that demand to pick up and fill that capacity, but it will get back on the growth trajectory, markets will get tight again. So, that's how we're thinking about the Chemical business. With respect to our projects, feel really good about -- we had to pause those, as you know coming out of the pandemic where we had to make some tough choices about how we spend our capital. We'd never done that before in terms of stopping some projects in midstream. But I again, I'll tell you the organization did a great job of putting those on pause, preserving where we're at, continuing to work with contractors to drive efficiency, and now we're bringing those back on basically in line with the plans that we've laid out in the pandemic. We just brought on the polypropylene unit in Baton Rouge. We've got our Baytown Vistamaxx, and LAO projects, which we anticipate coming on here middle of this year, and then China One is making really good progress and expect that to come on in 2025. So, I think all those investments we feel really good about and are on the path that we had anticipated. Devin McDermott : Great. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Good morning Darren. Darren Woods : Morning Doug. Doug Leggate : I don't know what show whether you -- or Kathy, which one of you two would like to take this, but I want to ask you about your treatment of the European windfall taxes. I'm understanding as you are, I guess suing to try and get some resolution there and treating these as non-recurring. So, can you can you walk us through your rationale versus how your peers are thinking about this? And any cash impacts that you had to incur in the current quarter I guess, would be my clarification question? But thank you for taking my question. Kathryn Mikells : Sure. So, I'll first I'll first just talk about the financial impacts. In the current quarter, we wouldn't have had material impacts. Obviously, there were some countries in Europe that had passed incremental taxes earlier this year. So, I'll point to Italy and the UK, as an example. And so we would have been accruing those appropriately. You would have seen as part of our identified items that we booked $1.8 billion associated with 2022. Overall, increased additional European taxes. Now, in terms of the cash impact that doesn't really hit in 2022, we just took the we took the overall accrual and those payments will end up occurring both in 2023 and in 2024. It just depends on the individual countries. But if I take an overall step back and say we looked at what happened in the EU and said, it's not legal and it's the opposite of what is needed, right. So, what's needed right now is more supply and instead, what's been put in place is a penalty on the broad energy sector. So, I'll contrast that with what's happened more recently in the United States with the Inflation Reduction Act, right. There you see policy that's put out to incent industry, both to accelerate technology and decelerate investment, that's greatly needed, especially in areas where the industries in terms of lowering emissions are still pretty nascent, things like hydrogen and CCS, and you're already seeing investment start to flow into those industries. Darren Woods : And I would just add, Doug, I think, obviously, we're -- we've been engaged with governments throughout Europe. And I do think there is a sensitivity to the impact on future investments and industries' appetite to continue to invest in what is a challenging market environment in the first place with respect to Europe, becoming more uncertain and less stable. So, I think there was some concern going into this and my suspicion will be many in industry, this will be yet another reason to pull back on their investments in Europe. And I'm not sure you're going to then see that begin to propagate around the world just because of the negative impact it has on an industry that requires stable policy and some certainty when you're making the size of investments that the industry makes over the time horizon that we make them in. So, my sense is that there will be a lot of unintended negative consequences that come from this and as that manifest itself, a lot less appetite for doing this. Doug Leggate : Appreciate your perspectives, guys. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Thanks very much Darren and Kathy. Darren could you just make some sort of high-level comments about the competitive landscape you see across the business? I know this is sort of a broad question, but upstream Energy Products, Low Carbon Solutions, how do you see competitors' behavior [ph]? Darren Woods : Sure, yes, this is obviously a real important focus area for us. And I may just maybe start with a broad strategy and philosophy that you've seen us executing here over the last five years. And as I mentioned on CNBC this morning, I think we see that paying off with respect to the profit margins and the improvements that we're seeing in the profit margins. If we look at 2012, when we had extremely -- our last -- higher revenues than we've got today, we made more money this year with less revenues and that's really a function of the improvement in net profit margin, where we went from about 10% net profit margin in 2012 to 14% in 2022. So, I think a reflection of the work that we've been doing to better position ourselves competitively. If I go down each of the sectors that we're in, I'll start with the upstream where our emphasis has really been making sure that our -- projects that we're pursuing are advantage versus industry and very importantly, are on the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. So, our strategy there is we can't call the cycles, we can't predict where the markets will go and over what timeframe. But we can control the cost of the barrels that we're bringing on and making sure that irrespective of the environment that we find ourselves in, that we are competitively positioned, versus our competition, that and that our barrels are lower cost. And that's been the strategy and then for the portfolio, where we don't see some of those advantages is to exit those businesses in the hybrid portfolio. That's what we've been doing. I think you're seeing the benefits of that. We've also been very focused on kind of leaning in when others lean out to use the language I used in the press release and that that I think, is paying off as well. And I think resource owners around the world recognize our commitment to that industry and our capabilities with respect to effectively producing barrels. So, I think that's what we're doing there, I think we're very well-positioned. We got a really good portfolio, I think, competitive advantage portfolio. And not only in the cost of supply, but in the quantity and the quality of the projects that we've got there. In the Chemical business, it's really around focused on performance project -- products and making sure that we're leveraging our technology to develop products that have a high value to customers and therefore a higher margin. We build world-scale facilities, start them out on commodity grades, and then quickly upgrade those and fill -- transition to performance products. That strategy continues to play out well. We're continuing to see a lot of poll on our performance products and so that's our strategy there and we continue to invest in that high-end high-value product slate in the Chemical business. In refining, it's really around evolving the yield and the products that we make in our plants. I think contrary to maybe some of the conventional wisdom out there, we actually think the refineries that we're investing in position as well for again, a very uncertain future continuing to make the products that society meets needs today and doing that across a very diversified slate of products. So, think chemicals, fuels products, and lubricants. And then at the same time investing to produce low emissions fuels to address the low carbon demand. And as that piece of the market picks up, we've got a really good competitively advantaged base to shift that production. And you see us doing that the Strathcona project is one example. But we have many, many other concepts in mind to transition, our refinery production in line with that demand evolution. And it's really just a function of pacing. And again, I think that advantages versus the rest of competition, big refining footprint that's going to be needed for these heavy advantaged in making low emissions fuel. So, I think we're well-positioned there. Our Chemical business is well-positioned with the technology and the performance products that were making. So, think we've got a leg up in that space. And then finally low carbon solutions, there's a lot of activity in this space, a lot of interest, particularly with the IRA here in the US. But more generally, around the world, I think, a real focus on low carbon opportunities. I think we're very well-positioned there. This is not a game for startups. This is -- these are large world-scale projects that require the kind of project expertise that we have require the kind of size and balance sheet capacity that we have, requires the technology and operating experience that we have. So, there's a lot of, I'd say, skills and capabilities needed in this market that lend themselves and are consistent with our capabilities and advantages. So, I think it'll take a while for that to shake out, but I am convinced that we are very well competitively positioned in the low carbon solutions business. And if you think about security of supply and counting on your partner to say sequester carbon for 100 plus years, I think you're going to want somebody who's been around for a while and knows how to do that. I think we're the company to do that. If you want somebody who's going to guarantee that when they say they're going to have the barrels available to you, they're there. I think people will look to ExxonMobil to deliver on that. I feel pretty good about our position as well. Alastair Syme : Thanks very much. Darren Woods : Thank you, Alastair. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI Stephen Richardson : Thanks. Couple for Kathy, if I may. One is wondered if you could just address the balance sheet and how we're thinking about the differences in the cycle. So, obviously, significant deleveraging and at 5% net debt to cap, I know that's not your target, but it is notable. So, just wondering if you could address at what point do you start to think of the balance sheet as a bit of a drag and also your willingness to kind of continue to delever here acknowledging that there was a long time in the corporation's history where the balance sheet was effectively unlevered? Thank you. Kathryn Mikells : So, I would start by saying we view our balance sheet very much as a competitive advantage, right and we know that during the upper part of the cycle, we've got to build a fortress balance sheet, to make sure we have all the firepower we need, and all the flexibility we need to then manage the downturn, which will inevitably come. So, that's how we think about the balance sheet. I think we've made terrific progress. I mean, if you look overall, this year, we paid down about $7 billion of debt, you already mentioned that our net debt to cap is about 5%. We obviously also learned a number of lessons during the pandemic and we have said, we have a willingness to carry a higher cash balance. Our cash balance is around $30 billion right now. So, I'd say overall, at any given point in time, our cash balance is ultimately going to depend on how the market environment ensues. But we know having a really strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage for us. We've been very clear about our capital allocation priorities and at the very top of that priority list is making sure we're consistently investing in advantaged projects, right. We're in a quite good position in terms of having a very rich portfolio of advantage projects, which we're bringing forward. And I think we've taken a very balanced approach and ultimately how we're sharing our rewards with shareholders in 2022, we ended up distributing about $15 billion in dividends and $15 billion in a share repurchase program. So, ensuring that we just have sustainable growing competitive dividends and efficiently returning cash to shareholders. So, that's how we think about it. And we are at the part of the cycle where you would expect us to see a very strong balance sheet, and we're very focused on ensuring that that's indeed what we have. Operator : We'll got next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Darren Woods : Morning Sam. Sam Margolin : I'll ask about M&A actually, because you're describing a number of advantages that are that are very unique to ExxonMobil, not just at a corporate level, but even in individual asset classes, for example, that you might be in the early stages of efficiency and productivity gains in the Permian, which is really different than a lot of other operators are saying. So, it seems like a opportunity to consolidate and create a lot of value, but at the same time, there's other countervailing forces against that. So, maybe at this point, it would be it'd be great to just hear your thoughts on the overall M&A landscape and what kind of opportunities you see? And then also in the context of Kathy's comments on the balance sheet, which is obviously set up very well right now. Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes, sure. Thanks Sam, I'll touch on that and maybe -- see if Kathy has got anything to add. I think the point that you make is exactly the right one, which is looking at where we can take advantage of our capabilities and skills to bring additional value to acquisition targets. And that's really where we put our focus is where can we leverage what we what we're good at and bring value above and beyond what potential acquisition would be able to do without us. That's the focus area. And I think we are in the area that you talked about, we do think with time, the work we've been doing in the Permian will provide a value opportunity that we can leverage when we win the markets, right. And I think expectations start to align around values from a buyer standpoint, as well as a seller standpoint. And so there's an element of that where it's difficult to go in and buy at the top of a commodity cycle. You tend to want to -- at least I want to focus in on when you when you see more, I'd say longer term price cycles being priced into assets, that'll be one of the functions or one of the things that you've got to consider in this space. But it really is we continue to look for where we see the opportunity of bringing value for undeveloped resources in the Permian. I think in a Low Carbon Solutions space, it's a very early business, there aren't a whole lot of opportunities there in that space, but with time that could develop and, obviously, it's challenged in the Chemical space with respect to the technology that we bring to bear on existing assets, but it's something that we continue to look at. Kathy anything to add there? Kathryn Mikells : The only other thing I would add is ultimately, we're focused on continuing to high-grade our portfolio overall. And you would have seen in the past year, in what's been a more buoyant market environment, you know that we've made a number of divestments where others saw more value in those assets than we saw. So, we're always looking at both sides of this equation. And depending on the market and what's available, and again, how we think about synergies, how we think about retention value, we'll look to transact, but only when we think it's going to earn good return for our shareholders. Sam Margolin : Thank you so much. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason Gabelman with Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Morning, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is for Kathy, just on a couple of items that I think impacted 4Q earnings. You had highlighted on the last earnings call that downstream trading benefits were particularly strong in 3Q and I was wondering if that continued into the fourth quarter? And you also highlighted in the 8-K for 4Q earnings that inventory impacts would be a headwind and that was hoping if you could quantify that as well? Thanks. Kathryn Mikells : Yes. And so we obviously in the third quarter quantified that we had a number of favorable timing impacts that we didn't necessarily think we're going to repeat. So, what when you think about Energy Products performance in this quarter, you should think about the absence of some of those positives that we had overall last quarter, right. So, if I look at that just on a quarterly basis, overall, we had from third quarter to fourth quarter in Energy Products, unsettled derivatives of about $1 billion as a headwind, that's really the absence of largely a positive that we would have had in the third quarter. And then again, in the third quarter, we talked about the fact that we have a program associated with achieving ratable pricing in our refinery runs and that had given us, again, I'll call it benefit in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, price timing differences were negative to the tune of about $400 million. I think the most important thing, though, is to actually take a step back and look at the full year results because what we've told you during the year is, look, we're going to have these price timing impacts, especially mark-to-market on open derivative, positions are going to move around quarter-to-quarter and during the year. But if you looked at Energy Products on a full year basis, our unsettled derivatives were basically neutral, right? And price timing impacts, and again, I would have referred to this coming largely out of our priced inventory program, were about a $400 million negative when we look at just 2021 to 2022. So, like we have said all along, the quarter-to-quarter impact may be a little bit more volatile. But when you look at the full year results, it tends to settle itself out. Jason Gabelman : Got it. And then on the inventory, the year-end inventory impacts? Kathryn Mikells : If you looked at overall year-end inventory impacts, they would have had the biggest impact in our Upstream business. And as part of the inventory adjustments we made, we had to look at gas inventories overall in Europe with prices declining pretty significantly. If you looked at our overall year-end adjustments to inventory outside of that, I would have called them kind of neutral to modestly favorable with the largest favorability incurring in Energy Products. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks. And then my follow-up is just on downstream maintenance, which it seems like refining maintenance will be particularly high in 1Q. I wonder if that's just kind of a bunch of things getting -- just getting aggregated into one quarter, if it's going to be a higher year overall moving through the year, if there's something else going on. Just a little more color on that number and the outlook for the year would be great. Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes, I'll take that one. I would just say turnaround timing is really a function of -- and the spend that we have in that area is really a function of the mix and the units that we're bringing in at the different -- into turnarounds around the different refineries and the age of those units. And so I wouldn't take away some structural change or outlook for the year. It's really just a function of which refineries and which units that those refineries are coming into turnaround and the work that we have to do to get those units back on their maintenance schedule. So, that's what's happening there. Jason Gabelman : Great. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Hey thanks. Maybe a higher-level question, following up on some of your comments earlier on competitive position. Relative to past cycles, the competitive environment in upstream oil looks far different than many times in the past with both fewer players in the industry and many of your largest peers strategically under-investing in oil. How does it -- how do you think this impacts global supply over time? And how does it impact your -- as you look forward, how does it impact your competitive position within the space? Does it open the door for additional opportunities for you? And in E&P projects, does it -- whether in terms of expiration leasehold, competition or project development or even within the asset transactions in the M&A space, have you seen an impact to-date? And how do you think that evolves in the coming years with the changed competitive landscape? Darren Woods : Yes, thanks. I'll take that one, Ryan. It's -- I think you hit on a very good point, which is -- and the point that we've made historically is there has -- we are under-investing as an industry in this space. And in the depletion business, we are not keeping up with that depletion or not offsetting it and covering the growth. You find yourself in tight markets. And I think as the broader public narrative has moved in this space and some of our competitors have stepped back for investment there, that does tighten the amount of capacity that's coming on and the supply that gets brought in on over time. And until you have competitive alternatives, lower emissions, competitive alternatives that address the full set of needs for society, there's going to continue to be a demand for oil and gas and oil products. And so I think you're seeing the potential for continued tight markets. I think we have found, certainly over the last five years, that our continued commitment to strengthening the capabilities that will allow us to bring on competitively sourced oil and gas and do that in an environmentally responsible way, that, that has resonated and is being recognized by resource owners around the world. And so I do think that does give us a bit of an advantage with respect to the opportunity set. And I would say that we continue to work to earn the advantage by developing those resources very effectively, bringing projects on ahead of schedule, under budget and doing things that, frankly, some of our competitors are challenged to do. And so I think it's a very supportive environment that we find ourselves in. The focus that we have in this space, I think, is appreciated and gives us an advantage versus the rest of the competition. And I'll also add that we're doing that while, at the same time, balancing the risk of the transition and investing in the low emission side of the equation. And so we've got this unique position where the same core capabilities that we're using to drive value in our traditional businesses, we're using those and leveraging them to drive value in the Low Carbon Solutions business and keeping a very keen eye on the developments in all those industries and making sure that we adjust our investments in our strategy and our allocation of capital based on the developments that we're seeing in those space. So, we've got optionality and we've got flexibility. And we've got a core set of competencies that lend themselves to every part of that -- of those businesses and across our portfolio. So, I feel really good about that. And I think the folks that were out there or the partners that we're looking to partner with recognize that and value it. So, I think we'll see that manifest itself in the deals that we continue to do and the businesses that we continue to grow. Ryan Todd : Thanks Darren. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hey guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on the Beaumont expansion and how the ramp is going there. And in terms of profitability, we've got Midland trading above Cushing now, but that's probably not significant given diesel cracks are very, very strong. So, just wondering on the profitability of that project out of the gate relative to how you've been thinking about it when you sanctioned? Darren Woods : Yes, I'll take it. As I said before, if you look at Beaumont, when we -- the concept of that project was developed five-plus years ago. And it really was looking at what I would call the feedstocks and intermediate balances going into that refinery and the options that we had to optimize the logistics piece of the equation and justified that project purely on logistics optimizations and lower-cost transportation to feed that refinery. And that's kind of how we thought about that, so that is robust to wherever you're at within the cycle. If you layer on where we're at today in the commodity cycle and the fact that we are at on the very high end of refining margins, my expectation is that that refining expansion will do much, much better than what we -- the basis on which we appropriate it just because we find the timing of where we find ourselves in that cycle. And that's good news. I mean that's, I think, an important part of the investments that we make to make sure that we're kind of participating in all phases of the cycle. But I think even better news is we're not depending on that to generate a return from that investment. So, even as we move through the commodity cycle and at some point in the future, we find refining margins start to come off, and eventually, we'll find ourselves in the bottom of the refining commodity cycle. That expansion will position our Beaumont refinery very well and will, I think, continue to be incremental to the value of that refinery. So, feel really positive about that. We're making good progress. We mechanically completed that a little ahead of schedule, and we're making good progress on ramping that facility up. Jennifer Driscoll : We have time for one more question. John Royall : Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : Looks like we have time for one more question. Our last question will be from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes, thank you and good morning. Glad you're able to port me in here. Just wanted to follow-up on Guyana. I think there was a lot of expectation at the Investor Day -- well, won't be an Investor Day, but there'd be a potentially big update on Guyana. I know things are going well there from a development standpoint, but I was just hoping you could address anything on the resource side and any update at all from a PSC political side, there's been a little noise out there on that end? Darren Woods : Yes, I think the point you made, we're making really good progress. As we've said, we brought Liza 2 in ahead of schedule. We anticipate bringing Payara in ahead of schedule. We brought Liza 2 up very well, brought that online quickly and began producing at above nameplate capacity in the fourth quarter. And so I feel really good about the quality of those projects and the operational ability to bring those up and run them effectively, making good progress there. We've got Yellowtail in for government approval. I expect that to be a bigger FPSO. So, we're making -- I would say we're at or ahead of the schedule and ahead of the expectations that we've talked about historically with Guyana. The resource base, as you know, continues to grow. We continue to make discoveries. We continue to really optimize around those discoveries. And that's a really big part of developing these projects is as we are in parallel to developing projects, continuing the exploration and then continuing to better quantify and qualify that resource base is making sure that our projects are optimized around that. So, there's a balance that we're striking around how best to optimize, and feel good about what we're doing there. And frankly, I think the government feels really good about what we're doing there. Importantly, the development of that resource and the value associated with that is manifesting itself in the country, which is a really important part of the equation here. We always said coming into this that this has to be a win-win-win proposition, needs to be a win for the company, it needs to be a win for the government of Guyana and it needs to be a win for the people of Guyana. And that's what we're seeing there, a lot of jobs, a lot of economic opportunity opening up in Guyana. We've just -- we've been working with the Guyanese government around a project to bring in gas power into the country, lower emissions and more reliable. We've got work going on to help bring up some of the other social services in the country. So, I think people are seeing the progress. And the fact that we're bringing this on sooner and at lower cost, I think, is a benefit to the government. They recognize the values coming faster than originally anticipated. So, it's a -- I think it's a good story of government, I think, and ExxonMobil, got very good relationships, working very constructively. And as I said, it's a win-win-win proposition here and feel good about the progress we're making. Roger Read : And any thoughts on the resource base or the next time you'll offer an update on that? Darren Woods : I think as the team continues to drill and then quantify and characterize the results of those drills, when it gets to a material improvement, we'll be out talking about that. Roger Read : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Darren Woods : Roger, thank you. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our investor website by the end of the week. Have a nice day, everyone. And I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude our call. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning. Welcome to ExxonMobil's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. Here with me are Darren Woods, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the new Investor Relations section of our website. They're meant to accompany the first quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will provide opening comments and reference a few slides from this presentation. That will give analysts more time to ask questions before we conclude at 8 :30 A.M. Central Time. During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. We describe some of them in our cautionary statement here on slide 2. Additional information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements are listed in our most recent Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs available on our website for investors. Also, please note that we provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. And now please turn to slide 3 for Darren's remarks. Darren Woods : Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Following a record year, ExxonMobil delivered the highest first quarter earnings in our history even as energy prices and refining margins moderated from the fourth quarter. This ongoing success reflects the hard work of our people, executing our strategic priorities and fully leveraging our competitive advantages. Through investments in advantaged assets, mix improvements and cost and operating discipline, we are delivering the structural earnings improvements outlined in our corporate plan update last December and expanding the energy supplies needed to meet growing global demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2022, we added about 300,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to global supply, primarily from a 40% increase in production from Guyana in the Permian Basin, increase more than offset our divestments in the expropriation of Sakhalin-1, which we no longer account for, but which importantly remains part of global supply. In addition, our Beaumont refinery expansion reached nameplate capacity in the quarter. This 250,000 barrel a day expansion is the largest US refinery addition in a decade, helping meet society's ongoing need for transportation fuels. Guyana, we're pleased to announce that we reached final investment decisions for Uaru, fifth offshore project, which will bring on even more production from this low-cost, low-carbon intensity resource. Uaru will provide an additional 250,000 barrels a day of gross capacity with start-up targeted for 2026. Earnings in our Product Solutions business benefited from the team's solid operational execution with top quartile turnaround cost and schedule performance during a particularly heavy planned maintenance period. Low Carbon Solutions, we're building momentum across several fronts. In early April, we announced a long-term agreement with Linde to capture, transport and permanently store up to 2.2 million metric tons CO2 annually. Hydrogen, we announced front-end engineering and design contract for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen facility in Baytown, ahead of agreement with SK Group of Korea for offtake of blue ammonia from that facility. As we said during our Low Carbon Solutions spotlight earlier this month, our low carbon projects must be advantaged and deliver competitive returns. The ability of our low-carbon projects to compete successfully for capital is important if the world is going to meet its emissions aspirations. Incentives included in the Inflation Reduction Act are a positive step forward, although permitting and other regulatory improvements are still needed. Europe, by contrast, policy approach remains far more prescriptive and punitive. This is true whether we're talking about the emissions reductions needed to put the world on a path to net-zero or the production needed to provide Europe with affordable and reliable energy. The progress we're making across the company is underpinned by the continuing evolution of our business model. Effective on May 1, two new enterprise-wide organizations will be up and running. Global Business Solutions will centralize the majority of our finance procurement operations, enabling us to deliver simplified corporate-wide processes. ExxonMobil Supply Chain will consolidate supply chain activities globally. The organizations will focus on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies, improve operating and financial results and, importantly, deliver an improved experience for customers, vendors and our people. On June 1, we plan to launch our new enterprise-wide trading organization. Global Trading will bring together expertise from across the company in crude, products, natural gas, power and marine freight trading, plan to build on our record 2022 results, leveraging the unique insights we gain from participating across each of our value chains and all along their entire length, with a global operating footprint larger than any of our competitors. Now, let me cover the quarter's headlines. We're pleased to have delivered $11.4 billion of earnings, a record first quarter following a record year. A significant contributing factor was structural cost savings that now total approximately $7.2 billion, keeps us on track to meet our target of $9 billion by the end of this year. Cash flow from operations totaled $16.3 billion, and our net debt-to-capital ratio declined to 4%, further increasing the strength of our balance sheet, while supporting shareholder distributions of $8.1 billion in the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends. Biodynamic market, our underlying performance remains rock solid and well ahead of our competition, reflecting the many improvements we've made over the last six years and, of course, the hard work of our people. Our diverse portfolio of advantaged businesses, improvements in mix, structural cost savings, excellence in execution are driving industry-leading earnings, cash flow and shareholder value. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet, we have the capability to win across a wide variety of market conditions to deliver strong returns, while meeting the evolving needs of society, including the need to reduce emissions. Leveraging the capabilities and advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we're building an advantaged new business, Low Carbon Solutions, which is positioning us as a leader in the energy transition, in our own and other's emissions and establishing long-term value-accretive growth opportunities that will underpin continued growth in shareholder returns. With that, let me turn the call over to Jennifer. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to Q&A. As a courtesy to other analysts, please limit yourself to a single question. That way we can accommodate more questions from more people. Also, please remain on the line in case we need to ask any clarifying questions. With that, operator, please open up the line for our first question. Operator : Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. Thank you question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Thank you so much. Darren, you spent a lot of time in the refining business over the years, and you've had a perspective on these calls. And margins were going to start to normalize, and we're seeing some indication of that. I'd just be curious on your views on what you're seeing in terms of product demand? And then how do you think it's going to manifest itself in -- through the refining system from a margin perspective over the next couple of years? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes. Good morning Neil. A couple of points, I think as we're looking at the refining margin. Obviously, the first I would make is we don't really pride ourselves on being able to forecast margins. So, our caveat, everything I say with the recognition that given the impact that demand has on the margins, given the fairly static supply side of the equation, it's often difficult to know exactly where things are going to go. What I would say is as you look at where we're at today, I mean, this is seasonally a low point as you head into second quarter and third quarter and driving season when you tend to see supply and demand tighten up and margins improve, you typically see early in the year a lot of refining turnarounds, which take a lot of capacity off-line in that lower demand season. And then when those turnarounds are finished and capacity comes back out, you get a surge of supply. And so you generally see refining margins drop off here in kind of this valley between the supply coming back and then demand picking up as you head into early summer and on to the year. So, I think we're in -- that's important context in terms of what we're seeing right now. Gasoline demand looks pretty reasonable, frankly. I think jet demand and transportation looks like it's kind of trending up and certainly from listening to some of our customers in that space, expectations of a fairly healthy air transportation or airline travel miles going forward in the summer. So, I think in my view is we're going to see the typical push up in the summer and see margins rise longer term. So, it comes back to what happens in China. It has been a source of not only demand but also of exports. There, exports have been higher in the first quarter, but it depends to see how those play out going forward. If we see similar levels of exports as we saw last year, my expectation is that will put additional upward pressure on the margin. So, I think that's kind of the things to watch. The last point I'd make on refining margins, which I think is somewhat structural, typically, the marginal barrel in refining comes out of Europe. And so then Europe set -- is the price setter for global markets ex-transportation. We've got high gas prices in Europe with, I think, the potential to go higher. You've got high carbon prices in Europe. And so that marginal tier of production is a lot more expensive than it's been historically. And that's going to keep, I think, pressure on higher prices for the globe and therefore better margins if you're producing outside of Europe. Neil Mehta : Okay, Darren. Thanks so much. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Darren Woods : Hi, Doug. Doug Leggate : Darren, I wonder if I could kick off first on disposals, another reasonable contribution from non-core asset sales. Can you characterize where you are in that process and what you think you might have still in front of you in terms of non-core asset sales. And I've got a quick follow-up, please. Darren Woods : Sure, Doug. Good morning. Well, I think if you look at the plans we set ourselves, I think, back in 2018 where we talked about, particularly in the Upstream, increasing our divestments and taking a very thoughtful approach there, making sure that we were positioning ourselves that when the market was right and we had interest from buyers, that we had assets ready to sell and divest has worked fairly well. We've been, I think, pretty successful at consistently putting assets in the market and realizing the value of those. We should hit the objective that we set back in 2018 probably sometime this year. And then we've got -- as we continue to work on high grading the portfolio, continue to look at assets that we don't see are strategic necessarily or where we see a potential value -- higher value for others, we'll continue to feed that divestment portfolio and market those assets. So my expectation is we've got an inventory of things going forward and would expect to see, in my mind, kind of consistent rate of being out in the market and basically finding -- seeing if we can find buyers who have a higher use for the assets than we do and therefore better value and therefore decent base. I'd just make the final point that as we look at the divestments, it is a value proposition. We are comfortable with everything we've got in the portfolio. It's really a question of how do we optimize and maximize the value and that's been the focus from the very beginning and continue to be one. So we're not -- we don't have to sell anything. It's only if we find a valuable opportunity to do that. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the answer. I think I couldn't remember if Jennifer said one question or one plus one follow-up. So I'll risk a follow-up very quickly. I'll delicately ask this question, if I may. Obviously, Kathy was on the wires this morning talking about how picky Exxon would be on M&A. I just want to ask you if you feel that you need to backfill your Permian position at any time in the future. And I'll leave you there. Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes. Okay. Doug, I'll give you this one plus one. Look, it amazes me that the amount of questions that come up in this space, I think we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about it. We're always looking for an opportunity for an acquisition and one that grows value. And it's got to be value accretive. It's got to be one where -- what Exxon Mobil brings to the table actually increases what either company would do independent of one another. And so that's kind of, I'd say, the underlying approach. While we're in a depletion business, and we've got to work real hard to continue to bring volume on it, we're not actually in the market to find volume. We're in the market to find value. And we're willing to kind of let volumes do what they will do in the search for making sure that anything that we bring into the portfolio is accretive and is a unique value contribution for the shareholders. And so I mean, we're working really hard on our technology portfolio in the Permian. I've talked about that in the past. My view is success in technology and developing proprietary technology, which improves either resource recovery or the cost of developing that resource, whatever that is, whatever value lever our technology can bring to the table, that obviously opens up deal space. And to the extent that we are very active in the Permian, we've got a really good anchor business there, and we're working real hard on opening up the value proposition of our current acreage with technology, that will open up potentially opportunities for acquisitions. But that's down the road. That's work that we've got to demonstrate to ourselves. There is a unique value proposition there. And then my view would be we'll leverage that to the full extent that we can. But I'd make the same -- that's true for any of the areas of our portfolio where we've got a substantial business today and ongoing technology work to make advances. That's, I think, really what's going to underpin where we focus our attention. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Jennifer Driscoll : And as a reminder, we would like you to limit yourself to single question. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Darren Woods : Good morning. Devin McDermott : So I want to stick with the Permian, but I'm not going to ask an M&A question, I wanted to ask about the results you're seeing there. And if you look at the production in the quarter, you guys reported 615,000 barrels a day. It's a strong sequential growth versus 4Q and also puts you already in line with that 10% growth target that you had laid out for 2023. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the productivity trends and the driver of the strong results that you're seeing there, and then also how you're thinking about the evolution of production for the balance of this year? Darren Woods : Yeah, good morning. I would say we haven't changed our year-end targets, and so the guidance that we gave as part of the corporate plan discussion last year continues to hold. I think we've said in the past that as you look at production in the Permian, it's going to be a little bit lumpy. And so I wouldn't take any one data point, any one quarter's numbers and extrapolate from there. I think you're going to see moving that up and down. I would say, generally speaking, we like what we're seeing in terms of productivity in the Permian. You all know we -- several years ago, our strategy on maximizing oil recovery versus initial production rates that led to a very different development approach trying to work across this cube design, work across all the benches simultaneously to maximize ultimate recovery. That, I think we've been developing that approach, fine tuning it, testing it and evolving that concept. We like where we've gotten to with that approach. I think we're seeing the results of that starting to manifest itself. Our expectation is that we'll continue to, I think, differentiate our production and what we're able to do versus many of the others -- many of our other competitors who started off on this best bench, high initial production rates. With time, I expect to see them pivot maybe a similar approach, but I think we've got a real good head start on that. Like what we're doing there. I think we see some encouraging signs on the early stages of that. And we're going to keep pressing on that, maintain rigs and the capital levels that we've been talking about pretty consistently, and then we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. But we're sticking at this point to same year-end guidance that we gave late last year. Devin McDermott : Great. Thanks, Darren. Darren Woods : Welcome. Operator : We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Darren Woods : Good morning. John Royall : So on the Beaumont expansion, can you talk about how the capacity is being absorbed in the market? And given what's happened to cracks and the general concerns around demand today and granted, I think, Darren's commentary on the market was probably a bit more positive, but are there any concerns about adding capacity at a time where fundamentals appear to be weakening? Darren Woods : Yes. I would say the short answer is, no. Look, we all know these markets are volatile, that they move up and down. We focused, I'll remind you, on the Beaumont expansion. This is something that we began planning and developing many, many years ago. And it was really built on the Permian production and the changes and transportation differentials by bringing crude into the front end of the Beaumont refinery and making the intermediate products to fill our conversion capacity and backing out imports of intermediates and saving the transportation of those intermediates that are typically coming from afar. And so, we justified that project on a transportation differential and felt that, that provided a reasonable return, and with the expectation that on top of that, we would see the value of additional fuels and the higher-value products that we are producing, exactly what we're seeing today. It is very well positioned on the cost of supply curve. And frankly, that's how you need to think about this business. So irrespective of where the margins go, our view is all of our facilities need to be on the far left of the curve, so that we've got a difference between the marginal price setter. And I have every expectation that the capacity that we brought on in Beaumont will -- I know is on the far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so feel pretty good about its competitiveness. John Royall : Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Darren Woods : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : So, I think, looking at the numbers, what sort of jumps off the page is the cash balance. And you've been pretty transparent about this topic and you know the imperative to build a fortress balance sheet. But I wonder if the direction we're going with cash, even net of shareholder returns that are continuing to increase and that are well within sort of your targets, if we're kind of getting beyond fortress and into something even bigger than that. And if there's any thought around kind of the absolute level of cash today and really what's optimal. And I think, I'll just -- I'll catch that with historically, Exxon had kept a very lean balance sheet on both sides relative to sort of the production base and the cash flow base. And so, it's a little bit different than the history of the company, and so I would appreciate your thoughts on it. Thank you. Kathy Mikells : Sure. I'll go ahead and take that, Sam. I mean, our capital allocation approach, I think, has been very consistent and very clear. And we had talked about the fact that we would expect our cash balance post the end of the year to kind of ebb and flow depending on how market prices and margins evolve. So I'd say we're very comfortable with where we stand. It's important for us to have a really strong balance sheet in order to ensure that we stick to our capital allocation priorities through the cycle, right? That's investing in the business and competitively advantaged high-return projects. It's maintaining a very strong balance sheet. You know that balance sheet gives us all the firepower and confidence we need to succeed across a very wide variety of market conditions, which is obviously what this industry faces. And then clearly, we're looking to share our success with shareholders, and you see that through a more consistent share repurchase program and a growing dividend. So, we feel pretty good about our cash balance. I would just also mention that we're in a relatively unusual market environment compared to what we've seen in the past. ExxonMobil's average debt rate is about 3%. You can look up what people are earning on short-term cash. I think three-month treasuries are at 5% today. So, right now, we're not incurring a negative cost of carry on that cash balance, and that's certainly one of the things that we look at as well. So, we feel really good about where we're at today in our balance sheet. Darren Woods : Yes. And I would add, Sam, I think you mentioned history. And in recent history, it's certainly true that we ran fairly lean on cash. But if you go further back to some of the really high cycles, we carried more cash and it reflected the commodity cycle and the nature that typically we're bringing a lot of cash on the top of the commodity cycle. But that's an important asset as you move into the bottom of the cycle, particularly when you're trying to maintain the consistent investment levels and continue to advance the projects in the portfolio. So, I think -- and time from the markets are on the high end of the cycle, I would expect to see cash balances higher so that we're well positioned as we go into the low end of the cycle, which we know will come. Question is obviously when that will come. Sam Margolin : Thank you so much. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Thank you. Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning Roger. Roger Read : What I'd like to ask on the specific commentary about the $7.2 billion in savings on track for the $9 billion this year. Could you characterize a little bit where that's come from to-date, how kind of general inflation within not just the oil field but in general, how that's affecting that? And is $9 billion, like is that the end of the program, or is there something to happen beyond that? I know I'm kind of asking three questions in one, but they're all focused right around the $7 billion to $9 billion. So, if you allow me, I'll throw that out. Kathy Mikells : I'll try and circle around that kind of suite of questions for you, Roger. So, I'd start by saying, overall, we feel really good about the progress that we've made. We're very much on track for the $9 billion at the end of this year relative to 2019. If you look overall at where a number of, I'd say, different programs are driving savings for us, one is just improving the overall productivity across our workforce. If you think about how that's manifested itself in Upstream, it's been a significant reduction in what I would describe as above-field cost that's been a real focus of that organization. We've made a number of different organizational changes over the past couple of years, I would describe those generally as looking to centralize kind of key functions across the company that have been done disparately. Previously, our global projects organization would be a great example of that. Last year, more recently, the combination of our Upstream -- I'm sorry, our Downstream and Chem organization into our Product Solutions business, a lot of simplification coming across that business as a result, combining our engineering and research kind of groups collectively together and then just recently announcing the combination of our supply chain across the organization and setting up a global business services organization and combining our global trading capabilities across the company. And so that's all about improving the experience for our employees, for our vendors, for our customers and continuing to drive efficiencies and importantly, effectiveness across those organizations. We would have seen actually the benefit of some of that in this recent quarter. We talked a little bit in our presentation about the fact that our maintenance activities, we had a pretty heavy turnaround quarter, and those maintenance activities really came in at the first quartile. So much better than what we had planned for, shorter duration. That enabled us obviously to have better throughput than we would have been planning overall for the quarter. And so that's a big area of savings for us. And that's another organization that we have recently centralized in our global operations and sustainability group. So that gives you, I'd say, a little bit of a characterization of where savings are coming from. And certainly, some of the more recent changes that we've made in the organization, we'd expect to drive efficiencies and effectiveness going forward from here. And then just the last comment, like does the program end. So just to be clear, we've talked about a specific time period externally because we thought that would be helpful in transparency. Internally, we don't actually manage this as, hey, there's onetime period that we're focused on as opposed to we are focused on continuing to drive structural cost savings over time. Those are embedded in the plans that we shared with you last December. And obviously, we'll be doing an update when we come to the end of the year. And so we'll talk in more detail about what we see from there on a go-forward basis. Darren Woods : And the final point I'd make to build on what Kathy said is we have seen with all these organizational changes, as our people have come together the new organizations and focused on the objectives of those organizations and what the corporation is trying to achieve, we find a lot more opportunities than we could envision even going in to the changes. So my expectation is as these new organizations come together, they'll begin to find things. The organizational changes we've already made are continuing to find things. So our expectation as we head into the future is we'll continue to drive efficiencies and deliver structural cost savings on to the bottom line. Kathy Mikells : And then I'll just circle back. You asked a little bit about inflation. We actually have put an additional disclosure in our press release, so I'd encourage you to look at that. If you look at the quarter, we more than offset inflationary cost pressure with the structural savings that we were able to generate. Overall, I'd say, the organization is doing a good job at looking to offset inflation in what's obviously been a higher inflation environment recently. Roger Read : Thank you. Kathy Mikells : Welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on the Downstream business and given your global reach there, we're seeing reports that Asian refiners are contemplating run cuts while margins in the US are still really robust. And I'm wondering if you see that dynamic has kind of balanced where cracks in Asia are zero but margins in the US are still 20, and that's kind of representative of the market structure that we're in, or do you expect the weakness in Asia margins to force US refining margins lower in the near-term? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yeah, sure, I'll take that. I think the first comment I would make is over some period of time, and it's typically pretty short, the world balances. And we always use the phrase of the world as round. So it's hard to stay disconnected with -- the margins eventually have to equilibrate on transportation differentials. And so that's the model that I have in my mind. There are always short-term disruptions. You certainly saw that coming out of the pandemic with some of the logistics constraints. So there will obviously be periods of time where things constrain that. But generally speaking, that happens. I think the margins in the US will be a function of what production source is setting the marginal layer of production. As I said earlier, that has historically come out of Europe. And there, cost structures have increased, and so that marginal barrel is now higher, which is underpinning higher Gulf Coast refining. I don't frankly see that changing in the short-term. Obviously, if additional capacity comes on, it's much lower cost. And that supply overwhelms any growth in demand, and we'll see the marginal price that are changed. And then with time, that will get balanced out based on transportation differentials. My sense of things is if you look back to last year and the export levels coming out of China and the balances in Asia that stayed reasonably tight. The question will be, do we see the same thing this year. And I think time will tell. Jason Gabelman : All right. Thanks. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Hi, thanks. This maybe a bit of a follow-up on the questions previously about cost structure and the balance sheet. But I was wondering, Darren, if you could just address how and remind us how you're thinking about dividend growth, right? Because we've got clear evidence here that you've got foundational earnings growth. You've got projects that are coming on sooner and bigger if you look at Guyana, the Permian is doing well. You're adding base capacity downstream. So just wondering if you could remind us on a mid-cycle basis how to think about -- and how the Board thinks about dividend growth, because certainly, you've derisked some of those foundational earnings? Darren Woods : Yeah, I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Kathy to build on, but I would just say, generally, as we think about the dividend, we try to keep the long-term in mind and also be extremely conscious of the commodity cycles and the variability and the volatility that we see in the marketplace and making sure that we establish a level of dividends that are reliable, sustainable, and I'd like to see those grow with time. That's been our history. That's what you've seen us do. And you see us fight certainly during the pandemic year fight really hard to make sure that we sustain that. And that's, I think, a commitment that I feel really strong about. And so it's really about making sure that what we do there is sustainable for the long-term. And then obviously, we can balance disbursement -- shareholder disbursements with buybacks. But I think maintaining a long-term perspective and making sure our shareholders feel rewarded through the dividend policy is an underlying principle. Kathy, do you want to add anything to that? Kathy Mikells : Yeah, I'd say we look to take a very balanced approach as we think about shareholder distributions and getting that balance between a growing competitive dividend, right, as well as the efficiency through share repurchases. And I think we're striking a pretty even balance in that regard. And we definitely think about this over the long term as opposed to the near term, given we're in a business that's highly cyclical. And so, you've seen us in the last two years raise the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year. We're never going to get out in front of the Board of Directors. It's obviously something that we look at regularly, and we know it's important to ensure that dividend competitive and growing. And about 40% of our shareholders are retail shareholders, so more of the moms and pops across the globe that are investors. And so we know it's important. It's something we're really focused on. Stephen Richardson : Thank you, very much. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Maybe a question on the chemicals business. You saw sequential margin improvement in your chemicals products business driven by advantaged ethane pricing. Have we turned the corner in the chemicals environment? And can you talk about how you see the trajectory of margins in that business over the course of 2023? Darren Woods : Sure. I'll start then and then, Kathy, if you got anything to add to it. I think, these -- like all the businesses that we're in, the underlying drivers of the chemical margins tend to be the commodity chemicals that are driven by supply/demand and the balances or imbalances in supply/demand. The margin, we saw a lot of capacity come on. You remember, as we went through the pandemic, a lot of investments got stalled and pulled back. And then as we came out, those got turned back on again and have come on to the marketplace. We've seen a lot of capacity coming on. I expect we'll still see some of that come on here in the short term. And then in conjunction with that, the COVID impacts took a while for it to unwind through, what I'd say, is the global economy, which impacted chemical demand. As you know, it's very tied to economic activity. So if economic activity is constrained, then chemical demand is constrained. And we certainly saw that with the China lockdowns. Where we're at now is, that capacity is out there and on and it's just a question of where demand goes. And frankly, I think it's early with China. We do see some promising signs, but we'll have to see how that -- China demand and their economic activity picks up. The other point I would make is, feed and feed optimization is a big part of the margin equation as well. We've got some fairly diverse assets with respect to the ability to manage feed and change feedstocks around. As gas prices came off, that gave us a better liquid to gas spread that allowed us to change some of our feed into our crackers and get the advantage of that. So that was a help in the first quarter, some of that feed optimization. And that will play into it as well. And I think that's what you saw in the first quarter. And then the more macro impacts, we'll see how they play out as we go forward. Kathy, anything? Kathy Mikells : Yes. The only other thing I'd add is, we obviously brought on our Baton Rouge chemical expansion project late in the fourth quarter. That's spooled up in quarter. That's part of an overall strategy of growing Performance Chemicals along with growing high-value products across our Product Solutions business, be it performance chemicals or full emission fuels, high-value lubes. And so, even though the market has been tough, that project actually had a positive earnings and cash flow contribution for us in the quarter. So that's a big part of our overall strategy and mixing up in both the Chemical business and across our Product Solutions business. And we feel very good about the results that's bringing. And we obviously have a very heavy US Gulf Coast footprint kind of relative to the global footprint, and that helped us in the sequential improvement in margins. Darren Woods : Yes. It's a great example of where we're focused on, advantaged projects that bring on advantaged low-cost capacity. So, that polypropylene unit that we brought on in really what is a pretty low point in the polypropylene market to make earnings, positive earnings on a brand-new piece of kit that starts up in the lowest of the cycle is, I think, a testament to the strength of the projects that we are investing in and bringing online. Ryan Todd : Thanks Darren and Kathy. Darren Woods : Thank you. Kathy Mikells : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi. Alastair Syme : Hello. Darren and Kathy, thanks very much. I wonder if I could just ask about unit depreciation trends. There's quite a big change first quarter versus fourth quarter in depreciation. Is that some of the portfolio effect in the year that we should be picking up? How does that rate through the year then? Kathy Mikells : Sure. I'm happy to answer that. What you tend to see in depreciation is some ebbs and flows associated with our asset management activities. And so when we're selling assets, sometimes we're taking a small impairment that runs through depreciation. And so I'd say you kind of have to take a step back from that noise in depreciation. If I put that to the side, the company has run about, I'll call it, $19 billion, $20 billion annually in depreciation and amortization. So, that's how I think about it. Alastair Syme : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on trading because there's been various press reports about Exxon wanting to build up its capabilities in asset optimization and trading. And I was just wondering where you are in that journey. Because, obviously, we've seen some exceptional volatility in 2022 and early this year across oil and gas. And if I look at some of the numbers from some of your peers, it looks like that those businesses, the asset and optimization could add up to 5% on ROCE in exceptional environment. So, you obviously have a big advantage with your refining footprint and your asset base. I'm just wondering how sort of vigorously are you pursuing this opportunity? And how long do you expect it to take to get to where you want to be on the trading front? Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. And good morning Biraj, thanks for the question. I think putting aside the press reports of the media, we've talked about this, I think, starting back in 2018. And what triggered our emphasis on China trade and the emphasis that we're putting on trade is the reorganization that we made coming out of the functional organizational construct into value chains. And as you move in the value chains, the opportunity to trade along that value chain and generate insights and advantage along with value chain changes pretty dramatically. And so that move to a value chain construct that we had early on between Refining and Downstream that -- we now have that with our Product Solutions organization. We've now integrated our Upstream into those value chains. And so we've got a really streamlined and good view of the marketplace. And so we can now trade all along the entire length of the value chain, we can trade across those value chains. And then obviously, we can take advantage of the global footprint as you referenced and trade along that global footprint and arbitrage between the markets. And so I think our organizational construct today gives us a much better line of sight and opportunity to optimize in the trading space. So we started growing that in 2018. That has been what I would say is on a continuum of growth. We like what we see there. We like -- we brought talent in there. We've had -- we've traded for a long time. We just gave the trading organizations within the company some different objective statements, and they've done really well responding to that, bringing value to the bottom line. And what we just announced is taking the trading organizations that today are somewhat dispersed through the organization and consolidating those into one centralized trading organization for the whole of the corporation. We think that makes a lot of sense. We did a lot of work over the last couple of years to validate what we thought the opportunity size was there and what would be needed to get after that. And we're now, I'd say, in execution mode with respect to putting the organization together, putting in the support systems, bringing in the talent, developing the talent and growing the talent in that space. And so I would just think of it as a progression, a continuation with what we believe is a huge opportunity. And we're going to do that in a very thoughtful, controlled pace but one that is very focused on significantly growing the value proposition there, really around our footprint. This is not about going out and taking speculative positions. This is about going out and optimizing, given the asset base that we have, the value chains that we're participating in. taking the insights generated from running those businesses and the opportunities that come with those insights and transacting on them. That's what the organization is going to be doing. And like I said, even in the short time, we've seen some really good results. I think we've got a clear line of sight to some additional ones. And that -- the value of that opportunity will manifest itself in our business that the -- this is really around trading on the value created through the transformation of molecules and developing products that people want and then moving those products around the world. And so that platform gives our traders a great base to optimize off of. That's where we'll see the value accrue. Biraj Borkhataria : That's very helpful. Just if possible, a quick follow-up. But does that change at all the way you look to manage your cash balances going forward? I'm thinking about relative to prior cycles. If you have a higher kind of exposure to trading, maybe you would like to run with a high cash generally Am I wrong in that, or is there any -- any color would be helpful. Kathy Mikells : So we obviously take the company's working capital needs into consideration as we think about our balance sheet and our cash balance, all else held equal, a bigger company means a bigger working capital needs. So that's how I would think about it. I'd also say, as it relates to trading generally, I mean, there's some near-term, I would say, working capital that has to be brought in mind in terms of the trading organization. The profits that come through trading are different quarter-to-quarter, but I'd say year-to-year, pretty steady. Biraj Borkhataria : Got it. Thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Darren, can you give us an\u2026 Darren Woods : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Can you give us an update where you are on in Mozambique and also in the Papua New Guinea LNG, in terms of the Papua New Guinea expansion talk? Darren Woods : Yeah. I think just I'd speak to maybe the LNG portfolio as a whole. We're making good progress there. I'd say specifically -- and working through project concepts and designs and making sure that we're developing projects that are going to be on that left-hand side of cost of supply curve. We're bringing on production is very competitive in the marketplace to make sure that for the long-term, we have a robust supply point there. I think good progress in both PNG and Mozambique with respect to that, we've had good progress with the government in PNG in terms of getting the agreements that we need, signed and helping us move forward. We're working with our partner there, Total. So feel good about the progress that we got there \u2013 we\u2019re making there. And then with Mozambique, obviously, been on whole for a while, given some of the challenges there, and we\u2019ll continue to keep close eye on that, and as the situation improves and we feel comfortable that we can successfully go in there and develop the project, we\u2019ll take steps to go do that, and conjunction with Total and the work that they're doing there. Paul Cheng : Darren, can I ask -- in Mozambique, Total seems to be optimistic about the security on the ground there, just working through on the cost structure with the contractor. And do you guys still have concern on security, or that you are going through the similar process to turn on the cost structure side? Darren Woods : Yeah. We work very closely with Total, obviously, given the same exposures and the work that we're doing together. So I'd tell you it's kind of a hand-in-hand approach that we're taking there, sharing information. We've had our own security folks out there assessing the situation. I would say our assessment is very consistent with Total's assessment. We don't see a lot of difference between what the conclusions they're coming up with and our conclusion. So we do like the progress that we've seen there. Obviously, we need to be convinced that that will sustain that progress. And today, I feel pretty optimistic about that. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Darren Woods : Welcome. Jennifer Driscoll : Okay. I think that, that completes our Q. So thank you, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our new investor website in a few days. Additionally, we look forward to connecting again on May 31st for our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Have a nice weekend, everyone. And now let me turn it back to the operator to conclude our call. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Exxon Mobil's second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. Our slides, script and earnings release are available in the Investors section of our website. In a moment, Darren will provide opening comments. Then we'll take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcement to acquire Denbury and related materials in this presentation, we've included additional information on Slide 2. During the presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments. These are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You may find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Please note, that we have supplemental information at the end of our slides. Now, let me turn it over to Darren. Darren Woods : Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. I'm pleased to be conducting our earnings call from our Houston campus. As of July 1st, our corporate headquarters is now located at the campus, alongside the senior managers of our businesses and centralized organizations. This is the first time in the company\u2019s history that the senior leadership team of the corporation is located on one site and represents a critical step in continuing the transformation of our business enabling us to improve collaboration and alignment and further leverage synergies across our integrated businesses. The ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained, industry-leading performance was clearly demonstrated in our second-quarter results. We delivered earnings of almost $8 billion, two times higher than what we earned in the second quarter of 2018, under comparable industry commodity prices. That doubling of earnings reflects our work in the intervening years to reshape our portfolio of businesses, invest in advantaged projects, and drive a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do. With these results, I would like to take a moment to recognize our people. Starting with all those that made the move to Houston. I\u2019m sure you know moves like this are not easy and that many personal sacrifices are made. I\u2019m very thankful for all who did this. Their willingness to disrupt their lives for the benefit of our company is a testament to the dedication of our people whose commitment and hard work underpin all the improvements we are making. I hope our shareholders take comfort in this one, small example of our people\u2019s commitment to the company and have confidence in their resolve to further strengthen our position as an industry leader in all that we do. Our achievements this quarter also demonstrate the progress we\u2019re making in solving the \u201cand\u201d equation: meeting the world\u2019s needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions, both our own and others\u2019. In the Permian, we set another production record and remain on track for an overall growth in production of 10% this year. As I said last quarter, our growth won\u2019t be linear as we execute our development plans that balance and optimize capital efficiency, resource recovery, and production rates. Our priority will remain on driving value, not volumes. In Guyana, we achieved a record quarterly gross production rate of 380,000 barrels per day. Our team in Guyana continues to deliver excellent operating, environmental and safety results, while optimizing and growing production. In fact, we see the potential to increase the combined gross capacity of these two FPSOs to above 400,000 barrels a day with further debottlenecking, which is nearly a 20% increase above the investment basis and a testament to the ingenuity of our people. In the Gulf Coast, we continue to profitably grow our business. In the second quarter we achieved mechanical completion of the Baytown chemical expansion. The project grows volume and improves mix with 750,000 tonnes per annum of additional performance chemical products. The Baytown expansion is the final Product Solutions component of the Growing the Gulf initiative announced in 2017. If you recall, the initiative committed to investments of $20 billion over ten years to capitalize on the US\u2019s advantaged resources, economic growth, and strong regional support for our businesses and the jobs we create. 11 of the 13 projects are up and running. The Baytown expansion, after product qualifications, should begin contributing by the fourth quarter. And Golden Pass, the last of our Growing the Gulf projects, should have its first train up at the back end of 2024. The Growing the Gulf initiative is another example of executing our strategy, investing in advantaged, high-value growth, and delivering on our commitments. Improving the earnings power of our businesses also requires divestments. In the second quarter we completed the divestment of the Billings refinery. Including this sale, cash proceeds from divestments of non-strategic assets have totaled roughly $2 billion year-to-date. In advancing our efforts to better leverage corporate scale and integration, we established three new centralized organizations in the quarter. Consolidating activities previously embedded in each of our businesses : Global Business Solutions, ExxonMobil Supply Chain, and Global Trading. They\u2019re all off to a good start and have clear lines of sight to improve performance and lower cost. Our Low Carbon Solutions business continues to make progress in building an advantaged, low cost, high-return business in capturing, transporting, and storing carbon. We announced a CO2 offtake agreement with Nucor, one of North America\u2019s largest steel producers. And we signed an agreement to acquire Denbury, which will provide ExxonMobil with the largest owned and operated network of CO2 pipelines in the United States. Combining Denbury\u2019s assets and experience with our capabilities will significantly accelerate and expand our ability to profitably help customers reduce their emissions and allow ExxonMobil to play an even greater role in a thoughtful energy transition. It significantly enhances our competitive position and offers a compelling customer proposition to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize heavy industries which, today, have limited practical options. Of Denbury\u2019s 1,300 miles of CO2 pipeline, roughly 70% are in the Gulf Coast states of Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, one of the largest US markets for CO2 reduction and home to some of ExxonMobil\u2019s largest integrated refining and chemical sites and nine of their 10 strategically-located CO2 storage sites are also in this region. We believe the transaction synergies will drive strong growth and returns. A cost-efficient transportation and storage system accelerates CCS deployment for both ExxonMobil and our third-party customers. It supports multiple low-carbon value chains, including CCS, hydrogen, ammonia, and biofuels. Ultimately, we see an opportunity to create a CCS business with the capacity to reduce emissions across the Gulf Coast by up to 100 million tons per year. This transaction will help us do that at a lower cost and faster pace. In fact, we see the potential for a third of the opportunity being actionable in the near term. Which takes us to our customers. Our latest offtake agreement extends our CCS customer base beyond industrial gas and fertilizers into steel. This project will tie into the same CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure we\u2019ll use to serve CF Industries, located just 10 miles from Nucor. Focusing our efforts and investments in areas with concentrated sources of emissions allows us to capture the benefits of scale, reduce our spend per ton of CO2 captured and improves returns. Our work with Nucor supports Louisiana\u2019s goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and it increases the total amount of CO2 we\u2019ve agreed to transport and store for customers to 5 million metric tons per year, equivalent to replacing 2 million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles on the road in the United States today. With the planned Denbury acquisition, the potential reduction could be up to 20 times that. As demonstrated by these new developments, we\u2019re continuing to make significant progress in our plans to lead industry in helping society reduce emissions. A major component of our improved earnings is the structural cost savings that we\u2019ve achieved, currently at $8.3 billion. We remain on track to reach our target of $9 billion in savings by the end of this year. As we develop plans for future years, we\u2019re committed to finding additional savings. Cash flow from operations totaled $9.4 billion in the quarter, or $13 billion excluding the change in working capital. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with the full-year guidance we shared last year as part of our Capex investments totaled $12.5 billion year-to-date, also in line with our full-year guidance. And, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy, we continue to share our success with shareholders, distributing $8 billion in cash during the quarter, including $4.3 billion in share repurchases and $3.7 billion in dividends. Before we go to Q&A, I\u2019ll leave you with a few key takeaways from the quarter. First, our work to structurally improve earnings power is paying off, demonstrated this quarter as we doubled earnings versus a comparable price environment in the second quarter of 2018. Our reorganizations, aggressive investments in advantaged projects, and significant reductions in cost are driving value and improving our competitive position. We\u2019ve made great progress and have a clear line of sight to much more. In the back half of this year alone, we expect to bring on two advantaged projects : Baytown Performance Chemicals and the Payara FPSO in Guyana, further growing our capacity to generate industry-leading earnings. The company\u2019s ongoing business transformation is giving the organization a better view of end-to-end value creation and focusing us on the highest value opportunities. Today, we are better positioned than ever to realize the value of our scale and the synergies from improving the integration of our businesses. For the first time in our history, we have a corporate technology, projects, trading, supply chain, and business solutions organization allowing us to apply the best solutions and talent to our biggest opportunities. And, importantly, we are developing the most talented people in the industry, providing unrivaled opportunities to meet some of society\u2019s greatest challenges. Their work is delivering exceptional results, driving industry-leading returns on investments, and growth in earnings and cash flow. This, in turn, allows us to distribute cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a sustained, competitive, and growing dividend while maintaining investments in industry advantaged projects including investments in our Low Carbon Solutions business. By leveraging the advantages developed in our traditional businesses, we are laying the foundation for a world-scale, competitively-advantaged, low carbon business with industry-leading returns. The planned acquisition of Denbury is a step in that direction, improving our decarbonization proposition for customers, while generating attractive returns. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with the quarter, the progress it represents and the improved earnings power of the company. We\u2019re confident that we have the right strategy with the right leadership and best people to effectively execute it, delivering sustained growth in shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jennifer. Jennifer Driscoll : We\u2019ll now begin our Q&A session. Please note, that we continue to request that analyst as a single question as a courtesy to the other analyst. However, please remain on the line in case you need any clarifying questions. Now with that, operator, please open the line for our first question. Operator : Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Darren, I wonder if I could pick up on the cost saving target. And I guess my question is, post Denbury, and given that we're already halfway through 2023. Where does that $9 billion cost saving target go through the end of the plan period through 2027? Darren Woods : It goes up, Doug, in short. I think as you know, and we've been talking about the reorganizations that we've been executing over the years with some of them just recently executed, puts us in a position to really capture a lot of efficiencies across the whole of the enterprise this year as we develop our corporate plans. Obviously, one of the objectives of these new organizations is to take stock of what they've got in their portfolio and identify the opportunities to further capture the benefits of scale and the synergies that exist between the integrated business and what for the first time represents an opportunity to actually manage processes across these integrated businesses. So I think we've got an opportunity set to drive that cost reduction even further as we head out further in the planned horizon. And my expectation is, when we come back at the end of the year after we've developed the plans, reviewed them with the board and then share them with all of you, we'll provide some perspective on what that opportunity looks like going forward. Doug Leggate : Would you care to offer an order of magnitude, Darren? Kathy Mikells : Doug, I tell you to go back to the Investor Day materials from March of 2022. We had some bridges in it where we kind of laid out earnings and how much structural cost savings we're driving, earnings improvement relative to volume and mix. And I think if you just look at the size of those bars, you'll get a rough order of magnitude. Doug Leggate : And then going forward, but I'll leave it there. Thanks. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you, Doug. Operator : We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning. Darren, you've been clear that you think that there's value to be had potentially in M&A in both low carbon and the Permian and Denbury really well into the former of those two. I'd be curious on your perspective on whether on the M&A markets right now and how are you thinking about approaching opportunistic value creation to that? Darren Woods : Yes. Good morning, Neil. I would say that our perspective on that whole space. And I know it's one that's of great interest and we've talked about, it seems like for a number of successive quarters, hasn't really changed quite frankly. I think what we are holding ourselves to and evaluating opportunities in that space is the ability to create unique value, unique shareholder value. And so, the opportunities have to be bigger than what ExxonMobil or any potential acquisition could do independent of one another. So I think you've heard us say that one plus one has to equal three here. And that's what we are -- how we're thinking about that space. Obviously, from the very beginning, back in 2018 when we started talking about better leveraging our key competitive advantages, one of the drives to do that is to open up value opportunities that basically others can\u2019t achieve. And as I've made -- try to make clear in this quarter's prepared remarks and in previous quarters, we're making great progress on better leveraging those competitive advantages, bringing them to bear on the business, delivering bottom line results. The more we do that, the more we advance our technology portfolio, the bigger the opportunity to identify unique value opportunities with other companies. And so, we're continuing to look for that, but we're not going to compromise our expectation of generating returns and growing value for the shareholders. So I think Kathy said many times in the past, we're pretty picky acquires. I don't see us change in that position. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Darren. Darren Woods : You bet, Neil. Operator : We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Darren Woods : Good morning. Devin McDermott : So I wanted to ask about the Permian. You've had strong results so far this year and in the slides you had some interesting charts and some of the advantages you see versus peers and how you develop the asset. I was wondering if you could dive into a little bit more detail on that. When you think about some of the specific drivers that allow you to get such better MPV versus other cube development in the basin, what are those in your view? And as part of that, could you address the resource recovery trends you're seeing and the improvement there and any room for further up-side on that? Darren Woods : Yes, sure. Al, I guess maybe start by going back to the approach we outlined 2018-2019 timeframe where we said ExxonMobil can bring a different game to the unconventional space and really bring to bear and leverage the capabilities that we have versus many others who are competing in that space. And key amongst those was taking advantage of our scale and balance sheet to develop this asset at scale. And so, you may recall, we talked about the cube development, which was really focusing on how you maximize overall recovery and not near term production. That wasn't a particularly well received approach back in 2018-2019 timeframe, but I think with time, it's demonstrated its value and it's actually manifesting itself in the results that you see today, which is, we're focused on making sure that as we develop the resources and all the benches in that resources, particularly the ones that are connected, that we do that in an optimum way, that develops and maximizes the recovery versus initial production rates. And so that's really important. That cube development, we continue to evolve that. I think we've gotten to a stage now where we feel really good about how we're executing that development. We focused on capital efficiency. And I would tell you today, we are setting records for the length of our lateral wells, which, again, lowers the cost associated with accessing the resource. And importantly, as you drill longer wells, it's critical that the productivity of each foot of that well remains constant. And so, we've done a lot of work to make sure that the productivity of each foot is consistent as we drill longer and longer. So that's driving capital costs down pretty significantly. And then I would say, we've got a lot of technologies that we're trialing, ones that I won't go into specific detail on to try to match some eyes recovery. And we've got those technologies deployed in the field. We've got some early results that are quite encouraging, but they aren't at the scale today to manifest themselves completely in our results. So, I think all those things together continue to give us a lot of confidence that not only have we moved to the front of the pack and demonstrated industry leadership with what we've got today that we see a lot of upside to that as we move forward and I don't think we've reached the end of the optimization process yet. Devin McDermott : Great. Thanks Darren. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : Moving next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Good morning. Thank you. Darren Woods : Good morning, Sam. Sam Margolin : This question is about EOR. Hopefully, you don't find it too far afield. But because you are [Technical Difficulty] Jennifer Driscoll : Devin, you are kind of breaking up on us. Sam, are you available? Operator, let's try another question and come back to Sam. Operator : Okay. We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm just looking at your bridge for energy products and you have over $2 billion of negative margin, it's right in line with the number out of your 8-K, so no surprises there, but definitely a bigger decline on a relative basis than we're seeing from your couple of peers that have reported so far. So, just looking for any additional color on the drivers of that margin decline? Maybe there's something to call out around regional mix or crude slates that are a bit more unique to Exxon? Kathy Mikells : Yes. I wouldn't say there's anything unique. I mean, this is a straight flow through of just what the industry refining margin reduction is kind of flowing through. We would see a much bigger reduction coming out of where we have a bigger footprint. So I would say even though the US tends to have better margins than the rest of the world, we obviously have a very big footprint in the US. And so, just that footprint drives a bigger absolute number and absolute decline, but it's just a straight flow through from the change in industry margins. Darren Woods : Yes, the size of our refining business is much, much larger than our peers. So the impacts associated with the changes in those margins have a bigger impact on us than you'd see with our peers. John Royall : Sure. I was just looking at it's kind of like a 50% cut to the 1Q number on the margin side. But yes, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes, hello. Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning, Roger. Kathy Mikells : Good morning. Roger Read : I'd like to follow-up on the chemicals margin. You made the comment on the opening about margin -- excuse me, pricing where it was in 2018, but margins much better. That said, chemicals isn't quite back to the 2021 high point. So anything else you can offer on how the chemical outlook is getting any better? And one of the reasons I'll ask that question is, when we look at the softness in NGL prices in the US and this expectation of much higher exports, we hear talk about increase in China chemical capacity. So, how should we kind of juxtapose what looks like an improving market for you, certainly better margins versus potentially a lot of new capacity into that area. Darren Woods : Yes, sure. I'll give you a couple of perspectives on that and then see if Kathy has anything to add. I think, first of all, what I'd say is, the work that we've done over the years to make sure that we've got a well-diversified feed slate for our chemicals business continues to pay off, particularly in these markets as things are shifting around and price spreads are moving. Our organization is pretty adopted responding to those price signals and change in feed. So that continues to make its way to the bottom line and position us better than many of our peers with that flexibility and the feed optionality that we have. I think as you look around the world, early on there was -- with China being in a COVID lockdown and recognizing the role that it has in chemicals demand. That was kind of the back half of last year. And the impact and as we've come into this year, I think a lot of expectations for China to pick up and with that growth in demand in chemicals we are seeing that starting to happen. In fact, if you look at the -- ourselves in chemicals, the second quarter was stronger than the first quarter. So we are seeing that. The demand looks pretty reasonable, I would say. I mean, the big -- that challenge and you've referenced it is the amount of supply that's come on. And that's where I think our feedstock advantages and our footprint in the integration that we have with a number of refineries around the world actually positions us better. But it'll take some time is my expectation for demand to kind of take us out of the supply, the excess supply that we've got on the marketplace, but I would just add that, we've made a lot of investment in chemicals over the last five years, fairly significant investments. And one of the things that frankly I'm quite pleased with is, if you look at all those chemical investments that we brought online, even in the depths of what is a pretty low bottom of cycle condition for our chemical business, all of those brand new projects are earnings positive and cash positive, which I think really bodes well for when the market comes back up and we're at top of cycle. So, I feel good about how we position the business and, frankly, we're doing exactly what we had hoped for, which is, when you get into tough conditions that our business continues to outperform competition. And so it puts us in a good position as markets tighten back up again and margins improve we will be in an even better position. Kathy Mikells : And I would add a couple of quick stats to that. So relative to competition, again, our geographic footprint is pretty advantaged. And so, we're about 35% larger in North America than, I'll call it, rest of industry. And then the other thing I'd point out that gets to what Darren just said about some of the projects we've been implementing, those projects helped to support an improvement in our overall mix. And so, this quarter, we saw a 6% increase in performance chemical products and those carry a higher margin. So those are some of the more systemic things that help to drive improvement relative to competitors. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Follow-up question on the carbon capture side of the business. If we look, we\u2019ve got global coal demand hitting a record in 2023, global oil demand is going to hit a record in 2023, if it hasn't already. Just curious, Darren, is there -- when you were -- you've already laid out your strategy, all that makes sense. The Denbury acquisition certainly fits well in that. Just curious if you're getting any additional sort of outside pressure to maybe accelerate something on this, given that, if you think about it from an energy transition standpoint, two or three years ago, everybody was saying we would have already had peak demand for this, peak demand for that, clearly not happening. If we're going to have a lot more carbon emissions, are you getting any additional pressure to accelerate carbon capture? Darren Woods : Yes, I think what you're seeing today is a reflection of the challenge that the world faces, and frankly, an incomplete solution set. And I think unfortunately the focus, if you go back several years, and I would say the exclusive focus on wind, solar and EVs and the fact that other alternatives and other solutions that frankly at the time we were advocating for and in fact trying to develop internally weren't considered or actually -- weren't actually accepted as slowed society's progress and its emissions reductions in capturing. I think today, there's this recognition that we need more solutions and that frankly the industry can bring those solutions to bear. And at this stage of what is going to be a very complicated and expensive transition, we need as many solutions on the table as possible. Not eliminating any of them and staying focused on emissions reductions. I think that\u2019s starting to resonate. And so, I don't -- the challenge here is, this is a very nascent, the areas that we're focused on, which are the molecule oriented parts of the business that are very consistent with our capabilities and expertise and advantages, that's a -- we're in the very early stages. Frankly, we're in the lead in that space. There aren't any other companies that have secured the kind of third party mission reduction opportunities that we have that would -- there aren't any parties out there that have got the scale of the investments that we're progressing. And so, I think generally, people recognize that we're delivering on our ambition to lead the industry. And more than anything else, we are supportive. Obviously, there's a desire to make things go faster. And frankly, that's a function of the opportunity set. And if you think about the IRA and the role it plays, that legislation hasn't even been translated into regulations yet and that's going to be a critical step. And I think there are many governments around the world who are working on appropriate legislation to incentivize and create a carbon -- market for carbon that hasn't come to be yet. So there, we're very early in this process and there are a number of players in here who have a role deliver. We feel like we're delivering on our part, but there are other elements that have to come together for this to be successful. And then ultimately, we're going to need advances in technology to keep driving that cost down so that we can get to more and more diluted streams of CO2. And we're doing a lot of work in that space. And frankly, again, I think our pipeline of opportunities, our technology pipeline, I feel pretty good about it. And I hope to, in the next several years to hopefully commercialize some technologies to further reduce the cost of emissions reductions. So I think early, a lot of work going on. I think we're making a lot of good progress and we feel good about the role that we're playing in the leadership position that we have. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hello. Is that is that better, sound wise? Darren Woods : That is better. That's better, Sam. Welcome back. Sam Margolin : I'm okay. So this question is about EOR as it pertains to Denbury. I think, there's some optimism that EOR barrels might be credited with carbon attributes because it varies more CO2 than the associated emissions of the oil. And so, maybe that's option value, but I was just wondering where you stand on that topic and if it was at all a factor as you look at different asset classes and saw that EOR was available? Darren Woods : Yes. So I would say, obviously, that's the core business today of Denbury and had facilitated infrastructure that they have in place. That frankly for us was not a key driver, strategic driver of the opportunity. I think EOR certainly in the short term can play a role. But if you think about the broader opportunity, it's really around carbon capture storage, sequestration and keeping the carbon under the ground. So that's the longer term play for us. I mean, as I just commented here about the challenges with the regulation and the translation of the IRA into regulation, we've got Class 6 well Permian, that's going to be required for sequestration. That's a fairly slow progress to date. So, there's a lot of work that has to go into putting these pieces together so that we're successful. I see EOR as providing a lot of optionality in the short term that as we're bringing on carbon capture facilities, working with third parties and we start capturing the CO2. If we don't have everything lined up on the sequestration side, the EOR gives us an opportunity to progress these things and not lose schedules. So, I think right now that's the way I would think about it. It's certainly not a strategic thrust for us as a company. Sam Margolin : Understood. Thank you so much. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Stephen Richardson : Good morning. I was wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the debottlenecking opportunity you talked about in Guyana, clearly 20% above nameplate is or above design is pretty significant. Darren, could you drill in a little bit on what you're seeing here? Is it changes to -- in the subsurface? Is it changes in the kit? Is it uptime? Kind of scale that for us And maybe just, I mean, there's really significant benefits if you roll it forward on a couple of the other projects that you have in the queue. So maybe just talk about how it's changing your view of the future opportunities? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes, sure. And thanks for the questions. That's something that frankly the organization has spent decades kind of working. I'll start by just -- I bucket it in three distinct buckets. First, it starts with the design and build out of the project itself. And so, having a projects organization with the capability that we've built and strengthened here over the last several years, we end up with facilities that have the right design and are built the right way so that we've got a really good platform to optimize and a good opportunity to squeeze to find opportunities to maximize and optimize the production coming out of the facilities without compromising any of the design specifications, staying well within safe operating envelopes. And we've done that over the years in a lot of our facilities. And I think this project organization even extends that capability with the skills that they bring to the project development and the build out. And then I'd say the second bucket is our operations organization and the focus that they put on maximizing utilization and production. And I think the mindset in the company is, once you've got steel on the ground, you've got this capital. The operations job is to run it reliably, run it safely, run it in an environmentally responsible way, but at the same time maximize the value of that steel in the ground and they've done a tremendous job of that. And it's not one big thing. It's a lot of little things that that organization stays focused on and pushes. And again, we've seen that not only in Guyana, but really all the capital projects that we've been bringing on the organization done a great job of making sure that we're maximizing the value of the capital that we've invested. And then the third bucket I would say is our technology organization. And again, we've taken the step to consolidate all of our technology organizations and move from what was a business oriented construct to a capabilities construct. And so, we've got our best people brought together working on our biggest opportunities. It's really driving innovation and creativity. And this close partnership that technology now has with the business and the shared commitment to drive value leads to more technology getting out in the field and assisting the operations group and squeezing. So I'd say all those are coming together. My expectation is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that, we're going to see the first two FPSOs get above 400,000 barrels a day as we continue to optimize and we'll do that in a very safe and environmentally responsible way. My expectation is when the third boat comes on with [indiscernible], we'll see similar levels of improvement there. And frankly, the expectation that we have for ourselves is that, as we build -- go forward and continue to build these projects, we'll continue to find the same kind of benefits and optimization opportunities with the projects and it comes back to this inherent capability that we built into our businesses. Stephen Richardson : Thanks so much. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Kathy Mikells : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Todd : Good morning. A question maybe on -- back on the upstream. I mean, even given the pricing environment, upstream performance that we've seen for the quarter, not just for you, but for the other peers that reported this week, have been a little weaker than expected with much of that seemingly driven by the global gas environment. Can you talk about drivers or headwinds that you maybe saw during the quarter on pricing relative to headline markers, maybe headwinds in trading or any other potential drivers there and how those might evolve over the remainder of this year? Darren Woods : I'll let Kathy maybe dive into a little more detail. I would just say, with respect to pricing and the impact on the business, actually our quarter came in pretty much in line with what we had expected. If you looked at the 8-K that we put out and our best attempt to model the impact. Just from the market environment, we are pretty rigorous in making sure that when we put an 8-K out there, it's really focused on discrete planned events, but much more importantly on what the market impact has been to the business quarter-on-quarter. And so I think that kind of laid out pretty consistently with what we expected. Obviously, gas prices were down, but I think refining margins are down a bit but still in very healthy territory. And if you look at the fundamentals, quite frankly, as we head into the back half of the year, I think as demand picks up, we're going to see limits that we have on additional supply, I think, come back into the mix and see the supply/demand tighten up a bit. So, my expectation is, the back half of the year, we'll see some an upward pressure just given demand changes in the limited options we have to significantly increase supply. Kathy, anything to add to that? Kathy Mikells : Yes. I'll mention a couple of other things to you. As a result of some of the divestments we've done over the past year, if you look at our gas portfolio, we're now about 45% LNG, so a little bit more tipped to LNG. If you just look at kind of impact of pricing across our gas portfolio and results, I mean, Henry Hub was down about 40%. TTF was down almost 50%. And the last thing I'd say is we always talk about the fact that on LNG a lot of our contracts are tied to lagged oil prices. And so, if you just look at where oil prices were in the fourth quarter kind of relative to where they are more currently, I'm going to call them down roughly $10 a barrel. And so, that pricing impact would have flowed through as well. And then the last thing that I will mention associated with our trading results is, if you exclude mark-to-market, so if you look in upstream, mark-to-market was a positive for us in the quarter. But if you exclude it mark-to-market, I would have then said our gas trading results were a little bit lighter this quarter. So kind of all of that packaged together, I think, gives you a pretty good understanding of our gas results. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about another energy transition area that's been receiving some attention in the media in terms of Exxon's activity, which is, lithium drilling and then refining. And it seems like you're waiting a bit more into the space. I'm wondering how you view that opportunity, given your expertise in drilling and refining of materials in the ground. And if that development in that space was contemplated at all in that $17 billion energy transition budget that you previously laid out? Thanks. Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. Maybe I'll just come back to kind of the fundamentals of how we think about ExxonMobil's participation in the transition space. And it comes back to the focus on leveraging the advantages that we have as a corporation where we believe we can add unique value. That's why we have, since the very beginning, stayed focused on what I'd say is the molecule side of the equation in carbon capture and hydrogen and biofuels. But we're looking at, frankly, all the areas that we believe we have an expertise and a unique capability and seeing if there's a fit for products or solutions that can help society decarbonize. Lithium and production of lithium from brine water is, if you think about what's required to do that is really an extension of a lot of the current capabilities that we have in our upstream. It requires a good understanding of the subsurface, requires a good understanding of reservoir management, requires drilling and injections. And so, I think the below surface things are very much in line with the skills and capabilities that we've built out over the decades in our upstream business. The processing of the brine and extracting the lithium is very consistent with a lot of the things that we do in our refineries and chemical plants and in fact, in some of our upstream operations. So that piece of the equation is, again, not new to the company. So as you look at all that, I think the capability, the skill set that we have, the operating experience that we have all lend themselves to that. And then, of course, there's the question of how does the market fundamentals look and supply and demand? And do we see a role for what we're doing there? And frankly, we've been looking at that for quite some time. I'd say we're still early in evaluating the opportunity, but we believe that by, again, applying our advantages in this space that we can bring on a much needed resource, lithium, one that's predicted to go short, we can bring it on at a much lower cost. And I think importantly, with much less environmental impact versus, say, the open mining that they're doing in other parts of the world. So this, to us, feels like a potential win-win-win opportunity, a win using our capabilities, a win from an environmental impact standpoint and a win in terms of supplying markets with a crucial component to electrification and EV. So, I think that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And we're, I'd say, actively exploring that opportunity set and like what we're seeing so far. Jason Gabelman : Great. That\u2019s really helpful color. Thanks. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein : Thanks. Good morning, guys. The cash balance is still around $30 billion for about four quarters now. And Kathy, last quarter, you mentioned that you were comfortable holding the larger balance because of the net positive spread in interest rates versus your debt cost. The spread is still there, so you're probably not in a rush to do anything, but just wondering if this is still the best use of cash versus deploying it into higher rate of return projects or buybacks. And if the forward curve holds the current kind of strip right now, can you foresee Exxon going into a net cash position next year? Thanks. Kathy Mikells : Sure. And so, we're pretty happy with our overall balance sheet position right now. And I've stated for a couple of quarters now that we expect our cash balance is going to ebb and flow a little bit just based on how the commodity price environment and margin environment ebbs and flows. So we think it's pretty critical to hang on to a really strong balance sheet because it gives us the flexibility that we need through the cycle. If you look overall at what we're doing from an investment perspective, I would say we're never trying to constrain the organization in terms of deploying good capital investments. And that's across our entire business. It includes our LCS business. Obviously, the acquisition of Denbury will enable us to accelerate the growth of our carbon capture and sequestration business within LCS. And we're excited about that opportunity and profitably growing that part of our business. So I think it's really important when we talk about capital deployment that we are not trying to constrain the company from new capital projects that can drive good returns for our shareholders. And that's how we create, I'd say, the virtuous cycle of how we can then support competitive growing dividends that are sustainable over the long term and a more consistent share repurchase program. So I'd say we're really happy with our balance sheet. We intend to hang on to a higher cash balance than the company has done historically just to give us more flexibility as we think about how we manage the company over the long term and through the cycles. Darren Woods : And just maybe to emphasize the point a third time that Kathy made, the mandate to the businesses is find advantaged projects that position us ahead of competition and deliver high returns, high value. And that's the mandate they've been given. And we will fund those opportunities as they come forward. I think what you see in terms of the -- what limits the investment is the ability, those opportunities -- to manifest those opportunities. And I think it's the challenge that we give our organization to only fund the things that we feel confident are robust to a very low price environment, are well ahead of other companies and tap into what I would say are the fundamental -- long-term fundamentals of the market. I think as we find those things and the organization is very focused on developing those opportunity set, we'll fund them because that's how you generate long-term value for the corporation and our shareholders. Josh Silverstein : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll go next to Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Thanks for the time. My question is on OFS costs, just your thoughts, both domestically and internationally for the remainder of the year and into 2024, how you're thinking about either inflation or deflation? Kathy Mikells : Yes. I mean, the way that we're thinking about inflation and whether it's oilfield services costs or other costs across the business, I'd say we've gone to a point where we're actually starting to see inflation come off in certain cost categories. If you think about some of the chemicals that we would use in unconventional, things like sand, what we would call tubular goods, which would include piping and valves and those types of things, we're starting to see some deflationary pressure now. As it relates to things where labor is a high component of the cost, I would say, we're not yet necessarily seeing that deflationary pressure coming through yet. But overall, I'd say it's probably too early to see much of that come through the second half of the year. But as we're looking forward into 2024, I'd say we fundamentally feel like inflation is going to come off as we're looking forward, because we're starting to see those signs across multiple categories now throughout the business. Neal Dingmann : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Darren Woods : Good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. You [indiscernible] to spend $17 billion in the low carbon business through 2027. Denbury sale acquisition is about 30%. And you're also saying that you're seeing a lot more opportunities. So should we interpret that your $17 billion that number, we'll need to -- will increase perhaps quite substantially? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Paul. I think as you rightly point out, the Denbury acquisition was not part of the $17 billion. And maybe just a little bit of perspective on that, given the we're just starting that business up, as you can imagine, very early and the opportunity set and progressing the opportunity set. I think Dan and his team in the Low Carbon Solutions business have made tremendous progress in bringing those opportunities to bear and manifesting contracts with customers as we've talked about with the three big customers that we now have and demonstrating that we can decarbonize some of these hard-to-decarbonize industries that don't have a lot of good alternatives. We've also got a very significant investment opportunity in Baytown to bring on the world's largest hydrogen plant. And then we've got opportunities for low carbon ammonia associated with that. So I think a pretty robust portfolio. And with the announcements of the deals that we've got to date, the commercial deals that we struck with the announcement of Denbury, I think a lot of recognition and interest by outside potential customers that there's a real opportunity here and that ExxonMobil provides a real solution. So that's the context. I would say the $17 billion as we -- that was -- looking at a portfolio of opportunities and then trying to assess how those -- how quickly those opportunities would manifest themselves in the capital that'd be required to do that, we're continuing that work. There's a lot -- and so as we continue to develop and make progress on these projects, some of the capital becomes more discrete, and we can see it a lot clearer, other deals move out. And so I'd say right now, it's a portfolio approach. We're not changing the $17 billion to date. Frankly, the Denbury acquisition, if that goes through, will allow us to pull back on some of the grassroots investments that we were making in logistics and substitute that with the assets that we brought in from Denbury. So it's, I'd say, kind of an evolving space. I think the thing to stay focused on, we're not going to compromise on our return criteria or the advantaged criteria that we're insisting on for the projects that we bring to bear. We have to be low-cost suppliers in this space. We have to be leveraging the advantages the corporation has, and we have to be generating good competitive returns. That's going to dictate the pace of the -- how quickly that CapEx manifests itself and frankly, the size of it. And as we go through this year's plan, I know Dan and his team are very focused on based on a year -- having a year under their belt of continuing to execute and drive this business. We'll develop more detailed plans and update that number. I don't know, Kathy, do you have anything you want to add for Paul? Kathy Mikells : Yes. Just the other thing I want to mention is, especially as it relates to the CCS business, what you're going to see over time is that, we're building a backlog. And that backlog is what's going to support the future growing CapEx kind of over the longer term and the profitable growth of that business. So today, I would describe ExxonMobil's backlog is 5 million tons annually, supported by three very large industrial customers, one in the industrial gas sector, one in the steel sector, one that makes ammonia that's used for fertilizer, right? And if you just think about what that does for society, those 5 million tons annually, that translates into the conversion of about 2 million cars from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. That's about all the cars around the road in the United States today. And when we talk about the overall CCS opportunity across the Gulf Coast, we talk about 100 million tons annually. That's 20 times that number. But I'm going to go back to the fact that it will be supported by customer backlog that supports a growing profitable business. So that's how you should think about it. Paul Cheng : Great. Thank you. Can I sneak in a real quick question? Kathy Mikells : Of course. Paul Cheng : Yes. Real quick. Darren, do you have a number, you can share what is the production for Permian this quarter -- in the second quarter? Kathy Mikells : 620 koebd. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet, Paul. Operator : I think we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up, actually, just looking at your volumes upstream. First of all, you mentioned that there was turnarounds and stuff, but I wondered if you could talk about the recovery, especially in the light of the stronger Guyana volumes, the fact that your upstream volumes are down quite hard here. Is that going to be a rapid recovery in Q3 and back towards what kind of levels should we expect for the rest of the year? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes. Sure, Paul, I'll take that. If you think about the first quarter, we were up pretty significantly, second quarter down from that first quarter, but essentially on plan with respect to the full year production levels that we talked about at the back end of last year when we put our plan forward. And I would tell you that there's nothing that we're seeing today that changes that guidance that we gave last year at 3.7 million barrels a day of production. So I'd say we're on track with that. We're not seeing anything that makes us change our mind. And obviously, we're working real hard to do better than that. But I would say, right now, we feel like we're on track to meet the plan and meet the numbers that we shared earlier last year. Paul Sankey : Can you say more about the downtimes that you had in Q2? Kathy Mikells : Yes. I'll just mention, we had given a bit of guidance to divestment and scheduled downtime. And that guidance was that we thought we'd see a reduction of about 110 koebd as I said what the actuals were across both of those items. It was actually 120 koebd, and that's a sequential number. So we were down sequentially 120 koebd as a result of divestments and the scheduled downtime. If you then just look at why was our overall production down a little bit more than that, it was really driven by two things. So we've seen curtailments and obviously, OPEC is cutting production, and so we have an impact coming from that. And then in terms of unscheduled downtime, we had a short strike in Nigeria that tipped up our unscheduled downtime. But again, I would go back to what Darren said, we had guided for the full year at about 3.7 million oil equivalent barrels a day. And if you look at our year-to-date numbers, we're up about 15,000 on a year-to-date basis year-over-year. Paul Sankey : That's super helpful. And then if I just follow up, if I look at your energy product sales, those are up just about as much, if not more, positively. Obviously, that's mostly Beaumont, I guess. But is there anything else to add there to the strength? Kathy Mikells : Yes. No, Beaumont is the main thing. And then we obviously had a bit less maintenance kind of going on, which helped our volumes as well. I'd mention that Beaumont was running at 90% utilization. So again, a really nice, I think, proof point and just the operational excellence across the company. Paul Sankey : Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much. Darren Woods : Thank you, Paul. Jennifer Driscoll : Thanks, everybody, for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on our Investors section of our website as soon as it's available early next week. Before we conclude, I have one important announcement to share with you. Please mark your calendars for the ExxonMobil Product Solutions Spotlight. It's going to be on Wednesday, September 20 at 1 :00 Central Time. Jack Williams, Senior Vice President, who oversees Product Solutions will be joined by Karen McGee, President of Product Solutions and several other leaders from ExxonMobil to talk about this new group formed in April 2022. For additional information about this upcoming event, watch the Investors section of our website. With that, have a nice weekend, everyone, and I'll turn it back to the operator to close it off. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

I\u2019ll now turn it over to Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please proceed, ma\u2019am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning everyone. Welcome to Exxon Mobil\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. We appreciate your joining the call today. I\u2019m Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President, Investor Relations. I\u2019m joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO, and Neil Chapman, Senior Vice President. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the third quarter earnings release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will provide brief opening comments and reference a few slides from his presentation, then we\u2019ll take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcements regarding Pioneer Natural Resources and Denbury, we\u2019ve included additional information on Slide 2 related to comments or information included in today\u2019s presentation. Please be aware that this presentation is not intended to be a solicitation of any vote for approval. During today\u2019s presentation, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Please note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website. Now please turn to Slide 4 for Darren\u2019s opening remarks. Darren Woods : Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. We delivered another robust quarter of earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns, reflecting our ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained industry-leading performance. We reported $9.1 billion of earnings, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to last quarter.  While the market provided a bit of tailwind, our success was enabled by the continued strength of our operational performance, which reflects the hard work of our people across the company. Whether it\u2019s continuing to drive efficiency in maintenance and turnarounds, running at high throughputs and utilization rates, or delivering big projects at first quintile cost and schedule, the excellent work of our people underpins our results and sustains our drive to deliver industry-leading performance in everything we do. The work is fundamentally strengthening the underlying earnings power of the company, establishing a strong foundation to deliver industry-leading results in any price environment.  Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share the success of the company with our shareholders. This morning, we were pleased to announce a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share. This year is our 41st consecutive year of annual dividend increases, a record that we\u2019re proud of and that we know our investors value highly. We continue to strengthen our portfolio of businesses by investing in advantaged high return opportunities while divesting businesses that are no longer a strategic fit. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our Thailand refinery, bringing our year-to-date cash proceeds from asset sales to more than $3 billion. We followed this in October with the close of the refinery sale in Italy. Recently announced acquisitions are great examples of the and equation, meeting the world\u2019s needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions. Acquiring Denbury strengthens our position to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries, which today have limited practical options. We see the potential to drive strong returns with the capacity to reduce the nation\u2019s carbon emissions by 100 million tons per year - that\u2019s 20 times our current CO2 off-take agreements with CF Industries, Linde and Nucor, which by themselves could reduce CO2 emissions by an amount equivalent to replacing two million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles currently on U.S. roads. We expect to close the transaction in early November with Denbury shareholders scheduled to vote next week. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in another all-stock transaction. This combination will further strengthen our already advantaged upstream portfolio and create significant value for the shareholders of both companies. Together, we will recover more resource more efficiently and with a lower environmental impact. We plan to accelerate Pioneer\u2019s Permian net zero ambition by 15 years and fully leverage their advances in water recycling. This deal is a win any way you look at it - good for our shareholders, good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for U.S. energy security. Neil will say more about the benefits of the transaction in a few moments. We\u2019re also continuing to drive profitable growth organically. In energy products, we achieved the highest third quarter refinery throughput on record, driven by our Beaumont refinery expansion. At a time of strong demand and low inventories, this project is providing 250,000 barrels per day of much needed new capacity to the market.  In addition, we recently started up our Baytown chemical expansion, which grows volume and improves mix. It provides 750,000 tons per year of new performance chemical capacity, including 350,000 tons of linear alpha olefins, marking our entry into this growing market. We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance with earnings of $9.1 billion and cash flow from operations of $16 billion. These results reflect the structural earnings improvements we\u2019ve delivered over the past several years as we\u2019ve improved our mix of assets and driven significant structural cost reductions, while maintaining our focus on industry-leading safety and reliability. We have lowered our structural costs by $9 billion since 2019, meeting our plan, and expect to deliver additional savings in the fourth quarter. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our base operations, including enhancing our maintenance and turnaround processes, strengthening our digital capabilities, and optimizing our supply chain. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with our full year guidance. Capex investments of $18.6 billion year-to-date are on plan. We expect 2023 capex to finish the year at the top end of our guidance range as we continue to invest in high return advantaged projects, our top priority for creating long term shareholder value. As always, we remain focused on sharing the company\u2019s success with our shareholders. We delivered $8.1 billion in shareholder distributions in the third quarter, $3.7 billion in dividends, and $4.4 billion in share repurchases.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Neil. Neil Chapman : Thanks Darren. Good morning everyone.  As we said with you recently, Pioneer is arguably the best Permian pure play company with the largest undeveloped Tier 1 inventory in the Midland basin. Pioneer\u2019s premier asset base is matched by the quality of its workforce. Its employees are innovative and hard working and possess a deep knowledge of unconventional operations in the Permian. When you combine these attributes with our technology and industry-leading operational capabilities, we\u2019re confident we can unlock far more value together than either of us could do alone. We expect synergies of approximately $1 billion before tax annually, beginning in the second year post closing, and an average of about $2 billion per year over the next decade driving double-digit returns. This transaction not only strengthens our current position but it also transforms our portfolio, increasing our exposure to short cycle low cost to supply liquids in the United States. Based on our initial assessment, we expect our combined Permian production to increase to approximately 2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by the end of 2027. Downstream, this merger also increases the integration between high value light Permian crude and our premier refinery and chemical footprint on the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Finally, we\u2019ve said many times that we\u2019re working to solve the end equation, providing the energy and products society needs and reducing emissions, both ours and others. This transaction reflects both parts of our commitment. We will increase our Permian production with plans to accelerate Pioneer\u2019s net zero plan to 2035 from 2050, and decrease our combined Permian emissions.  With that, I\u2019ll pass it to Jennifer. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you Neil.  We have two quick announcements to share with you. First, please mark your calendars for our annual corporate plan update scheduled for Wednesday, December 6 at 9 :00 am Central time. [Indiscernible] and Kathy are going to provide formal remarks and take live questions from our sell-side analysts [indiscernible]. Second, please keep an eye out for our 2024 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in mid-December. With that, we\u2019re going to begin our Q&A session. Please note we continue to ask analysts to limit yourselves to one question as a courtesy to others; however, please remain on the line in case we need any clarifications.  Operator, please bring us the first caller. Operator : Thank you Ms. Driscoll. The question and answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning and thanks for the update. The first question for me is on the Permian here. Slides 17 to 19 are interesting and incremental. I was wondering if you could take a moment to walk us through it. Just in the context of the investor feedback we\u2019ve gotten around the transaction, folks are looking for a little more clarity on the top line synergies that are going to come from better productivity. Thank you. Neil Chapman : Yes, good morning Neil. You know, what we outlined in the slide with the earnings release is really the basis of what I\u2019d always describe as real, quantifiable synergies that have created the deal space for this transaction. These synergies are already demonstrated in our existing operations, either in the Delaware of the Midland. It does not include the pipeline of new technologies that are either in the early stages of deployment or close to deployment. By applying what we\u2019ve already demonstrated, we\u2019re confident we can recover an additional 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels, more than either Pioneer or industry could have demonstrated with their existing performance. In the charts, we highlight two areas. One, industry\u2019s move to cube development. We\u2019ve moved to cube development to get the higher net present value. We were the pioneer in that, and that\u2019s obviously to avoid the parent-child impact. The top chart on there shows that we\u2019ve been drilling cube since 2020 100% in the Midland, and you can see that over the period, Pioneer has moved to 100% cubes as well. In 2022, when we were both developing 100% cubes, you can see we\u2019ve got equivalent recovery rates, but we\u2019re at notably lower quality acreage, lower quality resource, so equivalent recovery at lower quality resource, and when we look at truly comparable acreage, and that\u2019s really, really important because generalizations can lead to misleading results. In the bottom, we talk about adjacent Martin County, where us and Pioneer and one of our other peers are drilling the same 10,000 lateral cubes, you can see we get a 20% higher recovery, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all targeting the same intervals. These are [indiscernible] in similar proportions. What varies and what\u2019s the difference is the stacking and landing zones, and what varies is the optimal wealth spacing that we are delivering, which includes things like vertical orientation. Just one final point on that, Neil, in terms of recovery - it\u2019s not just about how you deliver cubes. When you\u2019ve got better recovery, when you\u2019ve got better capital efficiency, it gives access to economically developing what we would describe as secondary benches. As you\u2019ll recall, like the Wolfcamp C and like the [indiscernible] mill extension, and in addition obviously we have other techniques that we attempt to keep confidential, which gives us this higher level of recovery. Neil Mehta : Thank you Neil. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Good morning. When you talk about your two million barrel a day initial sort of view of where production from the combined entity can get to in 2027, how do I think about the gating factor? Is that a fixed rig or activity or capex program and the volume is an outcome, or is that a volume target and you\u2019ll adjust activity down as more synergies come through? Neil Chapman : Yes Bob, it\u2019s Neil again. I want to be clear - we don\u2019t have a volume target. We have a value target, we have a volume outcome, and that\u2019s really, really important. For our basis, we\u2019ve talked about an outcome being a million barrels a day by the end of 2027 based on our Delaware and Midland Basin. Based on our initial assessments of Pioneer\u2019s plans, obviously we\u2019ve had access to that through the due diligence process, we see that with similar capital spending as Pioneer has today, and you can equate that to a similar number of rigs, we would anticipate that Pioneer\u2019s production under Exxon Mobil and Pioneer\u2019s combined operations would also get to a million barrels a day by the end of 2027.  If you add current production in the Midland Basin from both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil today, it\u2019s already at a million barrels a day. It\u2019s really important, though - volume is an outcome. We\u2019re striving for the value, that\u2019s why we focus on the cube development. But I would say the basis is consistent with existing capital spending that Pioneer are making today. We do anticipate, as I\u2019ve just outlined, improvements in recovery. We do anticipate improvements in capital efficiency based on the synergies that we outlined in the earnings release, but that\u2019s not really built into that outlook of a million barrels a day from the Pioneer operations. Bob Brackett : Very clear, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Devin McDermott : Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to stick with upstream and take advantage of having you on the call here, Neil, and ask about Guyana. The slide noted that production is now coming in ahead of plan for the full year, a little bit better than your full year target, and part of that is the Payara start-up, part of that seems to be debottlenecking. I want to just focus on the debottlenecking opportunity. Could you walk us through how much uplift you\u2019ve realized so far versus nameplate, how much is left, and then the repeatability of this outperformance as we look at the additional FPSOs that are set to start up over the next few years. Neil Chapman : Yes, thank you. We\u2019re really encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in Guyana. Let\u2019s just start with the two boats that are in our operation today. Liza 1, or Destiny had a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re consistently running that at about 150,000 barrels a day. Liza 2, Unity was a 220 capacity and we\u2019ve been running that consistently above 240,000 barrels a day, so those two combined are getting close to 400,000 barrels a day, which is quite a bit, and this comes from, I would just say, good operational performance. You look at every aspect of the operations, you tweak them, you push them, and you can get more and more out.  Now, we\u2019re starting up Payara, which is 220,000 barrels a day nameplate capacity. We would hope we would expect to have a similar type of uplift. There is no reason to think that we wouldn\u2019t. We have to start that up--the plan is to start that up in the middle of November, and that would give us a combined nameplate capacity of 560,000 barrels a day, but obviously with the first two boats running more like 400,000 barrels, we expect to be in excess of 600,000 barrels a day of production.  Just to add to that, we\u2019ve got three more boats in the pipeline, as you\u2019re aware. All three of the boats in the pipeline - that\u2019s the Yellowtail, Uaru, and then Whiptail, these are all larger boats, they\u2019re all 250,000 barrels a day. Yellowtail and Uara are in construction. Whiptail, we\u2019ve submitted the development plan to the government, and we would hope and expect to reach FID in 2024 for that, and that will give us a combined nameplate capacity of 1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2027, but that doesn\u2019t include the uplift in performance--production performance that we\u2019ve got on the first two boats. You know, we were certainly--our message to the organization is start it up safely, start it up on time, each boat - that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do on Payara, and once we get settled, we\u2019ll try and follow the same protocols that we\u2019ve done on the first two boats and strive to get maximum production out of the boat, and that\u2019s obviously good for the shareholders, it\u2019s good for the co-ventures, and it\u2019s even better for the country. Darren Woods : Yes, I would add to Neil\u2019s comment, if you recall, we brought all our projects organization together to make sure that we were leveraging the best capability in terms of development in designing these projects. We\u2019ve also brought together our technology organizations, and the big benefit we have there is we\u2019re now leveraging not only the capacity that was in the upstream in terms of optimization around these facilities, but we\u2019ve decades and decades of experience of people optimizing and running our chemical plants and our refinery facilities to squeeze out and optimize every piece of the production pipeline and make sure that we are at the designed limits of the different equipment. That optimization, which has been kind of the lifeblood of the refining business, given the very narrow margins, has big payoffs when we apply it to the upstream facilities, and so there\u2019s an additional benefit just in terms of leveraging the broader organizational capability, which again has been part of our strategy from the very beginning, is to make sure that we\u2019re bringing to bear the best thinking across the corporation on the most important facilities and projects, and this is certainly one of those. Devin McDermott : Great, thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open, please go ahead. Doug Leggate : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning everyone.  Darren, forgive me - I\u2019d like also to take advantage of Neil being on the call and follow on with a Guyana question, if I may. Neil, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to frame this question a little bit because a couple of years ago, you talked about if the deeper resource potential proved to be as prolific as the original targets that you had in the area, you could look to double your resource potential from 10 - at that time, you had announced potentially significantly larger. You haven\u2019t updated that resource number in a while. Now, you\u2019ve got Lancentfish, it looks like Fangtooth is in the queue based on your EIS submissions to Guyana, but yet you still talk about production capacity and not production. My question to you is with capability obviously keeping these boats filled for an extended period of time, what do you ultimately see as the production capacity--sorry, actual production as opposed to capacity trajectory through the end of the decade at this point? Neil Chapman : Yes, thanks Doug. There\u2019s probably two parts to that question. One is exploration and then one is production and capacity. Let me just handle exploration first. You know, we\u2019ve had, as you\u2019re aware, three discoveries this year, including Lancetfish-2, which is the most recent one. We continue to integrate those results, both of exploration and appraisal drilling, and we\u2019re going to update that resource base when we see it is a significant change.  Our program of exploration and appraisal continues, and the way I like to frame it is in the southeast corner of the Stabroek Block, we\u2019re continuing to appraise around our discoveries, and that will take a lot of work and a lot of activity. You know we have six drill ships in the basin and they\u2019re both--they\u2019re in development appraisal and exploration drilling.  In addition to all that appraisal drilling that we\u2019re doing in the southeast part of the block, we\u2019re looking for what I would describe as anchor prospects further to the north and further to the west. We continue to look and we\u2019ve probably got order of magnitude three, what I\u2019d call true wildcats or exploration targets, looking for [indiscernible] wells in the next 10 to 12 months, something like that. That can change based on results of either the appraisal or the exploration drilling. You know, we\u2019re going to update when we see something meaningful and when we see something significant. We\u2019ve been very clear that we had six FPSOs in the pipeline - they are firm and I just in one of the previous questions outlined all of those. Indeed, they will have a capacity and you strive to keep them full all the time. As you know, Doug, one of the beauties about the Stabroek Block is the density of the resource and the proximity of these boats, which gives that potential for tie-backs well into the future. But the water cut will increase, as everybody knows, in deepwater, so we constantly look. We like to talk about capacity and we optimize as we go, and we will increase the production versus the nameplate capacity as we go, and so that\u2019s why I think what we can be firm on is we will have six boats by the end of 2027, they will have a nameplate capacity of 1.2, and obviously we will strive to keep them as full of liquids or of oil as we can over that period. I think as we get closer to 2027, obviously we will update those numbers, Doug. Doug Leggatte : Appreciate the full answer, Neil. Thanks so much. Neil Chapman : Yes, sure. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead. Stephen Richardson : Great, thank you. We\u2019re going to keep Neil busy this morning. Another one on the Pioneer disclosure - appreciate the incrementals. Neil, I guess it sounds like from your previous comments, the million barrels a day target, that output is still there from the legacy composition and you\u2019re thinking about the additive from Pioneer. Can you talk a little bit about as you integrate the two assets, are you assuming some high grading around some of the higher quality acreage? Do you envision prioritizing more activity on one asset versus the other, or are you still kind of thinking about them as two separates? Also, maybe you can just talk a little bit about assumptions around acreage bolt-ons or any positions as well. Is there a lot of work to do in terms of extending some of this lateral length that you\u2019re talking about? Thanks very much. Neil Chapman : Yes, first of all, I would say it\u2019s very early in the process, of course. We\u2019ve done the due diligence, we\u2019re into transition now. I think it\u2019s very important to make the point, Pioneer are a very, very capable organization. They\u2019ve demonstrated that. What we\u2019re really excited about is the combination of these two organizations. Pioneer has a deep, deep understanding of the Midland Basin. As we\u2019ve talked about, this is absolutely in the fairway of Tier 1 quality resource, and Pioneer has done an exceptional job at developing that resource. For our side, we\u2019ve got a whole range of different operating techniques, development plans and technologies, and it\u2019s the integration of those that we\u2019re most excited about. Everything we\u2019re seeing in the initial transition work would suggest all of that is correct. If you just look at the acreage position and you look at where Exxon are--Exxon Mobil are and Pioneer are, obviously it gives an opportunity for both high grading the inventory, and that includes bolt-ons. I have to say that Scott Sheffield and his organization have done an extraordinary job bolting on and increasing their acreage in the basin, and they have a very, very capable land organization, and we look forward to working with those firms. I think it\u2019s a combination that\u2019s going to be most powerful in developing that resource. Darren Woods : I\u2019d just add to what Neil said, if you look at what we\u2019ve been doing over the last six years, it\u2019s really been around integrating our organizations, consolidating them, and making sure that we\u2019re concentrating like capabilities into the same organization, and that is paying huge dividends. This is no different. The intent is to fully integrate the Pioneer organization and its people into our business. My expectation is we\u2019ll bring a lot of advantages to their acreage, but at the same time, we expect their people to bring a lot of advantages to other parts of our business, including what we\u2019re doing in the Delaware.  Our whole strategy is really around the value you create by taking experts in areas and getting the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that, so there won\u2019t be a separate approach here. It will be one. I think what you\u2019re seeing today, to Neil\u2019s point, the fact that we\u2019re in very early stage, but as we get together and work through the plans and the development, it will be one seamless integrated organization and plan. Neil Chapman : Steve, just one small addition to illustrate that. I\u2019ve talked before that we have a basin-wide remote operations centers in Houston where we control all our operations in Houston - that\u2019s drilling, that\u2019s fracking, the field operations, that\u2019s methane tracking, methane emissions tracking as well from one central control center in Houston. Obviously our plan would be to bring in the whole Pioneer operations in time to have one central organization. What this gives you is it gives you all that competency, all that expertise, applies is to the whole of Midland Delaware Basins from one central control center. Stephen Richardson : Thanks very much. Operator : The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead. Roger Read : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Keeping with the upstream theme here, I\u2019d like to dig into the, I guess call it a slight transition here, the high value-added or high margin liquid barrels, so specifically the comment, 100,000 barrels a day higher versus 2022\u2019s gases declined or been sold, and the liquids have grown. But as you think about the change out to 2027, the growth in Guyana, the growth in the Permian, and we compare that to where you were, say in 2019, how do you think about the total value-added liquid barrels, the impact on margins, the impact on returns? What\u2019s the right way for us to think about the transition of the company over roughly that eight-year period? Neil Chapman : Roger, it\u2019s Neil again. Let\u2019s just park the Pioneer acquisition for a moment and just talk about our existing plans as Exxon Mobil. Back in 2018 and 2019, I talked about the strength of our developments that we had in the pipeline, and obviously they were headlined by Guyana and by the Permian. What I said at the time is what you will see is an increase in the percent of liquids in our portfolio and a reduction in the percent of dry gas of the total.  If I outlook to 2027, we will go from something sub-65% liquids to something around 70% liquids in our portfolio in 2027, and 15% or thereabouts of liquefied natural gas, so that takes us up to 85%, I would call liquids index. Obviously 80% of our LNG sales index to Brent or to crude oil. That\u2019s a big transition but it\u2019s driven by the quality of those resources, primarily in the Permian and Guyana, and we\u2019re going to be adding onto that, of course, the programs we have developed we have in LNG in Papua New Guinea and then in Mozambique at the end of the decade. I\u2019d just add one other comment - if you take the liquids and the LNG, which would take us to 85% liquids indexed in 2027, of the gas that remains, 7% of that is associated gas, so in other words gas associated with liquids production. You can see that we\u2019ll be in the order of magnitude of 7% or 8% of dry gas in our portfolio at that time, and that\u2019s pre the Pioneer acquisition. Darren Woods : I\u2019d just add to that, Roger, if you just step back and think more conceptually around the strategy and what we\u2019re trying to do, every one of our businesses is focused on moving to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that we remain robust to any period in the commodity cycle and making sure that we\u2019re positioned competitively versus everyone else in the industry. That drive over time to reshape the portfolio continues to move our collective production to the left and to lower cost, and then at the same time adding higher value barrels, we\u2019re lowering cost and increasing revenue, and so that\u2019s where the value game is getting played out. That\u2019s the work that we\u2019ve been doing and that\u2019s the high grading that you\u2019ve seen in the portfolio and the improvements in structural cost. We mentioned at the top of the meeting that we\u2019ve actually achieved the $9 billion in structural cost this quarter, third quarter, so a quarter ahead of what our initial plans were, and we expect to see more in the fourth quarter. As we go forward with the changes that we\u2019ve been making in the organization continuing, we\u2019re going to continue to deliver more structural cost savings.  The whole strategy is around making sure that we have the best portfolio and the most resilient portfolio, so that we can basically be successful irrespective of the commodity price environment that we\u2019re in, and that we\u2019re well positioned versus others in the industry. That is the strategy, and you see that playing out certainly in the upstream, but you also seeing it playing out in the downstream where we\u2019ve been high grading our assets there and playing out in our chemical business, where we continue to bring on units that produce high performance products. That strategy is manifesting itself in each of our businesses. Then I\u2019ll just end on that same philosophy underpins what we\u2019re doing in low carbon solution. As we build out that business and position ourselves for the long term, it\u2019s making sure that every investment that we\u2019re making, every value chain that we\u2019re creating, that Dan and his team have a clear view about where that will sit in the cost supply curve, or you can think of it as the cost of abatement curve, and making sure that we\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry. Roger Read : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Royall of JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  My question is on the capex. Could you maybe help us bridge the top end that you\u2019re guiding to now for this year versus maybe the midpoint? It\u2019s a tight range, so not super material, but just any color there would be helpful. Then I know you\u2019ll give your update in December, but is there any color you can give us directionally on what you\u2019re thinking of for next year on the legacy business, prior to layering in Pioneer? Just anything on the moving pieces for capex next year would be great, thank you. Kathryn Mikells : I would say nothing really unusual going on in capex. As you stated, it was a pretty tight range to start with, obviously with a focus on us looking to ensure that we\u2019re investing in advantaged high return projects - that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re delivering, so I would characterize this as updated guidance that\u2019s pretty consistent with our plans, and we can give you a further update when we get to that corporate plan discussion later on in December, but we feel very good about our overall execution.  As Darren mentioned earlier, we\u2019re bringing projects online at a cost and schedule that\u2019s typically within the top quintile, so we feel really good about our capabilities and our execution and our ongoing focus with our highest priority, ensuring that we\u2019re executing great projects with high returns for our shareholders. Darren Woods : I might just add to that, as we think about capex, we provide that range because we recognized going into the year that things move around a bit, and as we prosecute a plan that with time, we find additional opportunities as things move around. If you look at where we\u2019re at through the third quarter, we are right on our plan, and so as we move forward, we\u2019re going to continue to do the things that we had planned to do last year, but I would say we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to build on the value proposition. If we see it, we\u2019re going to go after it. We\u2019re not going to constrain ourselves artificially to a guidance range if we find an opportunity set; but to date, things are moving pretty consistent with where we thought we were going to be, and frankly as we look out going forward, continue to see a very consistent set of opportunity sets that we\u2019re going to prosecute. I think the one change that we\u2019ll spend more time talking about in low carbon solutions is as that business matures and we establish, I\u2019d say, an advantaged position, there are a lot of opportunities coming our way, so we\u2019re working our way through those opportunities and making sure that we focus on the highest priority ones, the ones that generate the most value and are competitive in our portfolio. We\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into the plan release. John Royall : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead. Jason Gabelman : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot\u2019s happened in the past few months, but about three months ago, there was a handful of news articles about Exxon\u2019s lithium endeavors. I just wanted to get an update on that. Are you still drilling in the Smackover for lithium, are you exploring potential processing unit there, and how have things trended the past few months? Do you expect that to figure into your growth plans here over the next five years? Thanks. Darren Woods : Sure, I\u2019ll take that. I think just stepping back and maybe setting the context of what we\u2019re trying to do, I\u2019ll call it in the transition space, and frankly more broadly, go back to the fundamental of what are our key technology competencies and capabilities, and then what businesses lend themselves to those capabilities where we can carve out an advantage and produce the products society needs. Rather than chase what I would say is the current narrative or the current conventional wisdom as to what the world is going to need, it\u2019s focus first on what we can fundamentally contribute and bring an advantage to and therefore generate returns higher than the rest of industry, and then figure out how those advantages apply themselves to what the world needs.  Obviously lithium is an important part of the transition going forward in electrification and the need for batteries and storage of power and energy, and so we\u2019ve looked at that space and clearly with the opportunity at Smackover and the ability to drill, extract the lithium from the brine water and re-inject that, it\u2019s got a much lower environmental impact than the current production process for lithium. It fits very well with our capabilities and on the cost of supply curve, it\u2019s very competitive, so it looks attractive, and the challenge that we\u2019ve been giving to Dan and his team is to develop a business plan where that becomes material with respect to what Exxon Mobil--Exxon Mobil\u2019s portfolio, and effectively competes for capital. As Dan and his team develop that concept and that potential business, that\u2019s looking more and more promising, and we see an opportunity to really leverage the things that we\u2019re pretty good at in the base case, and it\u2019s very synergistic with our traditional businesses. I think when we come out and talk about the plan, we\u2019ll talk more about where we see the lithium business going, but it looks fairly promising at this stage. I would just say, the aperture\u2019s wide open. I think for a long time, we\u2019ve been characterized as an energy company, and that almost discounts what is one of the world\u2019s largest chemical businesses, which we feel pretty good about. It comes back to this fundamental capability of managing and transforming hydrogen and carbon molecules to products that the world needs and leveraging our capabilities, and lithium fits into that along with our other businesses in bio-fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage. We\u2019ll continue to develop those, and again, as I said earlier, seeing that opportunity space and the opportunity to generate higher return projects is looking more and more promising, so I would expect that to be part of the portfolio going forward. Jason Gabelman : Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Your line is open, please go ahead. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe one follow-up on some of the earlier Permian conversation. You were always known as developing your side of the Permian on a very long term plan. You\u2019d built out a lot of infrastructure early on. On the infrastructure side, as you think about this post the Pioneer transaction on infrastructure, do you have the combined infrastructure in place that you need to arrive at the 2 million barrels a day of combined production? Will this require any additional infrastructure spend or any shift around in how you think about things versus previously anticipated, and maybe just any comments on whether you see any potential bottlenecks in the basin over the next few years. Neil Chapman : Yes Ryan, it\u2019s Neil. I\u2019ll take that question. I think as you\u2019re aware, there is a big difference between the Delaware and the Midland Basins. The Midland Basin has got far more mature infrastructure, and I would say that Pioneer has done an exceptional job in both developing and acquiring and contracting both infrastructure to exit product and for water. It\u2019s quite a difference versus the Delaware. Of course, in the Delaware, we had to put in that infrastructure in place. We did it at scale, we built this large central processing facility called Cowboy. We currently have a capacity there of about 250,000 barrels a day of crude and about 400 Mcfd of gas. We plan to expand that.  In the Midland, most of that infrastructure already exists. There is always going to be incremental investment, but nothing like the scale, Ryan, that we have seen in the Delaware. I feel very good about the infrastructure we\u2019ve put in place in the Delaware, and we made that investment upfront. We talked about it in 2018 and 2019, and we\u2019re clearly benefiting from that investment that we made now. Quite a contrast in the Midland. Darren Woods : Yes, I would add to that, if you go back in time, as we were looking at the integrated value chain, we were certainly focused on the molecules that we were producing in the Permian but we also recognized it was an opportunity for us to take advantage of the geographic locale and the proximity to our facilities in the Gulf Coast to optimize broader Permian production, and so we built the logistics systems, pipeline systems and the capability within our facilities to manage that. What we\u2019re now going to be bringing into the portfolio in the Midland fits very well with this broader play of an integrated value chain and making sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value of those molecules through our own facilities. As we said early on when we first introduced this deal, that piece of the equation, which we believe there is a value opportunity on in terms of better managing the molecules from end to end, from the crude clear through to the finished products, we believe there\u2019s additional opportunity there. We\u2019ve got to get in and work through the details of that. My view is that\u2019s additional upside to what we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s one I feel really good about and the one that, frankly, we anticipated early on by making sure that we\u2019d built the capacity ahead of actually needing it for our own molecules, so we\u2019re in a very good position there. Neil Chapman : And Ryan, I didn\u2019t answer your question - do we anticipate any bottlenecks, and the answer to that is based on what we have seen so far during the transition work and the due diligence, the answer is no, we don\u2019t see any bottlenecks in getting to the production levels that we anticipate. Ryan Todd : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is open, please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, thanks for the time. Darren, maybe for you or Kathy, my question is on shareholder return. It looks like you paid out a bit over 100% of free cash flow following the prior quarter - I think you were closer to even higher than that, maybe about 118%. I\u2019m just wondering, when you think about shareholder return, will you continue to lean into the buybacks as you look in the out years, or maybe just if you could give a little bit of color. I think I understand your role, your thoughts on the dividend side, so maybe I\u2019m asking a bit more on the share buybacks going forward. Thank you. Kathryn Mikells : I\u2019m happy to take that. If you look at our overall free cash flow results in the quarter, it was just under $12 billion at $11.7 billion, and we paid out $8.1 billion to shareholders, and that was between $3.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in the share repurchase program. In fact, in the quarter our cash balance actually went up $3.4 billion, and we ended the quarter at $33 billion, so I think you can see that in the quarter, we were in fact well under 100% in terms of what we paid out, which is what enables us to grow our cash balance and strengthen our balance sheet even further. You know, when you look overall at our approach to capital allocation, our priorities continue to be the same. First and foremost, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re investing in advantaged projects that are differentiated, are going to drive high returns for our shareholders. We do that both organically and, as you\u2019ve seen recently, inorganically as well, making sure we\u2019re maintaining a really strong balance sheet - we need that. Ultimately at some point, the cycle will turn against us and that balance sheet will be there for us to lean into, and being balanced in our approach as to how we share the success of the company and those rewards with our shareholders. I think you can continue to see that balance coming through between dividends and share repurchases. We\u2019re looking to be more consistent in our share repurchase program - again, I think you\u2019re seeing that. We continue to say we\u2019re on track to execute $17.5 billion of share repurchases this year. We\u2019ll complete that before the end of the year and we already have a program in place, a similar program in place for 2024, so we\u2019re trying to get that balance right. It\u2019s important that we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that can carry us through the cycle. Neal Dingmann : Thank you Kathy. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open, please go ahead. Paul Cheng : Thank you, good morning. Neil, the industry in the Permian, whether it\u2019s for emission reasons or for cost efficiency, seems to move and trying to electrify the operation as much as we could, can you share with us where is Exxon in that journey? How far are you in terms of electrifying your operation in the Permian, and when you\u2019re comparing to Pioneer, I don\u2019t know whether you have the information that you can share, and whether you guys are ahead of them or that this will be part of the $2 billion of synergy benefit, or that you\u2019re going to do more aggressively on that, this is going to be on top. Thank you. Neil Chapman : Yes, thanks Paul, good to hear from you. From our perspective, we have, I think, 17 rigs running right now in the Permian. All of those rigs are electrified, so we\u2019re 100% on rigs and we\u2019re working on fracs. Right now, I think we have one electric frac out of six frac crews running in the Permian. This is all part of our drive to get to Permian net zero that we said we would get to by 2030. Our plans are in place for that and we\u2019re on schedule for it. That program, it\u2019s simple as this - you have to reduce methane emissions. We\u2019re well on track with reducing methane emissions. We have no routine flaring in the Permian now. We\u2019ve replaced over 6,400 pneumatic devices, so you eliminate or your reduce methane emissions, then you electrify your operations, and as I\u2019ve just described, we\u2019re long way down the road in terms of electrification. Then we have to secure renewable electricity for those rigs and frac crews, and that\u2019s the program we\u2019re working on. In terms of Pioneer, I don\u2019t have those numbers for Pioneer in terms of where they are on electrification, but what we have said is that we\u2019re going to advance Pioneer\u2019s target to go to net zero from 2050 to 2035, so 15 years sooner than anticipated, and that will follow probably that same protocol, that same process of reducing methane, electrification, and then securing renewable electricity. Darren Woods : Yes, I would add to that, I think Scott and the team at Pioneer have been--this has been an area of focus for them, and I know they have worked hard to drive those down. The advantage that we bring is we\u2019ve got a large organization, more resources. We\u2019ve got a technical organization that has been leaning into this space and working broadly with the industry and other organizations to develop the technology to better manage methane. Neil talked about the central organization that we\u2019ve put in place to kind of monitor everything that\u2019s happening out in the unconventional space and make sure that we\u2019re responding in real time to things that we\u2019re seeing through this centralized operating center.  Bringing the Pioneer portfolio into that center and then allowing us to apply a lot of the work that, frankly, our scale and size has allowed us to advance, I think is going to make a big improvement in what we\u2019re doing with Pioneer, just by bringing additional capability there. I think the culture and the mindset is already in place. We\u2019re now going to bring some additional resources in to apply, and so my expectation is that we\u2019re going to see--we\u2019re going to raise the game here, just because we\u2019re bringing some additional capabilities to support what was already, I think, a very important focus for the Pioneer organization. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Is the savings on your electrification is already built into that $2 billion synergy benefit? Neil Chapman : Yes, in terms of the synergy benefits, as you know and we\u2019ve talked about many, many times, it\u2019s not just about the cost of the rig, it\u2019s about the quality of the rig and the performance of the rig, but electrification of those rigs doesn\u2019t really impact that. The electrification of all of those facilities is built into our plans going forward. Darren Woods : Yes, I would say our drive to bring their net zero commitment forward by 15 years, we\u2019ve also built that into our thinking around getting net synergies there, so we\u2019ve comprehended the additional effort required to improve the emissions profile and bring their net zero ambitions forward, so all that\u2019s netted with our synergy numbers. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is open, please go ahead. Josh Silverstein : Thanks, good morning everyone. On the Pioneer acquisition call, you had mentioned that the inventory of the combined companies in the Permian was around 15, 20 years. Was just curious how that may be split between the Pioneer asset and your Delaware asset, and does it contemplate the accelerated growth rate improves the outlying longer laterals or a potential plateau? I\u2019m just curious to get some more details there, because there was a view of Pioneer having over 20 years of inventory, so any more details there would be helpful. Thanks. Neil Chapman : Yes, I think Josh, it\u2019s early stages. I mean, the numbers that we gave and that you just referenced in our initial release are based on our understanding. We\u2019d certainly say that the combined resource for the two companies is order of magnitude 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels - that\u2019s 15 to 20 years life. Most of our resource is, as you\u2019re aware, is on the Delaware side. Obviously Pioneer is exclusive in the Midland side, so that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s based on our early assessments. Josh Silverstein : Well, maybe if there was just any more details as far as what your split may be of that 16 versus what theirs may be. Neil Chapman : Yes, I mean, they\u2019re close, I would say in total. Exxon\u2019s is closer to 9, Pioneer\u2019s is closer to 7, is what I would say in total, but that\u2019s based on our initial understanding. Darren Woods : For the resource. Neil Chapman : For the resource, yes. Josh Silverstein : Okay, that\u2019s it. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, please go ahead. Sam Margolin : Good morning, thanks for taking the question at the end.  I wanted to follow up on the capital allocation question and the dividend increase specifically. We\u2019ve talked a lot about this in the past, that this dividend increase looks like it\u2019s roughly the same as the amount of the share repurchase in terms of percentage, and I know you\u2019re issuing share for Pioneer but you\u2019ve also got a pathway to a lot of upstream growth and then downstream is growing too, as we learned about in the product solutions spotlight. You\u2019re running with sort of a significant operational cash surplus on a recurring basis, even before this growth, and so just wondering about your thoughts on dividend growth going forward and if we are through this period where you were tending the balance sheet and the portfolio, and now some of this growth will translate to sort of a dividend CAGR that is in line with the operations. Thanks. Kathryn Mikells : Sure, so we have always said we\u2019re looking to ensure we have a dividend that\u2019s sustainable, competitive and growing. I think the increase of $0.04 to the quarterly dividend is very reflective of that. I think it also reflects the overall confidence that we have in the business and the underlying improvement in earnings power that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. I mean, by any metric, this was a really strong quarter, whether you look at earnings, cash, shareholder returns. It was a very strong quarter and we have a great degree of confidence in the business, so we increased the dividend a bit more than we did about a year ago. Obviously we have a cadence now of looking at the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year, and that increase is very reflective of our confidence in the business and our underlying performance. Darren Woods : Yes, I would just add to that, Sam, obviously we view the dividend as a commitment, and as we saw through the pandemic, even when things get tough, we work hard to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to deliver on that commitment to our shareholders. As we think about going forward and the volatility in the markets and the commodity cycle, we do need to make sure that as we think about growth in the dividend, that we also think about sustainability and the ability to deliver on that commitment, irrespective of what the market throws at us. That goes into the equation as we think about that going forward, and when we\u2019ve got additional cash that we want to distribute, we\u2019ve always got the buyback, which obviously as Kathy said, we\u2019re looking to have a more consistent level of that as well. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. Thanks for the question. Sam Margolin : Thank you Jennifer Driscoll : You\u2019re welcome, and thanks everyone for joining the call and for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&A session on the investor website next week. We look forward to connecting with you again on December 6 for our corporate plan update. With that, have a nice weekend, everyone, and I\u2019ll turn it back to the Operator to conclude our call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead, ma'am. Jennifer Driscoll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. We appreciate you joining the call today. I'm Jennifer Driscoll, Vice President of Investor Relations. I'm joined today by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the fourth quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. Shortly, Darren will give you an overview of our 2023 performance. Then, we will take your questions. In conjunction with our recent announcement about acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources, we\u2019ve included additional information about the transaction on Slide 2. Please be aware that this presentation is not intended to be a solicitation of any vote or approval. During today's call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our cautionary statement on Slide 3. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, including an overview of full-year results, which are posted on the website. And now, I'll turn it over to Darren. Darren Woods : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I want to start with the theme of the quarter, which frankly, has been a theme of the year, excellence in execution. Whether it\u2019s operating our facilities, building projects, deploying technologies, trading, marketing, sales, supply chain, or any of our other activities, the men and women of ExxonMobil are setting and holding themselves to very high standards as they execute their responsibilities. Their hard work and commitment drove the strong results we reported today and are the foundation of our success. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about our people. They make the difference and are delivering industry-leading results. And nothing is more important than the safety of our people. Keeping them safe requires intense focus and relentless discipline, 24 hours a day, every single day. For many years we\u2019ve outperformed industry benchmarks for workplace safety. Over the last several years we\u2019ve been implementing improved systems for managing both personnel and process safety, leveraging best practices from across our company and industry, our own and others. These efforts are paying off with continued improvements in the number and severity of incidents. The discipline needed to consistently deliver industry-leading safety performance manifests itself in all our work. We see it in our project teams, who are delivering large capital projects at top-quintile performance on cost and schedule. We see it in the reliability of our operations, where we achieved record performance in both the upstream and refining. We see it in our environmental performance, where we set several new records. And we see it in the successful management of the transformational re-organizations we\u2019ve made over the last several years. Results are clear. By any measure, 2023 was an outstanding year. We delivered $36 billion of earnings, strong cash flows, and a 15% return on capital employed. Our strategy, introduced in 2018, coupled with consistently strong execution, is delivering results that lead industry across a range of metrics, including earnings and cash flow growth, total shareholder distributions, and total shareholder returns since 2019, the baseline year of our plans. On a constant-price basis, we more than doubled earnings in 2023 versus 2019, demonstrating the improved earnings power of the company. The growth in profitability reflects significant progress in high-grading our portfolio of assets through advantaged projects, divestment of less strategic operations, and significant cost reductions. During the year, our divestments generated more than $4 billion of cash proceeds. And we also announced two value-accretive acquisitions. Denbury, which closed in November, provides opportunities to profitably accelerate our Low Carbon Solutions business with a compelling, end-to-end, customer decarbonization offer. Pioneer, which is expected to close in the second quarter, will further differentiate our advantaged Upstream portfolio. The synergies will create significant shareholder value and accelerate Pioneer\u2019s net zero ambitions by 15 years, to 2035. In 2023, we made significant advances in a number of innovative solutions. We entered the lithium business, where we see an opportunity to supply approximately 1 million electric vehicles per year by 2030 with economically advantaged production that has a much smaller environmental impact than today\u2019s supply. In the carbon capture and storage space, we recently completed the construction of a pilot plant to further develop a unique, proprietary technology, which has the potential to significantly lower the cost of direct air capture. We also launched Proxxima, a thermoset resin with a high value in use for coatings, infrastructure, automotive parts, and wind power, made from low value components used in gasoline. We also took a further step in reducing cost, leveraging scale and improving effectiveness with the formation of three new centralized organizations, Global Supply, Trading, and Global Business Solutions. This change provides additional opportunities to grow deep expertise across a broad portfolio of critical business capabilities. Today, we\u2019re convinced that no other company can match the depth and breadth of development opportunities that ExxonMobil offers. It\u2019s no surprise that for the 11th year in a row, we were recognized as the most attractive US employer in the industry for engineering students. This is another key competitive advantage. Our plan for 2024 remains anchored in our existing strategy, building on world-class execution and the performance we delivered last year. We set a high bar for ourselves across all aspects of the business, from safety to operational excellence to financial performance, and have confidence in our team's ability to consistently deliver. For 2024, we expect to invest $23 billion to $25 billion to grow our portfolio of advantaged, low-cost of supply assets, further shift our product mix towards higher value, higher margin performance products, and reduce emissions, both our own and others. Our plan also continues to structurally reduce costs to achieve $15 billion in structural cost savings through 2027. We have opportunities to enhance supply chain efficiency, further improve maintenance and turnarounds, modernize data management, and simplify business processes. In Low Carbon Solutions, we\u2019ll continue the integration of Denbury and look to add additional customers to our US Gulf Coast network. As we noted during the Corporate Plan update in December, we\u2019re now pursuing more than $20 billion of lower emissions opportunities, evenly split between reducing our own emissions and reducing third-party emissions. Overall, our portfolio of low carbon investments is expected to generate returns of approximately 15%. Our Upstream portfolio will be further transformed when we close on the transaction with Pioneer. By combining the capabilities of our two companies and leveraging the advances we\u2019ve made in technology, we expect to recover more resource, more efficiently, with lower emissions. We\u2019ll provide more detail about this compelling combination at our Spotlight event following the close. Our results in 2023 once again demonstrated the strength of our strategy. As I reflect on the past year, I have tremendous pride in what our people accomplished and a strong level of confidence in our continued ability to lead in the years ahead. Finally, I want to thank our shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Now, I'll turn it back to Jennifer. Jennifer Driscoll : Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a courtesy to others in the queue, we ask all of our analysts to limit themselves to one question. However, please remain on the line in case you need any clarification. With that, operator, let's open the line for our first question. Operator : Thank you, Mrs. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yeah, good morning, Darren, team, and congrats on the strong results. My question was around the structural cost savings. So we're at $9.7 billion versus 2019 and targeting $15 billion by 2027. Can you talk about the progression over the next couple of years? What are the key buckets and milestones we should be watching out for as it relates to those cost savings? Darren Woods : Sure. Thanks, Neil. Good to hear from you again. Maybe just start with a little bit of perspective. If you think about where we have been driving efficiencies and what lies behind the improvements in structural cost. We've made tremendous changes in the organization and we've been doing that each successive year, sequenced with respect to what needs to come first, second, and third to make sure that we can effectively manage that. We're still in the early stages of taking advantage of all the changes that we've made going back in time with our global technology organization, with our product solutions organization that frankly brought refining together with our marketing and then together with chemical. So a lot of restructuring, a lot of opportunities, and all the organizations see a path to significantly improved effectiveness in executing the business and, to your point, a significant path to efficiencies. On top of that, we just launched our global supply chain organization. We just launched our global business solutions organization and our trading organization. So they're early in their process, and all of them see significant opportunities for efficiency. So I would say $9.7 billion is a reflection of the hard work coming from the reorganizations that we've done and we're early in that and then we've got additional reorganizations to take advantage of. That $15 billion that you referred to is not a target, it is in our plans and the plans reflect what the organizations are working on. So what are some of the areas? We've seen a lot of benefit today by a centralized approach to enhancing our maintenance and our turnaround processes. We've taken a lot of cost out with respect to that. We see an opportunity to bring further cost reductions there. The supply chain organization brings a huge opportunity. In the past, we had very fragmented supply chain organizations across all of our businesses. We've now consolidated all that. We see a lot of opportunities to bring together our data and our processes and harmonize those and do those consistently across all of the organization. And then a lot of continuing optimization within the base business, taking advantage of the new construct and learning from one another, that's a huge part of the go-forward reduction. So I would just tie all that to the ongoing change and the fact that we now have a good line of sight across all of our organizations around the best way to do things and the most efficient ways to do things. I'll hand it over to Kathy if there's anything to add to that. Kathy Mikells : The only other thing I would add is how we're looking to leverage technology to both drive incremental efficiency but as importantly to drive effectiveness. So things like how we use artificial intelligence and chat box in our customer care centers, right, which gives our customers better service. And obviously, that drives efficiency for the company. How we use predictive analytics and things like driving maintenance turnarounds to top kind of quintile type performance or similarly how we use those predictive analytics in our drilling and fracking centralized operation here in Houston. So bringing together our information technology organization with our engineering and research organization will just further enhance, I think, how overall we as a technology company fundamentally try to use technology to both drive efficiency but obviously to drive value in the business. Neil Mehta : Thank you, Kathy. Thanks, Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Neil. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Darren, 2018 was a long time ago obviously and a lot has changed since you pushed the doubling of cash flow from \u201825 to \u201827, including much greater and perhaps faster progress in Guyana. So I guess my question is, where do you -- where would you suggest we are in 2024 in moving towards that doubling of cash flow target, and specifically, what should we read about your CapEx comments in terms of the timing of Guyana as part of that target? Darren Woods : Yeah, good morning, Doug. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll start with the back end of your question around the CapEx. I mean, it should be clear, hopefully it's clear, we've provided guidance in a range in CapEx to give you a perspective of when we start the year based on the plans that we put together the previous year where we think we're going to end up and spend across the year. Obviously as we're going through the business, each of the businesses are clear on their objective to find value creative opportunities and to capture those as quickly as possible. So we've got an ongoing process. If we see an opportunity that we weren't aware of at the time of putting together the plan, we're not constraining our activities based on some artificial number or the guidance that we've put out. We're very focused on making sure that it's going to be an effective use of capital, that we can efficiently execute what's required for that capital, and then that there's value behind it and there's an advantage in it. So that's how we're managing. What we talked about in the release with respect to our CapEx in 2023 reflects just that, incremental optimizations as we're going through the year. And my view is we'll continue to do that as we go forward into the plan years. Obviously, we've given you some guidance that we believe reflect where we'll end up. But as we work the opportunities, we're very focused on that. I think, the short term, what we've done with Guyana, you're seeing today in Payara, where we brought that online. And frankly, in January, well ahead of our plans, reached nameplate capacity. And part of that was around the optimization of the drilling and making sure that we had what we needed to bring that up quickly. In terms of the broader objective to get to 2027, I mean we're on that plan and we're actually delivering the value that we laid out in 2018. So I feel really good about the progress we've made. We noted in the release that if you look at just from 2019, the year before the pandemic, the advances that we've made in the business, on a flat price, take margin, take price out of it, we've doubled the earnings capacity of the corporation from 2019 to 2023. We've grown earnings at compounded annual basis by 40%, greater than 40%. We've grown cash flow from operations almost 20%, greater than 15%. So I think significant progress we've demonstrated at the work that we're doing, projects that we've put in place, the reorganizations that we've executed, the cost that we're cutting out of the business are all driving us towards this improved valuation and frankly the plans we have going forward are going to continue to do that. So the targets that we've laid out, what we communicated in our December company plan release, basically those are plans and we feel that we're right on track if not slightly ahead of delivering on those. Kathy, anything to add to that? Kathy Mikells : Yeah, I mean, Doug, I'll just try to grind kind of back to those numbers a little bit more just so you understand that on an earnings basis, we actually more than doubled earnings on again that constant price basis that we used in our corporate plan which Darren is referring to in the numbers that he just mentioned. So I would absolutely say we are ahead of our plan in terms of what it is that we're achieving. And it's that earnings improvement that is flowing through to cash flow. And so as you think about cash flow, our earnings expectation in the corporate plan in terms of doubling it out to 2027, it's well ahead of doubling it. And then those earnings just flow through to the cash flow growth. So I would describe us as being ahead of plan in terms of where we stand today and feeling very good about the future. Doug Leggate : I think we would concur. Thank you very much indeed. Operator : The next question is from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I've gotten some inbounds this morning just on the 2023 spending. And, Darren, you kind of alluded to it in your response to the prior question. You were able to pull forward some CapEx for Guyana and Permian in 4Q. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the drivers of that, the types of efficiencies that you're seeing and what specifically you're able to accelerate and then how that influences your outlook for spending and production in both -- for both assets in 2024? Darren Woods : Well if you think about -- sure, and good morning, Devin. If you think about the complexity of what the organizations are dealing with and in particular the upstream that as we -- as you go through the course of the year, and they're drilling, and they're collecting data, and we're seeing the production, we've got a real-time optimization loop that takes the experience that we've had and builds it back into our go-forward plan. So it is a very dynamic process. And we've got, to Kathy's point, at lot of -- we're using a lot of technology to make sure that we're learning from all the data that we're collecting as we go and that we're adjusting our plans to optimize value. I would tell you, the organization understands it has an obligation to drive value and to find the value opportunities and to make sure that when we decide to spend money that we know that spend is going to be productive spend and that we're going to be efficient in executing that spend. And beyond that, they're not constrained. If they find that we're going to hit a constraint or we're going to hit something that's not incorporated in the plans, we have a conversation about that. So I would tell you it is a very well controlled process. Your point about capital coming forward in the fourth quarter, I would tell you the decisions that we made that led to going a little above the guidance weren't made in the fourth quarter. Those were made as we were going through the year with the recognition that if we took some of the steps as we were going through the year, that as we got to the end of the year, those numbers would grow potentially but up on -- well, slightly above the guidance. And we made the decisions as we were going. And it's a very dynamic process. So I think that's how I would think about it, that we're going to continue doing that going forward. Obviously, the Permian, we continue to learn with the technologies that we're bringing in there, the techniques that we keep evolving. So my expectation is we'll continue to adjust as we go to maximize the value of the production and what we're learning through the technologies that we're deploying. And then with Guyana, I mean don't underestimate the complexity of these reservoirs and the challenges the organization has. So as they're drilling and gaining information, we're optimizing that as we go as well. And if we see an opportunity to advance the development and bring it forward and bring [NPV] (ph) with that, we'll take that. And so I would just tell you, it's hard to predict because what are you going to learn? I mean, if we knew that now, it wouldn't be a learning. We'd know it. It would be built into the plan. So it's hard to really predict the learning piece of it. Anything to add, Kathy? Kathy Mikells : I\u2019d just say if you look at the specifics of what we delivered as a result of actually spending a little bit more on CapEx, I think you see that just goes hand in hand to how we drove value for shareholders. So in the Permian, we had guided to 600,000 kind of oil equivalent barrels, we came in at 620,000. In Guyana, we had said 380,000, we came in at 390,000 right? And you think about where we're at in Guyana today and we've got Prosperity, the third boat which is in the Payara development already up to nameplate capacity as we stand here today. And that's because we made the decision to drill more wells to ensure that we could get that boat up to capacity as quickly as possible and our organization absolutely delivered on that. So those were the right economic decisions that drove value for our shareholders. Devin McDermott : Great. Yeah, I agree the strategy is certainly yielding great results. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from John Royall of JP Morgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on Payara. You've expressed some confidence that you can ultimately get above the nameplate as you have on the first two platforms. Should we expect kind of a continuous ramp towards a higher number or does it run closer to nameplate for a period of time and then further unlock happens kind of more in a step change? Darren Woods : Yeah, good morning, John. Thanks for the question. I think, just maybe step back and talk a little bit about the process. Organization does its best to design the projects for the capacities that we want to deliver and then as they hand the cap, the projects group hands that off to the operating group. They're obviously, as they begin operation testing to see where we are with respect to constraints and every -- the advantage that we have here is that we've tried to stick to some consistent design. This design [won\u2019t build many] (ph) concept, we've tried to the extent possible, maintain consistency from boat to boat. Obviously, as the subsurface and the complexity of the developments change, we have to make adjustments. So it's not quite a cookie cutter approach, but we tried to maintain a level of consistency. One, because that keeps your capital cost down. But two, it allows us to take the learnings from the previous boats and apply it to the one we just started up, and advance things faster to do things quicker. And a great example for Prosperity is how quickly we managed to bring that unit up and get flaring down and get to nameplate capacity. That was -- we did that essentially at record times, which is a reflection of the fact that the organization as they've been bringing these units -- these production units on line that they're learning and then taking those learnings and forwarding it to the next post. So my expectation is you'll see us move faster and faster as we go. Difficult to predict exactly what that ramp up looks like or the step changes if you will because it'll be a function of what they bring into -- what the next constraint that they overcome to make sure that we can continue to run those facilities safely within all the operating limits but at the same time maximize their value. And so I would say take the previous ramp ups as a basis and then our expectation is the organization will find ways to do it even better. Kathy Mikells : And then if you don't mind, I'm just going to add because I know everybody is now going to be modeling what Guyana is going to look like for the year. So this is just a reminder that at some point in the second half we're working on the gas to energy project, right, and laying the pipeline down to bring that gas from Liza 1 and Liza 2 onshore, to basically kind of plug it into the power plant that ultimately will drive down costs for consumers in Guyana. And we will be taking Liza 1 and Liza 2 offline for a period of time as we kind of hook them up to that pipeline. So that's just a reminder that we'll have a little bit of downtime at some point in the second half. John Royall : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning all. At the risk of oversimplifying, if I think about 2023, it was a very strategy-focused year, Denbury, Pioneer, Lithium. If I look at 2025, it's a major project delivery year. 2024, is this a year of execution or could there be some level of strategic interesting moves that we should think about? Darren Woods : Yeah, good morning, Bob. I would just say you have oversimplified it. I would start with every year is a year of execution. And I think it's the fact that we have managed maybe in comparison to some of our peers to make it look easy and have executed, I think, at a high level. Make no mistake, the organization, that is a -- continues to be a real challenge across all of our operations. And I think the men and women of ExxonMobil have done an outstanding job of consistently executing to a very high standard, as I said in my prepared remarks. So I don't want to take anything away from that and I also don't want to suggest that we, for a minute, take that for granted or take our eye off of that ball. And so that's job number one. And even in bringing these projects online, that takes a tremendous amount of focus and discipline from an execution standpoint. So that is job one. And then obviously the strategy, that is also an emphasis every year. It's just, as we've always talked about, it's really a function of can we find the right opportunities, the right equation that brings value to our shareholders. And if it's M&A, it's got to be one plus one has to equal three or more. If it's a project, it's got to be advantageous, it's got to position ourselves on the very far left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. And so we've laid out what we know of and what we see ahead of us, certainly in the capital standpoint, but as the organization continues to execute and continues to look for ways to translate the strategy into bottom line value, we find new opportunities and then we don't hesitate to go after those if they meet our criteria with respect to the advantages and they are within our ability to effectively execute. So I wouldn't say 2024 there's any different emphasis than there was in 2023. The project piece of it, frankly that's the way the projects have been developed and kind of the work that's required to deliver those has led to that 2024 year of execution. But I wouldn't read more into that than just the scheduling of the projects. Bob Brackett : Very clear. Thanks. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you, Bob. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Great, thank you. Maybe if I could ask one, with the Denbury deal now closed, can you talk about what we might see over the course of the next year or two, particularly on the carbon capture business? Should we start to see announcements or notable signs of acceleration or efforts on that side? Darren Woods : Yeah, sure. I think the Denbury acquisition, just maybe a slight update on that first is, we've closed it, we've been going through the integration process and frankly continue to be very pleased with what we see as the opportunities to integrate that with the work we're doing around our Low Carbon Solutions business in carbon capture. So we see huge potential in terms of linking together all the opportunities to reduce emissions, high concentration emissions along the US Gulf Coast and along that pipeline system. So the team's doing a lot of work around developing the business there, a lot of work with potential customers around how we can help capture their emissions, and a lot of work around the operations and improving and growing the capacity of that pipeline. So all that's ongoing. My expectation is, with time, when we -- as we negotiate the opportunities with customers, we'll see more and more deals that bring emissions into that pipeline. That's certainly the plan. But I would tell you we're very focused on building this business for the long term. If you think about what we're trying to do there with respect to addressing the risk of climate change and significantly reducing emissions for third parties, that's a business that doesn't exist today anywhere in the world. We're trying to make sure that as the first mover here that we establish a very strong foundation for business that we expect to be around for decades to come. And so my guidance to the team is while we want to move quickly to reduce emissions and to get customers and to grow the volume of emissions we're reducing, we don't want to do that and sacrifice the value opportunity here. And so we're striking that balance. And I think what you'll see happen is, we'll bring on customers and grow that business in a way that is value-accretive and generates the returns that we need for the capital in that business. Ryan Todd : Okay, thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a question on gas realizations because they were just well ahead of, at least what we had modeled using the kind of rules of thumb and the portfolio mix you put out before. So is it just a case of the trading contribution coming into that number or is there something else driving that? And then just one quick clarification on the underlying cash flow from operations. Again, that was ahead of where the earnings beat would have suggested it would have been. So is there anything one-off in nature in the CFFO number that we should be aware of for 4Q? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yeah, I'll let Kathy address the cashflow thing. And I'll just say from a gas realization standpoint, I don't think there's anything unique in terms of what was realized as we went through the quarter. Obviously, we've been growing our trading business and that is going to manifest itself and our results, we're going to see that in our energy business, we're going to see that in our gas businesses. So that will continue to kind of, and as volatility changes and opportunities in the market change, we'll see that kind of ebb and flow. But we expect to see with time, a continued growth, structural improvement in the earnings with the work that we're doing in the trading space. And then I think quarter-on-quarter we're going to see changes in mix as we move across the quarters. And so we'll see some variation there. But I wouldn't put anything structurally other than the trading work that we've been doing and to our realizations. And I'll hand it to Kathy for any other comments on that and the cash flow. Kathy Mikells : Yep. And so I'll just speak specifically to cash flow from operations and I think you're referencing the quarter but I'm happy to talk about the quarter and the year. Our cash flow from operations, if you look at the quarter was $13.7 billion. If you exclude working capital, we would have been at $16.9 billion. You're mentioning a beat relative to the street, and so was there anything unusual going on? As I look at people's models, I think sometimes they struggle to get depreciation and amortization right, so that's the only thing I'm going to speak to. And when we have a quarter where we're taking impairments, then we get an increase kind of in terms of a non-cash add back that flows through to cash flow from operations and we obviously took an impairment in the quarter. So that's my best guess as to anything that might be nuanced. Otherwise, no, nothing particularly unusual going on. Biraj Borkhataria : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research. Sam Margolin : Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to come back to CapEx if possible, just because, when the organization's performing so well as it is, it feels like there's always going to be opportunities to pull something forward or for people throughout the organization to kind of pursue their incentives and spend a bit more. And obviously this is something that's been a topic in the industry for a long time. And so particularly like, as we look at your Permian results, it looks like your \u201823 wells are still improving and everything's getting better. So I guess the question is, how do we think about this with respect to your planning when it feels like there's always going to constantly be opportunities for you to add kind of nickels and dimes to CapEx to do some quick and high return opportunities? Thank you. Darren Woods : Good morning, Sam. I would -- I guess I'd take exception to the characterization that you've laid out there. It's not a function of the organization throwing additional nickels and dimes. We have pretty focused work programs to drive value here and frankly any discussion about spending additional money or making additional investments above and beyond what we've planned for has to come to the management committee. And so we've got pretty tight controls around making sure we understand what's the value proposition, how unique is the value proposition. This is not something we just turn loose to the organization and they start throwing on money as and when they see the opportunities to do that. So that's I think, the characterization that it's hard to hang on to this. I would think -- I would point to the success that we've had to date where we've delivered what is a very accretive advantaged set of capital projects. I think our track record demonstrates that we are not about going after volume or going after marginal investment opportunities. These things have to be unique. The hurdle to get into the capital plan is pretty high. We have -- if you look across the industry, we have a clear understanding of cost of supply. We know where we sit on the cost of supply curve. We know as new projects or opportunities come forward, we look at those in terms of where they sit from a competitive standpoint. They have to have a structural advantage. They have to be robust and resilient to the bottom of cycle conditions. If you lay all those conditions on, it's a fairly tight funnel that people have to get their spend through. And that doesn't change. That has not changed. And so I would just say, if we spend additional money, that money is going to deliver more than what was in the base plan frankly because it's on the margin. And I'll come back to, at the end of the day, we're not judging ourselves by basing -- by hitting some number that we've, or guidance that we've given from a year ago. We're judging ourselves on the ability to generate advantaged projects. And again, I just point you to the results that we are delivering. To grow earnings on a compounded basis at twice what the nearest competitor has done, or to grow cash flow from operations at twice what the next nearest competitor has done, doesn't come from investing in things that don't have the advantage that I just talked about. So I think our track record and the results that we're delivering demonstrate that the approach that we've taken here is working, and we're not going to vary off of that approach. Kathy Mikells : And then I\u2019d just add one more comment, and that is, we almost take for granted how many projects we've actually been able to pull forward and deliver either on time or ahead of time. And Payara is a great example of that. It was originally targeted to actually start up in 2024 and we were able to pull it forward. We were then able to pull forward incremental well drilling in order to get that FPSO up to operating nameplate capacity in an extraordinarily short amount of time. I'd say this is one of the areas that really differentiates ExxonMobil from other companies. Our top -- really top performance and execution and pulling projects forward is always a positive economic decision, right, because we're going to end up then getting the benefit of the profits from those projects sooner or later. So very much a decision that's aligned with driving value, which is what sits behind all of our decision making. Sam Margolin : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Yeah, hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to get your take on the outlook for the chemicals market going forward. 2023 was a bit of a trough year. Some of the industry participants are saying maybe we're getting close to turning the corner. And that would be meaningful given all the underlying investments that Exxon has made in the chemicals business. So just wondering your view on potential for market improvement and seeing the full force of some of those investments come through. Darren Woods : Sure. Good morning, Jason. Yeah, I think I would concur with your characterization of 2023 as being kind of at the bottom of the trough. It was definitely a challenging year, well below, I think, the bottoms of previous cycles. But I would say that, and we're quite proud of the fact that the investments that we've brought on were earnings and cash positive in the bottom of the cycle, which frankly is exactly in line with -- I was just talking about the strategy that we have and the criteria that we require our projects that they have to be robust to bottom of the cycle conditions. And in the chemical business, we definitely demonstrated that, that the projects -- the new projects that we've brought on, that have some run time in them, are earnings and cash positive, even in these very challenging conditions. So I think like many others in the chemical industry, we'd like to see us come out of the trough and when we do, our expectation is the capital that we've brought on will obviously be performing even better with better margins. I would say as well with respect to turning points, we have seen some -- we certainly saw in the fourth quarter some slight improvements. There's still a lot of capacity that's come on out there. We still see a reasonably good growth, particularly for ExxonMobil in our performance product category. We have set some pretty aggressive targets to grow our high performance, high value chemical products and we're seeing that happen. So we feel really good about the pipeline and the development of our sales. And then the question is when does the broader industry turn and you start to see margins improve? My expectation is 2024 might be marginally better than 2023, but we're not expecting significant change in the vector, but more of a gradual one as we work our way through all the supply that's come on in the recent years and some of the supply will come on in 2024 and 2025. So I think it will be a gradual recovery but frankly one that we feel very comfortable with based on the advantages that we have with our capacity, the advantages that we have with our footprint, and the flexibility we have to optimize on feed and products. So we're positioned for this kind of market. I think the results demonstrate that. And we're going to ride it and see where the market goes. Jason Gabelman : Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning. Paul Cheng : Darren and Kathy, I want to ask about the trading operation. I think it seems like it's a very good trading year for you and a lot of your peers in Europe. Can you help us to maybe quantify that? What is the trading benefit for the year, whether in terms of millions of dollars or in terms of improvement in the return and whether that you think that is a repeatable? And after more than the last two or three years, what have you learned? Is there anything that you will do differently going forward in your trading operation? And whether you see the first quarter optimization opportunity set, is it similar to what you\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter, or is it getting worse or getting better? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yeah, thank you, Paul, and good morning. I'll give you a perspective and then let Kathy build on that. And maybe just to go back in time a little bit, we talked about the trading opportunity within ExxonMobil for quite some time. I think there's some skepticism out there as to whether we could actually build that business. But the foundation of our trading operations is a function of the global footprint that we have, the span of the businesses that we have, the integrated nature of the businesses that we have that we felt like gave us a physical footprint and presence in markets all around the world to effectively trade on and to build a business from that footprint and obviously the perspectives and insights that come with operating that footprint in those mix of businesses. And that, I would say as we've grown our trading capability on that premise, optimizing our assets, building on our assets, that it has proven to be very effective, that that strategy is bearing out and that we see continued opportunity to grow that. And I think as we've talked about here, we were going to take a very measured approach and we weren't in a hurry, we weren't going to rush through this, we were going to make sure that what we do is structurally sound that we\u2019re not -- and that we're managing the risk as well as capturing the rewards and we've been doing that. So 2023 I think was off of the highs we saw in 2022 because of where the market is at, but still reflected, I think, very solid contributions based on the capabilities of the organization that we have been building. And we have got more to do there. My expectation is that you will see improved trading results embedded in our businesses because frankly those -- that trading organization's objective is to enhance the value of the businesses. We don't want a trading organization that's competing against the base business. We want a trading organization that's working with the base business to optimize value for the corporation. And they're doing that and those earnings accrue to the businesses that they're trading on behalf of. But I'm very pleased with what we saw in 2023. Obviously, the market and volatility is going to have a function -- will function heavily or play a heavy function year in year in terms of what we actually deliver. But structurally, we've got a really sound base that we're growing and I think we're going to continue to see improvement in that space. Kathy, anything to add? Kathy Mikells : Yeah, the only other thing that I'd add to that is if you looked at our trading results on a year-on-year basis, in upstream we were lapping kind of a big mark-to-market gain in 2022, right? So that impacted our results. And I've mentioned time and time again that quarterly results, especially as a result of that movement in mark-to-market, will kind of ebb and flow. And sometimes we get price timing nuances in the quarter. As we came to the end of this year, those price timing nuances that we saw in the third quarter had fully unwound by the fourth quarter. So I think we start the year overall in a pretty good place. Paul Cheng : Kathy, is there a number you can share in terms of what's the contribution for trading for the year? Kathy Mikells : No, we don't disclose that. And I think actually all our peers have a pretty high sensitivity to just -- competitive sensitivity in terms of disclosing that number. But I think Darren put overall things into a good context, which is last year was record earnings for the company and it was record trading earnings. And so we had a strong result this year in trading, but it was down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And then I mentioned specifically in upstream that we were lapping favorability in terms of mark-to-market favorable gain in 2022. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist. Neal Dingmann : Hi. Good morning, Darren and team. My question is on the Permian, specifically your continued record production to play. It appears, at least from what I'm seeing going forward, your [pro forma] (ph) Permian activity is likely to continue trending higher. And I'm just wondering, maybe, Darren, how you'd respond to maybe any critics who suggest all US companies should instead maintain flat production in order to, I guess, appease Saudi and the others maybe more so. Darren Woods : Yeah, well, thanks for the question. No, I would just tell you there's -- we're not going to run the business to appease an external member out there. I think the way we look at it is, can we find -- it comes back to every dollar that we choose to invest and spend. Do we see a return? Are we convinced that we're effectively spending that money and we're spending it efficiently? That's the criteria that we're using. That's the plans that we've built. We expect to grow our volumes in 2024 to about 650 Kbd. And then we're going to continue that growth through to the targets that we've laid out in 2027 of about a million barrels a day -- close to a million barrels a day. So that's the plan that we have. We're executing to that plan. And as we've said before, year-on-year, it's not straight ratable growth. It'll be lumpy growth. But over time, it'll average about 13%. And we haven't seen anything to date that would say that's going to change. Obviously as we bring Pioneer into the fold, we'll bring their production in and look to kind of optimize across that portfolio that both companies have. And as we've said before, that once we close on that, we'll come back out and have a spotlight where we share what the implications of bringing these two companies together and the impact on our Permian production. Neal Dingmann : Yeah, makes a ton of sense. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : The next question is from Lucas Herrmann of BNP Paribas. Lucas Herrmann : Yeah, thanks very much. And [glad to have the opportunity] (ph) to talk with you. Following on from the Permian question, actually, Darren, when you were asked about the pace of growth in 2024 in the Permian, I think the time of the capital budget release, one of the comments you made was a desire to build drilled uncompleted wells. I just wondered whether you could talk a little bit around the concept of building inventory, why the need, why put more wells into inventory? Is it very simply adding flexibility to the business in order to maintain the production profile going forward? So what's the thinking? Thank you. Darren Woods : Sure. Yeah, I'm happy to do that. And you remember correctly, we did say we were going to build some more DUCs. And I would think about that. And you used the right word, inventory, like any inventory that we have in the business, which is, if you're optimizing what is a pretty complex system of drilling and fracking and managing simultaneous ops and how you schedule all that and how it interfaces with each other and the planning piece of it, you want to have a little bit of inventory that allows you to continue at a pace and manage around some of the complexities and potential conflicts that you have in developing the acreage. And you'll recall that what we are doing in the Permian, in the Delaware in particular, is this manufacturing approach where we're laying out these spines and then executing like a manufacturing organization down that. So it is a very paced and continuum of work and production. So there are constraints that you hit as you're doing that consistently across all that acreage and having some DUCs available to us allows us to when we run into an issue with what we're doing in the immediate vicinity, we have some other opportunities to continue the production. So we use it like any other inventory. Now, obviously the trick is to get that inventory level right. You don't want a bunch of capital sitting there that isn't earning its return. This, we think we've got to an optimized level that allows us to keep a very efficient, I'd say, manufacturing process running versus a focus on production and production process. Lucas Herrmann : Thank you. That's helpful. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Jeoffrey Lambujon from Tudor, Pickering and Company. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good morning, everyone. Appreciate the time. Going back to carbon capture, I was interested in the comment early on about the pilot plan and the potential to lower the costs of direct air capture. Now, imagine there are limitations on what you can share just given, as you mentioned, the proprietary nature of the tech here. But with other key players in the energy space, particularly on the service side, exploring new technologies for this, just thought it would be great to get any commentary you can speak to on key learning so far from this pilot plan and the magnitude of potential savings. Where you see the most opportunity to improve the cost structure and what kind of capital investment that I guess the low carbon solutions business overall might involve over the near term? Darren Woods : Yeah, sure. I think, and you rightly so pointed out the proprietary nature, so I will limit some of the details of what we're talking about there, but maybe just from a broader contact standpoint, we're convinced that carbon capture is going to play a really important role in helping society meet its ambitions to get to net zero or to make certainly significant reductions in carbon emissions. I think it makes a lot of sense to, rather than tear up and throw away the existing infrastructure and the industries that we have in place that are intensive energy users, that we find a way to deal with the problem, which is the emissions. So I think carbon capture plays a role there. The technology that we have today, frankly, wasn't developed for this application. It has a use and can be deployed today for high concentration streams. But as you move down the emissions profile and get to lower and lower concentrations of CO2 streams, the existing technology is challenged. And so it becomes very expensive for every ton of carbon that you reduce. And so the challenge is use the existing technology today for these high concentration streams where you can make the economics work, but then find a lower cost method to deploy for these less concentrated streams that still make it economic. So that's been the challenge that we're working on, recognizing that the existing technology was designed for a different purpose. We need a new technology here and we're trying to take advantage of material science development, things have happened with materials, with nanostructures. There's a lot of advances in technology since the existing technology was developed. And so there's a question of how can we better capture CO2 by using advances in the existing technology. We think we've come up with an opportunity to potentially do that, but it's early days like all these technology developments. And so we built a pilot plant and we'll see and test out some of these new capabilities and test the cost effectiveness of capture. I'd say our first step, we're looking to get about a cost reduction of about half. But I would tell you that's still not enough. But if we can see a significant step change in that cost or path to that cost reduction, that gives us hope that we can then continue to advance that and get it back -- get it down to something that is more competitive and then economic to deploy across the world. If we can crack that nut, as I've said many times before, the holy grail in addressing emissions is direct air capture. And the challenge for the industry is to find ways to do that more cost effectively. And frankly, we're at the very early stages of the technology and the technology development. So whether we're successful or somebody else is successful, I feel like this is an area worth exploring. And I think our technology companies have got some great ideas, know how to scale things, know how to optimize not only materials but processes and bringing all that together to see if we can't make a step change here is the objective. And it's too early to judge how successful we'll be, but I certainly feel like we've got the capabilities and should be working hard to try to make advances here. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Great. Looking forward to your updates in the space there. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you. Jennifer Driscoll : Thanks, everybody, for joining our call today and for the questions you asked. We'll post a transcript of the Q&A session on our investor website later this week or early next week. Have a nice weekend everybody. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator to conclude our call. Operator : This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Marina Matselinskaya : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining the call today. I'm Marina Matselinskaya, Director of Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They are meant to accompany the first quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location.  During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are posted on the website.  And now please turn to Slide 3 for Darren's remarks. Darren Woods : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our strategy and the way our people are executing created significant value in the first quarter. We delivered $8.2 billion of earnings and $14.7 billion of cash flow. Even more important, we continue to strengthen the underlying earnings power of the company, which both Kathy and I will discuss in more detail on today's call.  An important driver of this improved earnings power is our ongoing focus on structural cost savings, which reached $10.1 billion in the quarter versus 2019, furthering our progress towards our goal of $15 billion by 2027. CapEx in the quarter was $5.8 billion, as we continue to invest in advantaged growth projects that will drive future earnings and cash flow. At the same time, we further strengthened our balance sheet, bringing our net debt-to-capital down to 3%, the lowest in more than a decade.  To reward our shareholders, we distributed $6.8 billion in cash, including $3.8 billion in dividends. For all of 2023, ExxonMobil was the third largest total dividend payer in the S&P 500. Only Microsoft and Apple paid more. We also repurchased about $3 billion of shares. Buybacks were temporarily paused until the shareholders of Pioneer voted on the combination of our companies, which they approved on February 7. Post close, we expect buybacks to ramp up to a pace of $20 billion a year. Our ongoing success this quarter reflects the intense focus we have had for the past 7 years on improving every aspect of our business. We developed a strategy tied more directly to our core competitive advantages. We reorganized the company to create a group of centralized organizations that fully utilize the significant synergies between our businesses. We set and met ambitious plans to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company. And we established a track record of excellence in execution that is second to none. All of this has been critical to laying the foundation for further success, both in the current plan period through 2027 and over a much longer growth horizon, which I will discuss in a few minutes. As covered in the corporate plan update in early December, we expect to generate an additional $12 billion in earnings potential from 2023 to 2027 on a constant price and margin basis. That represents a compounded annual earnings growth rate over the plan period of greater than 10%. The drivers of this additional value are clear. Higher volumes from advantaged assets, mix improvements from the shift to higher-value products and further structural cost reductions. Within Product Solutions, for example, we expect to start up multiple strategic projects between now and the end of 2025, which will drive significant earnings growth through mix improvements. Consider our Singapore Resid Upgrade Project where our industry first technology application will allow us to transform bottom-of-the-barrel molecules into higher value base stocks significantly lifting margins. Our focus on shareholder value extends beyond the work we're doing to drive profitable growth.  We're also working hard to ensure that the value we've created is not diminished through third-party actions. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few that occurred in the quarter that attracted some media attention. In Guyana, as the operator of the world's premier deepwater development, we have created tremendous value. We believe the proposed Chevron-Hess transaction and ignoring preemption rights triggered by a change of control, diminishes an element of value due ExxonMobil.  We believe it's critical to defend these rights and fully preserve the value we've created. The arbitration we filed in the quarter seeks to confirm our rights and establish the value of the transaction places on the Guyana asset. This will allow us to fully evaluate options to maximize the value to ExxonMobil and our shareholders. Any responsible management team would do the same.  In the quarter, we also initiated litigation against 2 special interest activists masquerading as investors. These activists borrowed or group funded a nominal amount of shares to resubmit a proposal that in previous years had little shareholder support, which is a violation of the SEC's rules. These activists have publicly admitted they are working to stop production of oil and natural gas and have no interest in earning a financial return.  They hijack an important process that gives small shareholders a voice and are undermining the integrity of the system with an agenda that is not in the best interest of our investors or society, which is why we are actively opposing their efforts. Finally, although it attracted less attention, we successfully defended the Pioneer merger against a frivolous lawsuit designed to extract value from ExxonMobil shareholders.  A plaintiff's lawyer who sued to block the deal has repeatedly abused a legitimate legal process to extort money from companies to have his lawsuit withdrawn. We refused to pay this \"merger tax\". The court ruled in our favor, finding that filing a lawsuit solely to gain leverage in the settlement negotiation is an improper purpose. Even more important, the court sanctioned the lawyer for operating in bad faith in order him to pay ExxonMobil's legal fees, which will hopefully discourage similar frivolous lawsuits in the future. While results of these efforts may not show up in any discrete quarterly result, they underpin long-term value and demonstrate our strong commitment to doing what's right.  Turning to another area of strong commitment that shows up every quarter, is our focus on functional excellence, a core competitive advantage and a key pillar of our strategy. In Guyana, it's delivering unprecedented success and value creation, reflected in the startup of the Prosperity FPSO last November, ahead of schedule and below cost. As with our 2 previous developments, this cost and schedule performance was industry-leading. The excellence in execution demonstrated in delivering a project continued into its operation. With Prosperity, we reached nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels a day in January, just 2 months after startup and well ahead of the industry average of 15 months. Once our projects are up and running, we continually look for debottlenecking opportunities to increase production. All 3 FPSOs are now producing above their funding basis, helping to drive record gross production in the first quarter, all with an emissions intensity amongst the lowest in our upstream portfolio.  Looking ahead, we're pleased that our sixth project, Whiptail, has now reached FID with a planned start-up by year-end 2027. It's remarkable to think that within 8 years of first oil, Guyana will have a production capacity of more than 1.3 million barrels per day. Our work in Guyana is delivering tangible benefits for the Guyanese people. The development of Guyana's energy economy drove the highest real GDP growth in the world in 2022. The oil and gas industry is directly supporting thousands of local suppliers and Guyanese workers.  And our gas-to-energy project will feed a new government-owned power plant with the potential to significantly increase reliability and reduce both the cost of electricity and its greenhouse gas emissions. As I said at CERAWeek last month, I believe Guyana will go down as one of the most successful deep water developments in the history of the industry. The final point I'd like to make about our upstream business this morning involves our Canada operations. With the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion scheduled to come online May 1, our production from Kearl will have better access to markets in Asia and the U.S. West Coast, which we expect will improve margins and drive higher earnings in future quarters. Product Solutions also demonstrated excellence in execution this quarter. Overall, we generated record first quarter refining throughput during a period of peak turnaround activity. Thanks to the outstanding work of our team, we maintained strong turnaround cost and schedule performance. The structural improvements made in turnarounds would not have been possible with our decision to create centralized organizations that are now critical elements of our success. We've been able to take our best thinking and experience from across the corporation and apply it to some of our biggest challenges like these very large maintenance events.  We've eliminated silos, consolidated expertise and narrowed our focus to the challenges and opportunities with the highest value. Our turnaround performance is translating to both structural cost savings and higher throughput, helping us capture more value from the market than peers, especially at a time of historically high refining margins. Finally, our commitment to execution excellence is delivering significant improvements in our environmental performance. Our methane emissions intensity is down more than 60% since 2016. One of the many steps we took included replacing all 6,000-plus natural gas-driven pneumatic devices in our Permian unconventional operated assets. Disciplined execution is critical to success when markets are weak and margins are low. It pays even bigger dividends when the market environment is constructive as it was in the first quarter for crude and refining. Crude prices remained roughly flat near the middle of the 10-year range. More recently, the market for crude has tightened with ongoing concerns about the Middle East, putting a floor into prices, which are up more than 10% year-to-date. Natural gas prices move back inside the 10-year range on high inventory and lower demand. Refining margins rose back to the top of the 10-year range as demand grew while industry downtime and global disruptions weighed on supply. Chemical margins were relatively flat as demand growth is being met with new capacity. While short-term market conditions are an important context for quarterly results, it's how we position ourselves to leverage the long-term fundamentals that drive sustained shareholder value. I'd like to turn to this for a moment now and plan to spend more time over the year reminding everyone of our attractive growth opportunities that extend well beyond this year and our planned period.  I know there's a view that we're in a declining industry. That view is wrong. People don't fully appreciate the scale of the global energy system. It took many tens of trillions of dollars to build and today takes more than $2 trillion a year to sustain. This doesn't mean we shouldn't address the emissions challenge. In fact, the world needs to do more in a far more serious way to meet society's emission reduction ambitions. But it also means that oil and natural gas will play a much greater role than the market thinks.  By 2050, the world is expected to add nearly 2 billion people and the size of the global economy is expected to double from roughly $90 trillion to $180 trillion. Scenarios like IEA Net Zero to see oil demand falling from more than 100 million barrels per day now to 25 million barrels per day in 2050, are not realistic. Even if demand for transportation fuels declined significantly with greater penetration of electric vehicles, the market for petrochemicals is expected to double.  While the transition to a lower emissions future will be long, there's no denying, it's happening. The question is, who will capture the value. We believe the same competitive advantages that have underpinned ExxonMobil's success for more than 100 years, will serve as the foundation for building a range of world-class businesses in a lower emissions world. As I've said many times, we're a technology company at our core. We transform molecules at scale to meet society's needs. The notion that the world can electrify everything is misguided. Molecules will play a dominant role in the energy, materials and products the world needs in 2050 and beyond. At our low carbon solutions spotlight last year, we'll walk you through the opportunity we saw in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. Since that time, we've also entered the market for lithium. The total addressable market in these areas going forward is potentially in the trillions of dollars.  Today, I'd like to mention some of the additional areas we're exploring that have tremendous potential. We discussed each of these opportunities in detail with our Board of Directors during a visit to our Baytown complex in March. The world has become increasingly focused on the challenge of mismanaged plastic waste. The solution requires a sound policy, responsible manufacturing, expanded waste management infrastructure and new technologies like those that underpin our advanced recycling projects.  We have 12 projects in our plants to help us meet the growing demand for processing plastic waste. Our first project at Baytown is one of the largest in North America, with the ability to process 80 million pounds per year of plastic waste that would otherwise end up in a landfill. By breaking down plastic waste into its constituent molecules, our technology significantly widens the range of plastics that can be processed, including hard recycled materials such as potato chip bags and astro turf. We are planning to develop more than 1 billion pounds per year of plastic waste processing capacity by 2027. Another growth area is Proxima, which was showcased at our Product Solutions spotlight last September. With Proxima, we transform lower-value gasoline molecules into a high-performance, high-value resin with numerous commercial applications. In short, Proxima is a new chemistry for an enduring challenge, making materials that are lighter, stronger and more durable with lower GHD emissions.  Proxima is up to 4x stronger than steel and 7x lighter, making an excellent replacement for rebar. As a protective coating, it takes one application in 5 minutes to cure versus 2 to 3 applications with 8 hours in between. It has multiple light weighting applications in the automotive sector, and it has half the life cycle emissions of traditional thermoset resin systems. For us, Proxima is an advantaged fuels to Performance Chemicals business that we plan to scale and build into a global brand.  We see an addressable market of up to 5 million tonnes per year, growing faster than GDP, with earnings potential of $1 billion a year by 2040 and returns above 15%.  We are also exploring opportunities materials made from carbon which, as the world decarbonizes, will become an increasingly advantaged feedstock. We launched a technology venture about 2 years ago to assess attractive new markets for carbon products. We see opportunities to transform the molecular structure of low-value carbon-rich feeds from refining and petrochemical processes to create high-value products for growing markets. Some of these markets include carbon fiber, polymer additives, battery materials and electrodes for steel production. We are specifically focused on high-value segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates more than double GDP.  One potential opportunity is the carbon materials used in batteries and energy storage solutions. With demand for this segment growing above 10% per year, these carbon materials are expected to be in short supply. Additionally, as the needs for storage solutions evolve, there will be an increasing demand for higher-performance carbon materials. The carbon-rich feedstock available in ExxonMobil's existing businesses coupled with our core technology capabilities and complementary lithium offering positions us to meet the growing demand and deliver product performance improvements required for the battery and energy storage solutions of the future.  The last technology I'll touch on today is Direct Air Capture or DAC. For the world to reach Net Zero, negative emissions technologies are going to be needed, none holds greater long-term promise than DAC. The challenges, however, are as big as the opportunity. Atmospheric CO2 is extremely diluted at about 425 parts per million, a massive amount of air has to be processed to remove a single ton of carbon dioxide.  Today, many technologies are competing to crack the code and make DAC scalable and affordable. Our scientists and engineers are hard at work on this problem. We've launched a pilot project at Baytown that has demonstrated feasibility with the use of a proprietary capture process. Our initial goal is to cut the cost in half, which will still be too expensive, but will help move us down the cost curve. The current market for DAC is tiny, at less than 10,000 tons per year of CO2 captured, but the long-term potential is huge.  We are excited that dozens of companies and universities are chasing direct air capture solutions. We wish them all success irrespective of where the breakthrough occurs or who achieves it. ExxonMobil will have an important role to play.  As we've demonstrated, there are a few, if any, companies better positioned than us to globally deploy a molecule technology at scale with attractive returns. People who limit our future to the products and markets we are in today, have lost sight of our past and don't understand our core capabilities or advantages or the future potential they hold.  Consider our Baytown low carbon hydrogen project, which is entering advanced stages of engineering and development. We are not only focused on building the supply side of this new market for low carbon hydrogen, but are also making strong progress in building large-scale demand as demonstrated in our MOUs for offtake of low-carbon ammonia with SK of South Korea and JERA of Japan.  The last piece required to bring this project in market to life is government policy that maintains a level playing field across all methods of hydrogen production. Without this, we cannot and will not move forward. On the other hand, if incentives are developed to establish a viable technology neutral market, our advantages will allow us to generate attractive returns and invest more, accelerating customers' emissions reduction.  Over ExxonMobil's entire history and across the globe, we've built industries and value chains where none previously existed. We will continue to do this. In a fast transition, we'll grow earnings and cash flow with accelerated investments in CCS, hydrogen, biofuels and DAC. In a slow transition, we'll grow earnings and cash flow through advantaged investments in our traditional businesses. In irrespective of the transition pace, we'll extend our reach to new high-value markets with innovative new products. Under any scenario, we are convinced that our company is uniquely positioned to play a leading role, meeting the world's essential needs for energy and high-value materials and products.  With that, I'll hand it over to Kathy. Kathryn Mikells : Thanks, Darren. We've established a consistent track record of improving the earnings power of our business. Across the company, our teams have been laser-focused on investing in competitively advantaged, low cost of supply, high-return opportunities delivering execution excellence in everything we do and driving additional structural cost improvements.  Our earnings growth over the past 4 years was more than twice the pace of our closest peer. As of year-end 2023, we more than doubled earnings, bringing an incremental $14 billion to our bottom line on a constant price and margin basis versus 2019. As Darren noted, over the next 4 years, we plan to increase earnings potential by an additional $12 billion or a CAGR of more than 10%.  Our ability to deliver industry-leading earnings growth reflects our unique competitive advantages, consistent strategy and the differentiated execution capabilities our people bring every single day. We've demonstrated our ability to improve the profitability of the business by reshaping our portfolio, divesting noncore assets, investing in accretive high profit opportunities and driving structural cost savings.  This quarter, we've included a few additional slides to remind you of the plans we discussed during the corporate plan update last December and to demonstrate the progress we've been making. Going forward, we'll provide you with regular updates on these metrics.  The drivers of our expected earnings growth are clear. Additional structural cost savings reductions of over $5 billion versus year-end 2023, higher volumes and more profitable barrels from advantaged assets like Guyana and the Permian in the upstream and execution of strategic projects and product solutions that enhance our product mix driving exceptional growth in high-value products. As I said during the corporate plan update in December last year, to win in our business, we must be a low-cost operator. That means continually finding ways to become even more efficient. With more than $10 billion in structural cost improvements as of the first quarter of 2024, split roughly 50-50 between upstream and product solutions, we're making steady progress towards the incremental $5 billion we're working to deliver by 2027.  And we are on track to further extend that industry-leading performance. These structural cost savings have not only mitigated the impact of inflation, but have helped to offset the cost of new projects. Our success is meaningfully improving our operating cost and driving higher earnings for both upstream and product solutions.  In fact, we ended last year with our cash operating expenses, excluding energy cost and production taxes down $4.5 billion versus 2019. We have a clear line of sight to achieve the roughly $1.5 billion in annual savings contained in our plan, and our team has a track record of beating our targets.  We're leveraging our global organizations, including our Global Operations and Sustainability Group and the global business solutions and global supply chain organizations that we stood up last year. These organizations are tasked with realizing savings across all of our businesses. We're optimizing our turnarounds and other scheduled maintenance activities. We're streamlining and automating our order to cash, procure to pay, record to report and our planning processes.  And we're better leveraging the scale of our supply chain to improve the efficiency of our logistics movements, enhance our buying power and lower the level of materials and inventory that we need to run our operations. We have a proven track record and a high level of confidence in our plan, and more importantly, in our team's ability to deliver.  In the Upstream, on a stand-alone basis, we're on track to double earnings potential by 2027 compared to 2019 on a constant price basis, as we reshape our portfolio, divesting noncore assets and growing production from industry-leading assets that offer lower cost of supply, lower life cycle emissions and higher returns. Between 2019 and 2023, we've pruned Upstream's portfolio of nonstrategic assets, including U.S. flowing gas and focused on developing advantaged assets such as Guyana, the Permian, LNG and Brazil.  For example, since 2019, we've more than doubled production volume in the Permian. In Guyana, we started 2019 with 0 production volumes. This quarter, we delivered more than 600 kbd of gross production. These efforts have resulted in a significant Upstream mix improvement. Our share of total production from advantaged assets has risen from 28% to 44%. We expect to grow Upstream earnings by an additional 50% between 2023 and 2027. That growth is driven by further production mix improvement, incremental cost savings and production growth.  We expect our stand-alone production in 2024 to be about 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, rising to about 4.2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2027, as growth from advantaged assets more than offset base depletion. Since 2019, we've nearly doubled Upstream unit profitability at constant price from $5 per oil-equivalent barrel to $9 as of the first quarter of 2024. We expect unit profitability to increase to $13 per oil-equivalent barrel by 2027. Unit earnings from our advantaged assets are expected to be $9 per barrel higher than our base portfolio by 2027 at constant prices.  Moving to Product Solutions. We're focused on nearly tripling earnings from 2019 to 2027. We're well on our way to achieving that, having more than doubled earnings potential at the halfway mark at the end of last year. As an Upstream, a key driver of our earnings growth is improving our mix. The strategic projects we're executing do just that. Projects like the China Chemical Complex and the renewable diesel project in Strathcona will increase our high-value product volumes, which command a 10% to 25% margin premium. Projects such as our Singapore Resid Upgrade will also improve our mix without increasing overall volumes by converting low-margin products like fuel oil to higher-margin products like base stocks, diesel and chemical feed. This, in addition to structural cost savings, is the key to further growing our earnings.  We have a clear line of sight on the nearly $5 billion in earnings from strategic projects in 2027. Through 2023, we delivered nearly 1/3 of our goal. In 2024, we'll see a full year of earnings benefit from the Beaumont refinery expansion and Permian Crude Venture. On the chart, you can see the annualized first quarter contributions from these and other projects that we brought online since 2019. As we highlighted on our earnings call last quarter, 2025 is a big year for strategic project start-ups, which will provide a further large boost in earnings growth. Given the track record of our global projects and centralized technology organizations, we're confident in our ability to execute this plan, which delivers the capacity needed to double high-value product sales. By 2027, we expect high-value products to deliver about 40% of Product Solutions total earnings.  Turning to the quarter, I'll start with a high-level review of sequential earnings. Details by business segments are available in the backup to this presentation. I'm then going to spend a bit of time discussing our earnings year-on-year, which I think better highlights the progress that we're making in the key areas that drive our underlying earnings growth over the medium term. You'll see that we're providing more detail on what impacts our volumes and costs period-to-period to more clearly link our current performance to the earnings growth drivers that I discussed earlier. We provided definitions of these factors and the backup to this presentation.  First quarter GAAP earnings were $8.2 billion, excluding identified items, earnings were down $1.8 billion sequentially. Timing effects were $1 billion unfavorable impact this quarter, mostly related to unsettled derivatives mark-to-market impacts consistent with this quarter's increase in oil prices. Other items, largely noncash, were $600 million or $0.15 per share hurt this quarter, driven mainly by noncash impacts from tax and inventory balance sheet adjustments.  Base volumes were lower in the quarter as entitlement impacts fewer days in the quarter and the impact of higher scheduled maintenance were partially offset by growth from advantaged assets and strategic projects. Looking at the first quarter performance versus the same quarter last year, you can clearly see the contributions from growing advantaged assets and executing our strategic projects as well as our underlying structural cost improvements.  GAAP earnings of $8.2 billion were down more than $3 billion versus our record first quarter earnings reported last year. The decline was driven by lower industry gas prices and refining and chemical margins, as well as higher maintenance and negative timing impacts from higher oil prices and the noncash expenses that I mentioned earlier. We made good progress continuing to improve the underlying earnings power of the business. We saw a strong growth from our advantaged assets like Guyana and projects like the Beaumont refinery expansion, which roughly offset lower base volumes that reflect divestments, entitlements and curtailments in the Upstream and divestments and higher maintenance in energy products. We added $400 million of structural cost savings this quarter, which resulted in an after-tax earnings benefit of $300 million.  Now let's turn to the segments to dive further into our performance. In the Upstream, lower gas realizations were partly offset by slightly higher liquid realizations. As Darren mentioned, oil and natural gas prices in the quarter were about at the middle of the 10-year range. Our excellence in execution is delivering results. Higher volumes from advantaged assets more than offset divestment, curtailment and entitlement impacts, contributing $430 million in earnings versus the first quarter last year.  In Guyana, we delivered 3 development projects, bringing online over 600 kbd of gross oil production since initial discovery at an industry-leading pace and cost. This quarter, gross production for Payara ramped up to 220 Kbd design capacity well ahead of schedule. We've also announced a new exploration discovery, Bluefin. Earnings also benefited from about $90 million in additional structural cost savings, driven by operational efficiency gains and reduced expenses from divested assets.  Our Kearl operation in Canada is a great example of how we're reducing production costs. Last year, we converted our entire fleet of about 80 heavy haul trucks to a fully autonomous operation. The automation program enables us to capture improvements in truck productivity, further enhance safety of our operations and structurally reduce our operating costs. With this program, Kearl now operates the largest autonomous fleet in our industry and one of the largest autonomous mining fleets in the world. And we continue to look at other opportunities to expand automation across our production footprint.  Kearl's gross production in the first quarter was 277 Kbd, which was a record for a first quarter. 2023 average gross production of 270 Kbd was also a record annual production. Higher expenses of $160 million were driven by an increase in depreciation rates in U.S. unconventional, while other, which is largely noncash, reflects the absence of favorable tax and divestment adjustments last year and inventory adjustments this quarter.  Timing effects in the Upstream had a negative $120 million impact on the quarter, compared to a negative $490 million impact last year, driven by our mark-to-market position on our derivatives portfolio.  In Product Solutions, we're high-grading our portfolio by divesting nonstrategic sites and investing where we have competitive advantages. Energy Products delivered roughly $1.4 billion in earnings in the quarter. Our advantaged configuration and commercial logistics capabilities enabled a dynamic response to the changing macro environment, which saw industry margins decline versus last year, primarily due to additional supply and normalizing trade flows. The strategic projects we executed last year, expanding our Beaumont refinery and completing the Permian Crude pipeline, helped us achieve record first quarter refining throughput and contributed to the $140 million earnings improvement. High-grading our portfolio also means making some tough but necessary choices to improve long-term competitiveness. Divestments in the middle of last year impacted volumes, but also contributed to structural cost savings in the period.  We recently announced additional rationalizations in France and Germany to further strengthen our portfolio. As Darren mentioned, we saw a high level of turnaround activity in the quarter, which is reflected in expenses. We're really proud of our team who delivered best ever execution of our recent slate of turnarounds. As expected in a rising price environment, we saw negative timing effects which are primarily related to the mark-to-market on unsettled derivatives. Last year, the timing impact was favorable as prices were falling at that time. These impacts unwind over time.  Chemical products earned nearly $800 million this quarter, more than double the result from the prior year period. While global polyethylene and polypropylene margins decreased, we drove a sizable margin increase largely due to our advantaged footprint but also due to increased contributions from Performance Products. Higher earnings from high-value product volumes reflect the many investments we've made over the years.  Gulf Coast growth ventures in Corpus Christi, North American polypropylene and Baton Rouge and our Baytown Chemical expansion, all contribute to this growth. Base volumes increased on the absence of prior period turnarounds, but also on strong reliability in the U.S. Gulf Coast that enabled additional sales when others in the region were negatively impacted by winter storms in January. Specialty Products continued to deliver consistently strong earnings coming in at $760 million this quarter. Our efforts to grow margins through feed optimization and revenue management were evident this quarter and largely made possible by the differentiated performance of our high-value products. We had a strong contribution from the finished lubricants business, which is celebrating the 50-year anniversary of Mobil 1, our flagship brand.  Our rigorous focus on structural cost reductions partially offset higher base expenses. The improved earnings power in our businesses translates to strong cash flow and our consistent capital allocation philosophy enables exceptional long-term shareholder returns. We generated $14.7 billion in cash flow from operations and $10.1 billion of free cash flow during the first quarter, and we continue to deploy that capital, consistent with our allocation priorities.  First and foremost, our CapEx deployment supports investments in competitively advantaged opportunities that drive long-term earnings and cash flow growth. To sustain growth, we need to be investing now in low cost of supply, high-return, resilient projects. We're doing just that with multiple project startups planned for 2025 and that will contribute nearly $4 billion in earnings potential in 2027 at constant prices and margins. Our cash CapEx for the quarter came in at $5.3 billion. Secondly, to stay on the offensive through the commodity cycles, we need to maintain a bulletproof balance sheet. During the first quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of bond maturities, bringing our debt-to-capital down to 16% and our net debt-to-capital ratio down to 3%. This outstanding balance sheet strength gives us ample optionality to capitalize on attractive opportunities regardless of where the market moves.  And finally, strong operational results coupled with a healthy balance sheet, not only provide flexibility to invest through the cycles, but also to consistently return excess cash to our shareholders. We distributed $6.8 billion in the first quarter, including $3.8 billion in dividends. And while we briefly paused share repurchases following the Pioneer S-4 filing in January, we resumed in February and are on track to complete our $17.5 billion stand-alone share repurchase program this year. As a reminder, we intend to increase the pace of the program to $20 billion per year after the Pioneer transaction closes, assuming reasonable market conditions. These distributions matter. They help to drive our industry-leading total shareholder return and over a longer period of time, significantly reduce our share count.  Since we began the program in 2022, we reduced our share count by about 7% and or 8% excluding the shares issued for the Denbury acquisition. Looking ahead, our team's execution excellence, our stellar balance sheet and our extended reach to new high-value, high-growth markets uniquely positions us to grow long-term value.  Turning to the second quarter outlook items. We expect seasonal scheduled maintenance to lower upstream volumes by about 40 KOEBD. This does not impact our 2024 full year production guidance, which is 3.8 million oil-equivalent barrels a day. This guidance excludes Pioneer, which we still anticipate will close in the second quarter. In Product Solutions, we expect lower scheduled maintenance as we exit the peak of the 2024 turnaround season. We expect corporate and financing expenses to total $300 million to $500 million, in line with the first quarter. We also anticipate an unfavorable working capital impact of about $3 billion from seasonal cash tax payments, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of last year.  With that, let me go ahead and turn it back to Darren. Darren Woods : Thanks, Kathy. I'll leave you with a few key takeaways. Our work to improve the fundamental earnings power of ExxonMobil is continuing a pace. By executing with excellence on our strategy, we expect to grow our earnings potential by an additional $12 billion from 2023 to 2027 at constant prices and margins, a growth rate of more than 10% per year. A significant driver of this earnings growth will be our delivery of additional structural cost savings totaling $15 billion by 2027.  In the quarter, we continue to deliver unprecedented success in Guyana, with growing production creating additional value for our shareholders and the Guyanese people. Our strategic projects, which are another important driver of our planned earnings improvement, helped deliver record first quarter refining throughput and strong Performance Chemicals volume growth. And there are more projects planned for start-up in 2025. All of this is without the contribution of Pioneer.  With Pioneer, we'll be positioned to drive earnings, cash flow and shareholder distributions even higher. We continue to work constructively with the FTC as they conduct a very thorough review and remain confident that no competition issues should hinder the transaction. We've been working diligently on our integration plans, and we're ready to begin executing day 1 on the significant synergies this combination will create.  Looking beyond our plan period and into the future, we see attractive large-scale opportunities to leverage our core capabilities in our existing businesses and in brand-new markets with brand-new products, something our competitors can't do.  The success of this company and our unique set of competitive advantages is built on our greatest strength and most important advantage, great people. They are the best team in the business. Able to successfully overcome any challenge. Through their work at ExxonMobil, they are making a positive difference in the world, meeting people's essential needs for energy and products today and far into the future. I'm extremely proud to represent them and cannot thank them enough.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to this ExxonMobil Corporation Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mrs. Jennifer Driscoll. Please go ahead ma'am. Jim Chapman : Good morning everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. We appreciate you joining us. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investor section of our website. They are meant to accompany the second quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussions of our long-term plans and integration efforts, which are still being developed and which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the website. And now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks. Darren Woods : Good morning and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's performance remains strong. In the second quarter we delivered earnings of $9.2 billion, our second best second quarter results in the last 10 years. Just as important, we continue to improve the fundamental earnings power of the company, as Kathy covers in her prepared remarks available on our website. Our overall market conditions were softer in the second quarter. Oil prices remained firm. As a reminder, at Brent between $60 and $80 a barrel real and 10-year average refinery and chemical margins, we expect to generate between $80 billion and $140 billion in cumulative surplus cash from 2024 to 2027. The Pioneer acquisition increases that even further. In the quarter, we once again set production records from our advantage assets in Guyana and the Permian. Including Pioneer, our Permian production surged to 1.2 million barrels per day. In product solutions, our sales of high-return performance products rose 5% sequentially to a new record. Our strong performance in the quarter continues to support our capital allocation priorities, including the distribution of $9.5 billion to shareholders, of which $4.3 billion was in dividends. With the close of the Pioneer transaction, our shareholders now include the former owners of Pioneer stock who have begun to benefit from the strength of our combined companies. We welcome them to ExxonMobil, just as we do the talented people of Pioneer who bring a strong entrepreneurial mindset and deep expertise in unconventional resource development. I also want to recognize the combined transaction team for their excellence in execution. The average time to complete this type of merger over the last several years has been more than 11 months. We closed Pioneer in six months, once again demonstrating the strength of our organization and effectively executing large, complicated projects, including large acquisitions. It is challenging work, requiring deep thinking, a highly structured approach, and disciplined action, areas where we excel. Although, it's still early days, the integration is exceeding our expectations, and I'm confident we'll deliver even more synergies than we've announced. The team looks forward to sharing these details and all the other work we're doing to significantly grow value at our corporate plan update and Upstream spotlight in December. As we look ahead, we see opportunities to grow value not only through our corporate plan period, but long into the future. Later this month, we'll publish our global outlook, which projects global energy demand 15% higher in 2050 than it is today. We see oil demand holding steady at around 100 million barrels per day in 2050, while demand for renewables and natural gas grows considerably. An energy abundant future, driven by economic growth and rising levels of prosperity, creates opportunity for ExxonMobil, no matter the speed or direction of the energy transition. Over time, as it becomes more and more obvious that heavy industry and commercial transportation will not be meaningfully powered by renewables, the world will come to rely more on technologies where we have an advantage, including hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. A serious approach to the transition should focus on moving the world from high carbon to low carbon energy, not simply from oil and gas to wind and solar. The data, science, and economics all support this as fundamentally necessary. Our strategy reflects this reality and since it relies on the same corporate capabilities and advantages under any scenario, it is extremely flexible, delivering strong profitability irrespective of the path society takes. As a technology company that transforms molecules to meet society's needs, we're not defined by our existing product suite. We began as a maker of kerosene for lamps. Today, No one thinks of ExxonMobil as a kerosene company serving the lamp industry. In the future, ExxonMobil will be defined by the technologies and products it is producing to meet the world's future needs. As always, by drawing on our unique combination of competitive advantages. We shared with you a variety of technologies and products we're developing to more effectively meet existing needs, while helping the world achieve a lower carbon future. Two examples where I see significant new market potential are Proxxima and carbon materials. With Proxxima, we transform lower value gasoline molecules into a high performance, high value thermoset resin that can be used in coatings, lightweight construction materials, and advanced composites for cars and trucks, including battery boxes for electric vehicles. Materials made with Proxxima are lighter, stronger, more durable, and produced with significantly fewer GHG emissions than traditional alternatives. In March, we showcased the automotive uses of Proxxima at the world's leading international composites exhibition in Paris. We're progressing projects in Texas with startups planned in 2025 that will significantly expand the production of Proxxima. We see the total addressable market for Proxxima at 5 million tons and $30 billion by 2030, with demand growing faster than GDP and returns above 15%. That's an exciting new business opportunity with significant profit potential, for we have unique and hard to replicate advantages consistent with our strategy and core capabilities. We also see a sizable opportunity in carbon materials, transforming the molecular structure of low-value, carbon-rich feeds from our refining processes into high-value products for a range of applications. We are targeting market segments with margins of several thousand dollars per ton and growth rates outpacing GDP. These include carbon fiber, polymer additives, and battery materials. Our competitive advantages of scale, technology, and integration, combined with our North American manufacturing footprint, provides a foundation for building these compelling new high-margin businesses. I've challenged the product solutions team to lean into those opportunities and develop plans to accelerate the growth of both of these profitable new businesses. I hope we can ramp up investments to make them a meaningful part of our overall portfolio sooner, which will help further diversify earnings and significantly grow shareholder value for decades to come. ExxonMobil has a long history of successfully establishing new high-value and used products for established and growing markets. Consider Vistamaxx, which we launched to enhance the performance of everything from auto parts and construction materials to personal care products and packaging. We've grown our Vistamaxx performance polymer from five grades to 20, and total annual production capacity is 700,000 metric tons per annum, with highly attractive returns and significantly more growth potential. Of course, consistent with the track record we've established over the last seven years, the hurdle for investing will be high. Any investment will have to generate competitive returns, possess clear competitive advantages, and be resilient to the bottom of any commodity cycle. As we've demonstrated, our capital allocation decisions have generated robust earnings, cash flow, and shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing more about our growth opportunities in December. In closing, we have a lot to feel good about. Our performance is strong. Our merger with Pioneer is already creating tremendous value with more to come. And we continue to develop products and build businesses that will enable us to grow properly far into the future across a wide range of scenarios, including a rapid energy transition. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Jim Chapman : Thank you, Darren. Now, let's move to our Q&A session. As a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that, operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for our first question. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Neil Mehta, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning, Darren and team, and thanks for the update. I wanted to build on your comments on Pioneer. Now that it is under your umbrella. Can you build on some of your comments around, one how is the asset performing from a volume and type curve perspective relative to expectations, and two you alluded to synergies tracking ahead of expectations. Can you help delineate what those buckets of out performance are? Darren Woods : Yeah, good morning Neil. I'll start with a few comments and then let Kathy kind of add on top of that. I\u2019d say, early days yet two months in, but the work of the team prior to the change in control and then what we've seen since then is extremely encouraging. As we've stated, the Pioneer assets basically delivered a record performance in the second quarter. And if you think about the context of doing that with all the change that was going on with respect to the merger, I think a real testament to the quality of the people there and the work that they've been doing. So I'd say vectors are all pointing up. I think probably better than what we had anticipated, but I would also say it's early in the process. The teams today are working very well together, which has led to frankly, identifying a lot more value opportunities than frankly, I think either of us could see when we were on opposite sides of the fence. And now that we're together working, we see essentially a lot of opportunities to transfer the best practices of ExxonMobil into Pioneer and likewise to transfer a number of best practices from Pioneer into the ExxonMobil Base, which when you think about our size has some tremendous leverage associated with it. So that's all being worked through in detail. As you know, when we commit to some of our objectives, they're based by some very detailed plans that sit behind them. The organization today is working those plans, but we already see significant upside potential, not only in the magnitude, but in the pace at which we'll be able to deliver them. So I think a really positive story there. I'll let Kathy maybe add some additional details. Kathy? Kathy Mikells : Sure, I think one of the things we've been really pleased by is the number of learnings that we've already had from Pioneer. And so not only will we bring our technology and cube development to them, but they are bringing a bunch of learnings to us. So we're already utilizing their remote logistics operations center in our own drilling and completions operations in order to improve supply chain. They've done some things on the procurement side, I'd say, that we think can help us to kind of leverage up our expertise. They've been really good over the years of locking up their acreage. So we think that's another thing that ultimately we can benefit from. And then as I think everyone knows, they've got a quite large water infrastructure in the Midland Basin. And we'll be looking to also leverage that. So we've been really pleased with what they bring to the table and we're off to a really good start, as we look at building an integration development plan with them that fully utilizes the technology that we bring to the table. And so we're going to have a corporate plan update in December. We are going to do a spotlight on the Upstream, and we'll update where we're at with the synergies and how we are looking forward at that time. Darren Woods : Yeah, I guess cap it off, Neil, with we said at the time we announced the acquisition that we were going to produce more barrels at a lower cost and in a more environmentally friendly way. That continues to be the case. That's obviously good for our company, but more importantly, as we said at the time, we continue to emphasize it's good for the US, it is good for the US economy, it's good for the people living in the US, it's good for US businesses and critically it's good for US energy security. So I think this is as I said at the time, going to be a win-win proposition for all. Neil Mehta : All right. Thank you, Darren. Thank you, Kathy. Operator : The next question is from Betty Jiang with Barclays. Betty Jiang : Darren, Kathy, good morning. Since I just talked about Permian, we'll hit on the other region that's also hitting record production, so Guyana volumes continue to exceed expectations and the FPSO just continue to produce while above capacity. We'd love to just get an understanding of, do you think this type of performance is likely to continue and is that translatable for what you would expect for the future projects that's yet to come. Darren Woods : Sure, I'll take that Betty. Thank you and good morning. Good to hear from you again. I would say, you know, what you're seeing is the collective effort of our organization focusing on what is a very high value development and making sure that we are taking advantage of all the opportunities we can find to safely grow production. And as you commented, we are seeing some significant improvements with production rates well above what we had based the investment decision on and that's continuing across all three of them. We try to take that into account as we develop the next and so in theory, you would think we build that into the base and don't continue to see that. But frankly our experience is telling us otherwise, which is this organization, complemented by the work that we're doing with our technology organization, our global operations and sustainability organization, every element of the organization that we have now created and functionalized is very focused on maximizing values. And so, with these new organizations and that focus, they continue to find additional opportunities. So, I would bet that we'll continue to see how performance versus the basis on which we FID, but I would also tell you that every development is unique unto itself and obviously we got to get it up and running and then let the teams get after it and find the opportunities to safely increase its capacity. But I would just tell you, I would bet on our people to find that. We've got a long history of doing it, and it's clearly demonstrating itself with this unique and valuable opportunity here. Betty Jiang : Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet, thank you Betty. Operator : The next question comes from Doug Leggate with Wolfe Research. Doug Leggate : Hey, Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning Darren and Kathy. Kathy Mikells : Good morning. Doug Leggate : I'm still getting used to the new moniker Darren, but thanks for having me on. So I wonder if I could ask a question about portfolio now that you've got Pioneer in the door. You've got a lot of things that are perhaps you could characterize as maybe non-core, a lot of tails in the portfolio. And I'm just curious, we haven't really heard much on the asset disposal front in a while, and I'm curious if now that you've got two very significant concentrated assets to some extent, the Permian and Guyana, what it means for the portfolio in terms of high-grading opportunities going forward? Darren Woods : Yeah, I'll start with that, and then I'll let Kathy add anything that she wants to. But I would say, actually, we've been fairly aggressively going after the tail. You remember, I think back in 2019, we had announced that we were going to divest about $15 billion over time. Of course, we got into the pandemic and we said we're not going to, this is not a forced-March. We're going to basically divest when the market conditions ensure that we can realize the value that we think the assets that we are marketing can be realized. And frankly, that's what we've been doing. So as you look at where we're at today, second quarter this year, I think we've basically gotten to the $15 billion in the Upstream. And then if you look at what we've been doing in the downstream, there's another few billion dollars that we've added on top of that. So frankly, from a cleaning up the tail standpoint, we've made significant progress. Obviously, there's a few more things that we're working on and we'll continue to assess every one of the assets in the portfolio, make sure that they are competitively advantaged. And, you know, frankly, as we look at new investments, we force those investments to compete on an industry-wide basis and make sure that they're advantaged versus the industry and therefore can be a supply product at low cost of supply. We also do that with all of our existing assets. And if they are not competitively positioned on an industry supply curve, then the organization has two options. Either we come up with an advantage investment that makes them more competitive and moves them to the left on the cost of supply curve, or we look to divest. And that process has been ongoing across all of our businesses. And then obviously the timing of when we then take action is a function of realizing the value that we think those divestments should bring. And we're patient. We're not going to rush that process. But I would just say staying after it, being very steady, waiting for the market to meet, to be where it needs to be in order for us to [reevaluate] (ph) it has paid off significantly. And basically, we're delivering on what we said we were going to do, and we'll continue to look at it. But I don't see any big step changes here in the medium-term. Kathy Mikells : And the only other thing I'd note, Neil, is you can see in our cash flow bridges every quarter. Doug Leggate : Doug. Kathy Mikells : Sorry. I'm sorry, Doug. I'm sorry. But you can see in our cash flow bridges, we're pretty consistently every quarter bringing in more proceeds from the divestments that are occurring. You know, in the first half of the year that was $1.6 billion. And then I would just note we had a lot of activity in Upstream. And so that generated some positive earnings for us in the quarter. And so if you look at my prepared remarks, you know, that we published earlier this morning, I talk about sort of $380 million in the Upstream being kind of these other one-off items. And that was a lot of earnings coming in from divestments only partially offset by the one-off cost associated with Pioneer. Doug Leggate : Terrific, it would have been worse if you'd called me Jennifer Kathy, but thanks so much. I appreciate it. Kathy Mikells : Yeah, good appreciate that. Sorry about that Doug. Jim Chapman : Doug, congratulations on the new shop, the new platform. Doug Leggate : And to you, Jim. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Darren, you had a lot of good updates in your prepared remarks on some of the low carbon initiatives. There's been a lot of progress there, it seems over the past few months and quarters, which is great to see. And I think back to the corporate plan you laid out late last year, this is a growing wedge of your overall capital spending in each of the next few years. So I was wondering for some of these investment opportunities, and more about what miles you're focused on to actually start allocate more capital to these areas. So what's needed to make final investment decision on [ExxonMobil] (ph) [indiscernible] or move forward with carbon materials or build the scale you talked about in lithium production. Is it more commercialization in offtake, technology development, regulatory clarity, something else? Darren Woods : Sure. Yes. You broke up just a little bit on that, Devin, but I think I got to gist of your question. If I don't hit the mark then please steer me in a slightly different direction. I think your question around what's required to kind of continue to move along in our investments in the low carbon solution across the portfolio of products that we've been talking about. I would just say, fundamentally we expect in the low carbon businesses -- and in fact, some of these new products that while they contribute to a lower carbon future, they also bring significant value in use in today's application, they have to compete in the portfolio, they have to be advantaged versus what's out there today and they have to basically generate good returns across the commodity cycles. And so the fundamental philosophy that we've been applying in the base business also is required in these -- the new businesses that we are trying to generate. So that's foundational what each of -- and Dan Ammann, in particular but then the stuff that's coming out of the Product Solutions organization, has also got to meet that initial hurdle. And then as you look across each of them, the hurdles to clear to deliver on that expectation vary little bit. I would say in Dan's business with the carbon capture and storage, he and his team are building a brand-new business. And so there are very few, I think examples of where the company is not only developing the technology and the infrastructure and logistics system, but also developing the capacity to supply, while developing the demand and developing the market in general, and advocating on, what I\u2019d say, are the initial policies needed to get things kick started. So there are a lot of moving parts. I would say the broader industry and business community, frankly haven't gotten far enough along this to truly appreciate just how complicated it is. But I\u2019d say leveraging the capacity and capability that we've built over the decades doing this in other parts of our company, particularly in the Upstream, that we are leveraging those capabilities and making really good progress there. On the blue hydrogen project, as we've worked through the engineering -- and we've got a really good line of sight to what that project can deliver. Obviously, a critical element of that is getting the IRA legislation translated into final regulations, and that's a process that's been ongoing. We are optimistic that the regulations will reflect the intent of the legislation. And if it does, I think we'll have a very attractive project that we can then FID here once those regulations are finalized. So I am optimistic in that space. And as you may have seen, we've just added another 500,000 tons of carbon capture and storage into Dan's portfolio. And there is a pipeline that the team continues to work. So we see continued opportunity and growth with good returns in the carbon capture side of the equation. On the lithium same thing -- while lithium is an established market, it's fairly small with respect to what its ultimate potential is. And of course, we are bringing on a new production method with some new technology. And so again, doing the work to understand what the investments required there are and to establish and ensure that we've got a real advantage versus what else is out there and what else needs to come on to meet the growing demand in lithium. But again, I feel good about that. We've told the team, don't -- we're not looking to rush this through and get something, get money spent. We are looking to make sure that we build a very strong long-term foundation. So none of the work that we are doing in these new businesses is schedule-driven. It is all about establishing successful long-term foundations. And then maybe just briefly touch on Proxxima and the Carbon Ventures, which that's a broader effort that we've been on for quite some time, which is to say, leverage our technical capabilities to transform molecules and apply that to markets that exist with unmet needs. And I think we are making really good progress with Proxxima. We've got some, I think very high barriers to entry and competitive advantages there. And so I'm anxious to kind of prosecute that business and establish it as quickly as we can because we see real potential there. And same with Carbon Ventures, again leveraging our ability to transform the molecule, shape the molecules and get some structures that improve performance. I think there is a big opportunity there. So but that's \u2013 I\u2019d say Carbon Ventures is still early in the technology cycle, but I think we've gone far enough along to see some real opportunity there. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the challenge I've given the Product Solutions organization is what's a realistic but aggressive business plan look like and what would be the investment required to establish that. And that's good because it grows value today, but it also positions us well. As those molecules become less demanded in their traditional applications, it becomes a much lower feedstock to these new applications. And so there is a lot of opportunity to diversify the [slate] (ph) and protect the business or diversify the business, as we move through the transition. So long answer, but a lot of variables at play here, but frankly, all variables that we feel very comfortable managing. And I think the progress we're making there demonstrates our capability to manage those things. Devin McDermott : All right. Thanks Darren. I appreciate all the detail. Darren Woods : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Royall with JPMorgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning thanks for taking my question. So my question is on the CapEx guidance update. We see that you moved to the legacy CapEx up to the top end of the prior range. And then obviously, you layered in Pioneer as well. But can you talk about the drivers of the legacy CapEx bumping up to $25 billion for the year? Darren Woods : Yes. Good morning John. I'll start with that and then let Kathy finish up. But -- so the way -- the reason we put a range out on the CapEx, as we build these plans in the previous year, starting around this time in the summertime and then kind of lock and load them in October. And obviously, there is a lot of things that develop and evolve from the middle of the previous year to -- as go into this year. That range is not meant to have you guys slice it down the middle and fix on a number. The range is to say, we've got optionality here. And as things evolve, we may reduce some of the spending. Or if we find that the opportunities are panning out the way we expect, we may be on the other end. So that range is truly where we expect to be somewhere in -- and how things evolve and what the opportunity set looks like. I mean the key focus here is to make sure that we are investing in highly advantaged, highly profitable projects. And basically, as we worked our way from October of last year into this year, we see a lot of attractive opportunities that we continue to invest in which puts us at the top end of that, consistent with what we understood the opportunity set could look like, as we went into the plan process last year. That's why we are coming in at [2025] (ph). And then of course, we're using the Pioneer number to add on top of that. But Kathy, anything to add to that? Kathy Mikells : No, I would just say, obviously we have a lot of projects coming online in 2025 and the exact pace of all of those. And therefore, making sure that we provided sort of enough room, I would say, in the initial guidance supporting of all of those projects that are coming online in 2025. We can't pinpoint, predict all of that as we put our plans together for the year. And so just as an example, China 1 is a huge project. It is going to be coming online early next year as an example. So there is always a little bit of give and take, which is why we give the range to start with. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually wanted to follow up on the 2025 project startups that you just mentioned, and thanks for a little bit more detail on the China chemicals complex. But as I look to the other projects coming online, I think the largest earnings contributors, include the Permian crude pipeline and then in the Upstream, Golden Pass and then the next [Guyana boat] (ph). So I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on those projects in terms of how they're progressing and kind of phasing through the year? Thanks. Darren Woods : So I would say consistent with the plans that we put out, the projects are all with obviously the exception of Golden Pass, moving consistent with the planned development and the announced dates that we talked about. All of them, I think we feel really good about in terms of the work that we're doing. And the case for the contributions, the returns the earnings that we expect to get out of those projects, I think we continue to feel good about. Underpinning all the projects is we'd never try to take a position on where we're going to be in the market cycle, but instead make sure that these projects, when they come on, can compete in any of the areas of the cycle. And we've actually found that, if you look at the investments we've made since 2018 brought online, if you look at the aggregate return of that portfolio, it is exceeding the basis in which we FID-ed those projects. Even as we have been, say in the Chemical business at bottom-of-cycle conditions. So I think we continue to demonstrate to ourselves the time we spend to make sure these projects are advantaged in the best case is paying off. And then, of course our global project organization is really continuing to drive very effective execution of the portfolio with -- keeping our cost well within the FID basis and generally delivering it faster and therefore, bringing more value sooner. Kathy? Kathy Mikells : Yes. And I would just note and especially a big year for our [E&PS] (ph) business. So I already noted China 1. You noted a couple of projects. I mean, the Singapore resid upgrade project is a pretty big project. We have an upgrade project at Fawley in order to bring on ultra-low sulfur diesel. We've got the Strathcona project for renewable diesel coming online in 2025. So a really big year for the E&PS business in terms of the number of projects we have coming online. And then we're going to continue to expand our advanced recycling. So we'll be adding more capacity as well next year. So we noted, again if you look at our IR slides, we talk about projects being a big driver of underlying earnings growth in the E&PS business, and you see that supported by everything coming on in 2025. Jason Gabelman : Operator : The next question is from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Jason's question, and more specifically on Golden Pass. So I guess, at this point, are you able to confirm, update the scheduled guidance for the start-up? And then the second question is just going to some of your prepared remarks. If I think about your Upstream portfolio, a lot of your growth is liquids or liquid prices linked to LNG. I think you say 80% of your Upstream is now linked to liquid business. So I was thinking, as you're building out your LNG portfolio and your trading function, is there any desire to diversify that sales mix a bit more? Or is this intentional on where you want to be? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes. Sure. I'll start with the last part of the question, which is it is a conscious decision to get weighted on liquid prices. And frankly, if you look at the LNG market. And when you're building large LNG projects, you tend to sell those out and sign contracts in advance of the investments, which the market today is linked to oil. And so we continue to have a desire to lock in a significant portion of those developments, so we've got surety on the sales side of the equation as we bring those projects up. So my expectation is we'll continue to be weighted on that, and we're very comfortable with that. In fact, there is been a huge drive since I've been in this job and brought Neil into the Upstream to basically shift the portfolio and get a little heavier weighting in the oil side. And as I mentioned, this morning on CNBC, if you look at the oil that we're producing today, we are producing more oil than at any time since the merger of Exxon and Mobil. So that strategy is beginning to manifest itself. On your Golden Pass project, so we've just gotten through -- the venture just reached a settlement with Zachry. And so that venture is in the process of kind of restaffing and getting started back up again. Obviously, we are in the very early days of that. So there is still more work to be done. And of course, the teams are very focused on getting back to work, effectively executing and bringing that project in as quickly as they can and as close to the original schedule as they can. Right now, our estimate is we are going to see about a six month slippage. So we had anticipated kind of first LNG in the middle of next year. We now are looking at probably the back end of 2025 for first LNG. And that is kind of where the current schedule is. But I would just condition that with the teams are just getting back up and running, and they have a clear mandate to try to bring that in as effectively as they can. And my -- again, my expectation is it will do better than we currently think, but we've got work to do. Biraj Borkhataria : Yeah, understood. Thank you very much. Darren Woods : Thank you Biraj. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore. Stephen Richardson : Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could circle back. I appreciate all the conversations about the projects and projects execution and how you've got a number of really important and interesting projects coming on in the Downstream in short order. Just wondering, you've added seemingly quite a bit of length to your Upstream portfolio over the last number of years. And as you think out beyond '26, '27, Darren are the teams continuing to bring you new and interesting projects in E&PS? And do you think continuing that kind of pace of integration out in the plan horizon is still interesting. Maybe you could just talk about that in terms of the investment mix and the opportunities and maybe address E&PS and chemicals as well. Darren Woods : Sure. No, I appreciate the question, Steve, because I think you touched on a really important point. I think one of the advantages of the restructuring that we've done is we no longer identify our business with the products that we are making. So if you go back in time, the functional organizations that we established, every refining organization that was producing refining products, and we had a fuels marketing organization that we marketing fuels, and we had a chemical company that's marketing chemicals. We've now combined all that into a Product Solutions organization, which is supported by a technology organization, which, again is not organized around any of our heritage businesses or heritage products, but instead is organized around core capabilities, core technical capabilities to deliver value to the businesses that they support. So while it may not be intuitively obvious, that change in structure and the way we think about and talk about the business has also opened up a lot of white space in terms of the challenge here is how do we take our core advantages, core capabilities. Some of it includes our existing footprint, but a lot of it includes our ability to upsell and to identify value and use applications, and combine that with a technology organization that's very focused on applying core technology capabilities to business challenges and business opportunities which is starting to unlock applications that frankly, in the past wouldn't have been identified because they didn't fit in the context of the organizations that we had in place. But today the aperture is much broader and the playing field is much bigger. And so we see that with Proxxima and Carbon Ventures. My expectation is as we go forward, we'll continue to talk about those markets, and we'll talk about the applications that we are developing. And the technology organization is continuing to look at how else can we use our capabilities and manipulating the molecules and particularly hydrogen and carbon molecules, to make products that society needs and at the same time reduce emissions. So I think that organization has been given a license, a hunting license go out and find how we can lean into and create more value out there and grow our earnings. So my expectation is as we go forward well beyond the 2027 time frame, we are going to continue to bring in opportunity sets as we unlock them through the work of both our Product Solutions organization but also our technology organization. And then of course, we can take advantage of our Product Solutions organization and then go off and build these things at scale and do it at a lower cost than anybody else. So I think there's a really powerful combination there. And our horizon extends well beyond the 2027 in terms of thinking through the pipeline and making sure that we're positioned to be successful well into the future. And I would just quickly add then -- and that's true for Product Solutions which has got the chemical portfolio, our specialty portfolio. And then what I would say are the energy portfolio, but more specifically the molecules that go into energy, that we expect to become feedstocks of the future like they are today for our Carbon Ventures and Proxxima ventures. On the Upstream side, we've got a lot of, obviously growth potential through the back end of this decade. But we -- this is a depletion business, we recognize that. And so that organization continues to look well beyond the 2027, 2030 time horizon, making sure that we have got a good understanding of what it's going to take to keep that pipeline full. So I feel really good about that. I think the way we've organized the businesses and the central organizations that we've put in place to serve those businesses is going to have huge payoffs here in this space. Operator : The next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Reed : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Since you all have probably the most geographically diverse set of operations of anyone we cover, I was just curious the most recent news this morning, shows maybe a few cracks in the economy. If you could kind of give us an idea as you look across the products in the chemical side, thinking that's where we really see the demand parts, what you are seeing kind of, let's say, China back around to our side of the globe? Darren Woods : Sure. Good morning. Roger, I think the key message I would leave you with across our business is when you look at kind of pricing in margins is there's two pieces, two halves to the equation, there is the demand side and there is the supply side. On the demand side, frankly to start with chemicals, we see the demand basically returning to the kind of growth that we've seen prior to the pandemic. So basically growing at 1% to 2% above GDP. And so that's back on track from a growth standpoint. Certainly, that's what we are seeing in the first half of this year. The challenge in that business with the margins has been frankly, from the supply side of the equation. We've got a lot of capacity coming on and a queue of capacity yet to come on. So that's moral of the story in chemicals, less of a demand and growth story and more of a supply story and a lot of supply coming on in the short-term. And like the past, the challenge in the chemical business, given the large chunks of capacity to come on in discrete times, that you've got to grow your -- got to grow through that capacity to get your margins back up again. One of the reasons why we stay so very focused on low cost of supply, feed advantage and, importantly performance products is to make sure that we've got advantages above and beyond the commodity cycle. And you see that playing out on our chemical business with earnings that frankly are well above what would be expected given the challenging market conditions that we see in the margin environment. China is growing despite maybe some of the \u2013 it is not growing at the rates that we've seen historically the very high rates, but still growing at a healthy clip. And as you come around to the US, we are seeing kind of reasonable economic conditions and growth in the US as well. Europe, I think is probably the most challenged area of the globe. And frankly, with some of the policies we see Europe implementing, my expectation is becoming more challenging, quite frankly and unfortunately -- particularly unfortunate for the folks living in Europe given the -- I think, the drag that the policy they are putting in place is going to put on their economy. So I think China is looking reasonable. India is growing and it looks very, very healthy. The US is looking reasonable with good growth. Demand for -- on the energy side of the equation with petroleum products continues to be very high. Record levels of demand around the world. And again, I think very good supply coming into the equation there, which is keeping -- has brought margins from those very high levels that we've seen in the first quarter and then back into last year. We are now getting back down into more typical ranges. And frankly, all of our plans anticipated that. It is always difficult to call the timing of it, but we certainly knew that the elevated margins that we were seeing in the refining business would ultimately come back into normal ranges. My expectation going forward then is we'll continue to see what I would say is historical volatility levels in that. We'll see times when the margins spike and we'll see times. And the margins are challenging. But again, we've built our refining business to be robust to those. And if you look at the work we've been doing to high-grade that portfolio, we've taken out a lot of the low-margin, less advantaged refineries and are now focused on the integrated refineries that have a mix of high value products that we are producing and are advantaged from a size and scale and cost standpoint. And then on the gas side of the equation -- and the oil side of the equation, oil demand continues to be at record levels. Last year was a record. We anticipate this year will be a record, and then next year will be a record. So demand continues to be fairly healthy from an oil standpoint. It is just a question of working through the supply that is coming on. Most of that led by what's happening in the Americas. And then on gas that's going to continue to grow in demand, and it is another -- again, a function of the capacity is coming on. So I think good news is that we are seeing the industry be very responsive to the demand. And frankly, it is very consistent with the foundation of the strategy that we put together, which is you got to be low cost, you got to be on the left hand side of the cost of supply curve. Thanks Roger. Operator : The next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Josh Silverstein : Thanks good morning, Darren and Kathy. You continue to make good progress on the cost savings front. It looks like there was an uptick of about $600 million sequentially. It looks like you've called out kind of a $200 million turnaround savings in energy products. Just wanted to see if you can provide some more examples of what's driving the improvement and how you take the current kind of $10.7 billion to the $15 billion over the next few years. Thanks. Kathy Mikells : Great. Thanks very much for the question. And so, you're right. If we look on an after-tax basis we had about $600 million overall on a pre basis for the year-to-date where our structural cost savings is about $1 billion. So making really good progress. Continuing to optimize maintenance is a big driver of overall savings. We gave a number of $200 million in energy products in terms of my prepared remarks. And that was just noting that, in the half we had a particularly heavy turnaround slate. And if we looked back at that same turnaround slate the last time we did it, we did it much more quickly and we did it at lower cost. Hence the $200 million savings number that you mentioned. We are also obviously driving savings in terms of supply chain and looking to get more efficient there. And all of our centralized organizations which we've kind of stood up over the last couple of years, are really responsible for driving savings into the business. So whether that's global business solutions or whether that's supply chain, or our global operating and sustainability group, who works on our maintenance activities, we are really starting to see the uptick from the benefit that those organizations can bring, by simplifying things and standardizing things, and bringing better data analytics to optimize our overall organization. So that's what you are going to continue to see on a go-forward basis. And then I\u2019d say, longer-term, as those centralized organizations start to standardize processes for the company which are quite disparate, as we sit here today, we'll be able to apply more technology to get, I\u2019d say, even more automated in the things that we do which will drive further efficiencies for us long term. So whether it is getting more efficient on logistics or getting more efficient because we're standardizing now between ourselves and Pioneer, standardizing all the materials and things that we're buying, those are the things that will continue to drive savings. And I think we have both the largest program, by far of anybody in the industry and now a very proven track record that we feel quite good about typically over delivering on the initial plans that we developed. So we are feeling good about the progress we're making, and that overall target to get to $15 billion in savings between 2019 and 2027. Darren Woods : Yes. And I would just -- I guess one other way to think about it, Josh is, for the first time in the history of our corporation, we've organized ourselves to take -- to focus on every aspect of delivering the business irrespective of what that business is. Look at where the synergies exist, and are now taking the experience, the collective experience of the corporation and the expertise in each of those areas and focusing it on an opportunity set. So the size of our business, it gives us a huge advantage here. And so a lot of these things you are seeing are accruing by basically taking the best thinking that had occurred in the -- around the organization around the world, and then applying that uniformly everywhere, it is relevant. And that's happening time and time and time again. And so I think a very unique capability and capacity that frankly, others can't match. And the benefits are showing up in these structural cost savings for sure. Also showing up on the revenue side of the equation with respect to better marketing, better ability to sell into value. So there's, I think, a huge benefit to the changes we've been making. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning. I'd like to paraphrase a comment Darren made, that lithium complexity is misunderstood by industry. And I'm intrigued, is that a comment around the marketing and the relative use of the Downstream side? Or is it a comment around maybe the Upstream and the complexity of processing? Darren Woods : Good morning Bob. Yes, that comment I meant to imply for more broadly, the whole low-carbon solutions business that, where as you look at each of those businesses, they've got their unique set of complexities. For lithium, in particular, you are taking what is essentially a brand-new technology, marrying that with some established technologies for subsurface, some established technologies above-surface, consistent with our processing experiences in refining and chemicals. And so putting those things together in a new business to make a product. I wouldn't say has complexities that people can't comprehend. I would just say they\u2019re new -- and there haven't been very many people who have worked way through that. Where some really unique challenges are is building brand new value chains. And the carbon capture market, as an example where there's just \u2013 there is not an existing market today that pays for carbon removal that's being incentivized with government policy. Government policy is forming, while at the same time, you are trying to build the infrastructure to support that market, the logistics, the supply and then at the same time, develop a customer base. And so the complexity that I see in the low-carbon space, that's a particularly challenging one because of all the moving parts and all the work that has to be done to try to piece those things together to come up with, frankly, a business and business model that, one, is sustainable for the long term. and two, that generates returns that are competitive in the portfolio. But I have to say, we are geared to do that kind of work. Our experience lends itself to that. And frankly, what Dan and the team is accomplishing leaning on a lot of the core capabilities of the organization, and we are tackling those challenges and making really good progress. I think on the hydrogen side of the equation, there is not a real vibrant market or a strongly economic market for low, virtually carbon-free hydrogen. So that's being developed. Obviously, the government incentives are supporting that in the short term. But we've got to work our way to a market-driven forces, so that we are competing in an open market and not relying on government subsidies. So that's, I think, one of the challenges in that space. But I think my comment was more generally that there is a lot of optimism around the low carbon solution \u2013 low carbon businesses in general. But if you think about where progress has been made to-date, most of that's been in the wind and solar and EV areas. And all of those are playing into well-established markets. The power generation market is very well established. The automotive industry is very well established. Now they are bringing in new technologies that have some of their own unique challenges, but they are not building brand-new markets. In our case, and some of the businesses we are building brand-new markets. Bob Brackett : Thanks very clear. Thanks for that. Darren Woods : You bet Bob. Jim Chapman : Thank you Bob. And thanks, everybody, for joining the call and for your questions. We're going to post the transcript of this call to the Investors section of our website by early next week. But before we wrap, I want to draw your attention to a couple of topics. First, a reminder. Later this month, we will be issuing our Annual Global Outlook, which includes our latest views on energy demand and supply through 2050, and which forms the basis for our business planning. And second please mark your calendars for our Corporate Plan Update and Upstream Spotlight, which is going to be a Wednesday, December 11. And for more information on that, again please see the Investors section of our website. So with that, have a nice weekend, and I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Jim Chapman : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. We appreciate you joining us today. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO; and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This quarter's presentation and pre-recorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our Web site. They are meant to accompany the third quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussion of our long-term plans and integration efforts, which are still being developed and which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on slide two. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our Web site. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the Web site. And now, I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks. Darren Woods : Good morning and thanks for joining us. ExxonMobil's announced earnings of $8.6 billion this morning, one of our best third quarters in the past decade. Even more importantly, this quarter's results continue to demonstrate our enterprise-wide transformation is improving the earnings power of the company. Our Energy Products business provides a compelling proof point. In 2024, year-to-date earnings are roughly double what they were in the same period of 2019 on a constant margin basis. For all of our businesses, we've been focused on reduced cost, higher-return investments, and selected divestments to improve profitability, particularly in bottom-of-cycle conditions. This work has fundamentally transformed our refining business. For instance, we've high-graded our portfolio by divesting less advantaged sites. At the time of the Exxon and Mobil merger, we had 45 refineries. In 2017, when I stepped into this job, we had 22. I expect to end this year with 15, bringing us very close to an entire portfolio advantaged by location and configuration. We've also significantly improved our product yield. By investing in assets, such as the Rotterdam Advanced Hydrocracker and the Beaumont expansion, we've increased the yield of higher-value products from lower-value feeds. Finally, we've achieved dramatic structural cost savings. In our overall Product Solutions business, we've reduced cost by $5 billion versus 2019. In Energy Products specifically, to take one example, we completed our first-half 2024 turnarounds for $200 million less than the previous turnarounds on these assets, a 24% reduction. Our results from the quarter also demonstrate the value of diversification by geography, resource, and product mix, providing natural hedges that increase the stability of earnings. In the third quarter, while liquid prices and refining margins were down, gas realizations, chemical margins, and specialty margins were all up. Underpinning our results is a relentless focus on execution excellence. We saw a good example of this in the quarter at our Joliet Refinery, in Illinois. In July, a tornado ripped through the site, cutting power, steam, instrument error and potable water. We've never had a harder shutdown. With extensive damage to the transmission system that provides power to the site, we were cold for almost two weeks. This was an unprecedented event that severely impacted fuel supplies for the entire region. Our community, the City of Chicago, local, state, and federal governments were all counting on a quick recovery. And I'm proud to say that the men and women Joliet, with a lot of support from across the corporation, delivered. Thanks to their remarkable efforts, we beat an aggressive recovery schedule and we're supplying much needed fuel to the market far faster than we thought possible, reducing the time to recover by a third. I want to take this opportunity on behalf of all of their colleagues at Exxon Mobil and the communities that depend on them to thank everyone involved in the recovery for their hard work, commitment, and personal sacrifice. Thank you. You did us proud. As always, our success is our shareholders' success. This morning, we announced a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.99 per share. We've now increased our annual dividend for 42 years in a row, putting us in an elite tier of the companies known as Dividend Aristocrats. Less than 4% of S&P 500 companies have paid higher dividends every year for more than 40 years. We've also sustained our position at top five of all S&P 500 companies with the largest dividends paid. We know how important the dividend is to our investors, particularly our millions of retail shareholders. We remain committed to a sustainable, competitive, and growing dividend, which is a key component of the attractive total shareholder return we are delivering. In the first nine months of 2024, we've generated a TSR of 20%, leading all IOCs, just as we've done over the last three, five, and 10 years. Turning to our Upstream business, the portfolio of advantaged assets we've built is the envy of the industry. In the third quarter, we grew production to 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day, a 24% increase versus the prior-year quarter. To driver higher value, we continue to improve the profitability of the barrels we produce. Our progress has been exceptional. On a constant price basis, our 2019 unit earnings were about $5.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. Year-to-date in 2024, excluding Pioneer, we've doubled that to $10.00 per barrel. The third quarter was our first full quarter with Pioneer, which added 770,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day of highly advantaged production. As we said when we announced the deal, combining our technology, Pioneer's contiguous acreage, and the capabilities of our two organizations is allowing us to recover more resource more efficiently with a lower environmental footprint. In the third quarter, we drilled the longest ever laterals on Pioneer acreage at 18,250 feet or nearly 3.5 miles. We're scheduled to spud the first ever 20,000-foot laterals on Pioneer's acreage this quarter. The benefits of long laterals are significant; fewer wells, a smaller surface footprint, and greater capital efficiency. In Guyana, we completed tie-ins for the country's Gas-to-Energy project on budget and schedule. And we are back to full production. Once the government completes the associated power plant, the Gas-to-Energy project is expected to provide the people of Guyana with electricity that is significantly cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable. This will further spur the Guyanese economy, which was the fastest growing in the world in the first-half of 2024, with GDP up 50%. Our Payara project, which remained online during the tie-ins, continues to perform above investment basis, as has been the case with all the projects we've brought online in the world's premier deepwater development. We'll have much more to say about the upstream business during our spotlight next month. I promised Neil I wouldn't steal his thunder. So, let me just say on the Pioneer synergies alone, which are considerably higher than expected, we think you'll find the story compelling. As I said many times, we're a technology company, managing and transforming molecules provide products that meet society's greatest needs and deliver attractive returns. In our low carbon solutions business, we continue to lay the groundwork for the world's largest low carbon hydrogen production facility at our integrated site in Baytown. Facility represents a new energy value chain and produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of virtually carbon free hydrogen, with 98% of the CO2 emissions captured and stored. In the third quarter, two new partners joined the project to accelerate market development for this new energy value chain. ADNOC has taken a 35% equity stake in the facility. We're pleased to add their proven experience in global market insights to this world scale project. In addition, Mitsubishi signed an agreement for the potential offtake of low carbon ammonia and equity participation in the project. The ammonia will be used to generate power and heat for industrial applications in Japan, helping to establish a new supply chain for low carbon energy. The agreement with Mitsubishi follows a similar agreement earlier this year with JERA, Japan's largest power generator. While we still have some hurdles to clear, we're encouraged by the growing market recognition of the significant value and advantages of this first in the world low carbon project. Of course, the highest hurdle as we've said is the translation of the IRAs technology agnostic legislation into enabling regulations that maintain focus on the what, carbon intensity and not the how. We are ready to move forward once the Biden administration publishes regulations consistent with the legislative intent. Assuming this happens, we plan to reach FID in 2025 with startup in 2029. We've also made noteworthy progress on the CCS front. In October, we announced an agreement with our first natural gas processing customer to transport and store 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This is our fifth agreement overall and brings our total CO2 contracted for storage to 6.7 million metric tons per year, more than any other company. In addition, we secured the largest offshore CO2 storage site in the United States through an agreement with the Texas General Land Office. The 271,000 acre site further solidifies the U.S. Gulf Coast as a leading market for carbon capture, transport and storage. In addition to LCS, we're advancing other technology driven businesses that have huge potential. We've spoken before about our Proxxima thermoset resin, which is a revolutionary new material that is stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than conventional alternatives. We see a total addressable market in the space of 5 million tons per year and $30 billion by 2030. One major application of Proxxima is rebar that is only one-fourth the weight, but twice as strong as steel. In the third quarter, we signed a licensing agreement with Neuvokas Corporation, a North American manufacturer of rebar from Proxxima. That allows rebar to be produced anywhere in the world. Rebar is just one example of Proxxima's value in use. Others include high performance coatings and a range of lightweighting applications for automobiles. In our carbon materials venture, we see a massive opportunity in the market for battery anode materials, which could grow at 25% per year and like Proxxima reach $30 billion by 2030. The primary material in battery anodes is graphite and we've developed proprietary technology that allows us to produce feedstock for next generation graphite at scale. This innovative material has potential to improve EV battery range by 30% and enable faster charging. ExxonMobil's history with transportation dates to the very beginning of the automotive age, when we provided fuel for Henry Ford's first automobiles. Some might find it ironic, but with the work we're doing in lithium for cathodes, graphite for anodes, Proxxima as a lightweight battery case and the plastics, lubricants and cooling fluids we already provide, we may become one of the most important players in a new automotive age of EVs. At our corporate plan update next month, we'll highlight how we're investing in technology-based high-return growth opportunities across all of our businesses, from the Upstream to Product Solutions, to LCS, to new growth areas. What I would leave you with today is this, all our success, our continuously improving profitability, our execution excellence, our technological innovation, and our tremendous portfolio of growth opportunities flows from our strategy and focus on fully leveraging our core capabilities and competitive advantages. The most important being our people. We have the best team in this industry; and in my view, any industry. I look forward to sharing more of their work during the corporate plan update. Thank you. Jim Chapman : Thank you, Darren. Now, let's move to our Q&A session. And as a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that, operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for the first question. Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Darren, you had some helpful prepared remarks on the downstream business. So, I actually wanted to start there. If we look at results in the quarter, they were strong and actually looks like they came in a bit ahead of what was implied by the 8-K earnings considerations, even with that Joliet impact you discussed, and softening crack spreads in the quarter. And it looks like margin capture, volume costs were all factors here. So, I was wondering if you could just talk through some of the latest trends you're seeing across your refining footprint, the drivers of that beat versus the earnings considerations, and then, specifically, how some of the strategic projects are impacting results relative to your expectations? Darren Woods : Yes, sure, Devin. I'll start with that, and then see if Kathy wants to add anything. I think you've got to step back to the broader approach that we've established with the downstream business and its integration into the new company of Product Solutions, which is really looking at how you optimize the full value chain. That, I think, is a fundamentally different approach to how we were historically running the refining business, and looking at all the value levers to pull from bringing crude in to the refineries, all the way out to marketing the products. And I think the results that we see in that business are reflective of a collection of those efforts across the whole. In addition to a lot of the cost cutting that we've doing to reduce structural cost, and the effectiveness and improvements that we're seeing by centralizing a lot of activities and bringing the best thinking of the corporation to bear on each part of the business that we're operating. A great example in the refining business has been the centralization of the maintenance approach that we're doing, not just in turnarounds, but in our routine day-to-day maintenance. That has brought a huge amount of value and lower cost to our refineries operating around the globe by taking the best thinking across both our Upstream and downstream and chemical businesses, consolidating that into a single approach, and then effectively executing that at each of the sites is driving huge value. I think two, eliminating what was somewhat of an artificial barrier between our chemical businesses in the facility and our refining business in the facility, and making sure that the organization thinks about the whole and optimizes the whole in the disposition of each stream as it flows through those facilities is having a big impact. So just I would say the optimization of the facility and the molecules that flow through those facilities, irrespective of whether it's a product that goes into the petroleum product space or whether it goes into the chemical product space, I think has been a significant uplift. And then on top of that, I would say the thinking about the channels to market and the value uplift we can get through those channels, and bringing a trading organization along and thinking about them as a value channel to optimize across the value chain that our refineries participate is also bringing additional value in making sure that we're maximizing the value and the placement value of all the barrels that come out of the refinery, and all the products that come out of the refinery. So, there is a collection of things that have been changed over the years that are fundamentally different than how we've historically been running the business. And obviously, some of those and the benefits of those will move with the market environment and the available spreads in the market. But, generally speaking, it's a combination of a lot of things that we've been working on to drive value in that business, along with the others. Kathy, anything to add? Kathy Mikells : The only that I'd add is we try pretty hard to demonstrate in the materials we provide you earnings the underlying big movers that are improving the earnings power of the company. And so, in this case, I'd say we put forward the year-to-date results more so than just the quarter because that's a bit easier then to see that coming through our results. So, if you look at our Energy Products business on a year-to-date basis, you'll see that we got about $500 million uplift from advantaged project growth, as well as cost savings, right. So, that's coming from both the Beaumont expansion as well as Permian Crude Venture, and all the structural cost savings that we're driving, not just through the Energy Products business, but obviously more broadly for the company. And then early on in the question you referenced we came in a bit better than what the Street was expecting in this area. One of the reasons we came in better was the much faster startup at Joliet. And so, we had given some guidance on what we thought that impact was going to be. And the team just did a wonderful job in restarting that facility safely and more quickly than we had expected. And that also really accrued to our bottom line. Devin McDermott : Great, appreciate the detailed response. Thanks. Darren Woods : Thank you, Devin. Operator : The next is from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes, good morning, Darren, Kathy, and team. I just want to spend some time talking about the startups of the key LNG projects. And maybe you could talk about what we're seeing in terms of de-risking Golden Pass, and bringing that into service? And then we get less visibility on what's happening in Qatar, but it's going to be a big important project, North Field Expansion. So, to the extent you're able to, can you just share your perspective of how that's going on the ground? Darren Woods : Yes, good morning, Neil. Thanks for the question. I'll just say, obviously, that the Golden Pass venture is managing the project, and we're contributing as best we can, and obviously worked with the venture in response to the bankruptcy. And that team, I think, is making really good progress at re-optimizing the work and the schedule. We anticipate today that that venture will basically be delayed by about six months. So, we expect to see first LNG out of that train back-end of 2025, to potentially slipping over into the New Year, but it'll be in that timeframe that we see. And then, of course, each train after that, we anticipate about six months' separation between the trains coming on. So, think that venture has done a lot of really good work to overcome what was a pretty challenging set of circumstance. And we feel pretty good about the path that they're on. There's still more work to do, but I think a really good vector. And the fact that the existing contractors that were involved in that venture have stepped in to fill the void and pick up the baton and keep running the race I think is a huge testament to those and their commitment to the success of this project, along with all the folks at the venture who were working this real hard. So, we stay close to it, but the venture organization there really owns that and deserves the credit for the recovery there. I think on Qatar, same thing. We're a participant in there. And QatarEnergy obviously is managing those projects. But a better place for them to give status of where the projects are. We feel pretty good about the collaboration and our ability to work hand in glove with QatarEnergy, and frankly feel really good about the competitiveness of those projects, and so are fairly engaged with those, and feel good about the work that's happening in that space. And the, obviously, we're doing work in Papua, and looking to make sure we can come with an attractive project there, and looking at opportunities to advance the Mozambique project as well. So, we've got a pretty good portfolio of LNG projects that we see going into the future. And the market response that we're seeing on the potential for those projects is very positive. So, we see strong demand signals and, frankly, a lot of customer interest. So, I feel good about the LNG business as a whole. And then I think working really constructively through the projects that are in development or under construction, and then making good progress on the concepts and the engineering for the LNG projects to come. Neil Mehta : Thanks, Darren. Darren Woods : Thank you, Neil. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggett of Wolfe Research. Doug Leggett : ,: Darren Woods : Yes, I think, there's a lot of -- as you know, having spent some time down there, Doug, a lot of variables at play. And oftentimes those investments that we make are coming in -- or coming on stream at the back end of the year. And so, part of the capacity versus production is just the timing of when we bring those projects on. Then, obviously, there's the timing of -- as we know, all these resources over time deplete. And the organization is working really hard at infill drilling and doing the other things they need to keep capacity utilization high. And so, that work and the timing of that, scheduling of that work, features into it. And so, I think a lot of those things go into it. We do our best to give all of you a good view of what we expect to be producing versus the capacity. And obviously, the organization is working really hard to do an even better job. And everyone, I think, that's working that project, and as we've demonstrated over the years, is very focused on continuing to operate those facilities in a very environmentally responsible way. We've been very pleased with the low level of flaring that they've managed to achieve. The ability to bring those facilities on really in an outstanding fashion with very low levels of flaring as they start these things up and then continue to run with no routine flaring. And then, at the same time, really push production to make sure that we're fully utilizing the capital that we put in the ground and doing that very safely. And we continue to surprise ourselves with the ability of those organizations to find ways to fill up that capital. My expectation is they'll continue to do that. Really hard to forecast exactly how successful they are going forward. But we focus on the capacity and then the targets that we're providing you. And we'll give you updates. Obviously, in our best interest, as we sharpen our plans and get a better look at things that we'll bring that forward and share it with the rest of you. And I do think when we get into December with the corporate plan reveal, I know that Neil is anxious to talk about his entire portfolio and the progress that we're making across not only Guyana but the Permian. So, we'll give you some more color commentary then as well. Doug Leggett : Great. Thanks so much. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you, Doug. Operator : The next question is from John Royall of J.P. Morgan. John Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, my question is on your balance sheet. The 5% net debt to capital is very impressive. And you're continuing to live within your means on the cash flow side, even when the cycle is turning down off of peaks. So, my question is do you consider yourselves under levered at the higher point in the cycle? And expecting to get your leverage back to higher levels as you continue a steady capital return program at the low point in the cycle, or does the fact that you've remained in the 5% or less type of range for almost two years now maybe mean that you could get a little more aggressive on returning capital and go a little higher on the leverage side? Kathy Mikells : Sure, I'm happy to take that. So, look, what we're doing with our capital structure is pretty purposeful. And I think we've been straightforward about that. We, obviously, operate in an industry that has commodity cycles. And it's really important for us and a clear competitive advantage to have an incredibly strong balance sheet to manage through those cycles and to have flexibility, right? So, you see us continuing to focus on a very strong approach in terms of capital allocation. And first and foremost, when we think about capital allocation, we think about making sure we have the firepower to invest in what are great projects with great returns. Growing things like the Permian and Guyana, investing in strategic projects in our EMPS business like China 1, which will start up next year, as well as continuing to invest in more capacity for things like advanced recycling and building our low-carbon solutions business. We then really want to make sure that we keep that balance sheet strong because we want flexibility when inevitably the market gets softer and then clearly we're looking to reward our shareholders with our success. And you would have seen that this quarter with the $0.4 quarterly dividend raise. And in Darren's comments, he mentioned it's the 42nd year in a row that our annual dividends have increased. That puts us in a quite small group of companies in the S&P 500. Only 4% of companies have that kind of longevity in terms of annual dividend growth on an ongoing basis. So, it's important to us that we're conservative now with that balance sheet to give us all the flexibility that we need through the cycles that we have to manage through. Darren Woods : Yes, and I would add to that, John, I think as we've talked about, it feels like every year I've been in the job. For us, the definition of disciplined capital spending is only investing in the things where you have an advantage, where your projects are robust to down cycles and where they deliver highly advantaged returns. And so, that portfolio of investment opportunities, were very keen on prosecuting across the cycles. And I think that's what we're always mindful of is ultimately we know there's going to be business cycles, commodity cycles, price cycles, but ultimately the demand for the products that we're trying to produce and the advantage of the projects that we're investing in to produce those products are going to be needed. And so, having the constancy of purpose there and being able to continue to invest through the down cycles are really, really critical. And so, that's fundamental to how we're thinking about this. We got good projects. We need to execute on those projects, and if we find additional opportunities as we move forward, we need to invest in those as well. That's going to drive kind of the approach that we take to the rest of the balance sheet and our capital allocation priorities. John Royall : Thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you. The next question is from Betty Jiang of Barclays. Betty Jiang : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about the Permian efficiencies and trends in general. I know we will get a lot more in December, but if we could get some early flavor on what you're seeing in the fields, specifically these 3.5 to 4-mile laterals seems really interesting. And is that part of this image that you have identified with Pioneer initially? Darren Woods : Sure. I'll start, Betty, and then, I'll let Kathy add some perspective as well. I would say, just at a very high level, we could not be more thrilled by what we're finding with respect to bringing the two organizations together and the opportunity that's in front of us I think we certainly had saw a big opportunity for Exxon Mobil to bring some of its strengths to the Pioneer acreage and the work that they were doing we anticipated the reverse happening where the organization's Pioneer could bring a lot to what Exxon Mobil was doing, but frankly, very hard for us to estimate that prior to closing the acquisition and getting together and working together. I think what we're finding through that process is there's a real big opportunity to bring a lot of what Pioneer is doing into our operations. Here's a couple of examples. They've got a world-class water infrastructure network that we're now leveraging to serve the combined assets at a much lower cost. They've got a remote logistic operations center to help on their supply chain, and we're taking full advantage of that. We just achieved an all-time Pioneer record for drilling performance in terms of lateral feet drilled per day. We're leveraging the cube design that we had and applying it to good effect in the Pioneer acreage. We're harmonizing a lot of the specifications that we have on materials and services to try to take advantage of the scale and to simplify the procurement supply chain and drive cost efficiencies. And I would just say, as everyone talks about, there's a lot of art to this drilling and completions improvements and getting the best thinking of both organizations and actually in combination, developing thoughts and approaches that neither organization came up with independently, I think is all manifesting itself, and additional synergies and we're bringing those synergies to the bottom line faster than we had anticipated and they are larger than we had anticipated. So, it's a really I think good news story and one that we're going to spend quite a bit of time talking to you about on December 11th and I know Neil and his team are real keen to share some more of the specifics to help kind of take what has been some high level indication of value and translate that down into a lot more detail so that all of you can get much more better feel in terms of what's happening there. Anything else to add, Kathy? Kathy Mikells : No, I mean we initially talked about an average of $2 billion in synergies over the next decade. Obviously that would start smaller and build and we're clearly seeing more synergies than we initially anticipated. And as Darren said, Neil will definitely enjoy the opportunity in December to give an update on that and quantify it more specifically. Darren Woods : Yes, I would just say that the focus of that team is NPV and maximizing NVP. I think the drive like we've always said, it's not a volumes game here, it's a value game here and the great news is we're seeing a lot of value. Operator : The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning. I'd like to talk a little bit about Proxxima rebar and your comments around the addressable market. If I think about steel, steel is almost 2 billion tons a year, half is construction and infrastructure-ish, rebar is $400 or $500 a ton. And so, the rebar market is something like say a $400 ish, $1 billion market. You're talking about $30 billion. How do you think it's almost heartened back to value versus volume? When you think about putting this product, which again as you said is lighter and stronger into the market, do you go for value and pricing or do you go for market share and is the $30 billion reflecting that or is that just a preliminary sort of estimate? Darren Woods : Thanks, Bob. Thanks for the question. So, I would say, we're going to have targeted areas of rebar applications that we'll look at for Proxxima. So, it's not, we're not trying to address the entire market for rebar, but for the rebar markets where we think the value and use for what we're doing is strongest and therefore generates the most opportunity for earnings growth. Necessarily, it is a segment of the rebar market that we're starting with recognizing that we're pretty early into. I think what we're finding though through that infrastructure market is, as we said at the beginning, when we're looking for opportunities is they've got to be big markets with big value use in order for it to be a material effort at some point in the future. It's got to be material with respect to ExxonMobil and so they've got to be big markets and so we're focused on that. Rebar actually in the infrastructure market is not the biggest one that where we see an opportunity. There's also a lot of advantages just using this thermoset resin as an epoxy and there are many, many applications into a number of different industrial uses that where there's great huge value in use from the epoxy and good margins and good growth opportunities. Also a lot of applications in the automotive sector, particularly as you think about EVs and light weighting, this is an incredibly strong and incredibly versatile product that lends itself to a lot of applications in the automotive industry and so longer term, we see opportunities there. And so, what we've really been focused on at Proxxima is making sure that we've got a good understanding of the value in use that we're working with customers so that they demonstrate, they can see the demonstrated value in use and make sure that we're testing out the value proposition. We've challenged the organization to put together a very aggressive plan in terms of growing Proxxima and then have established what I would say are milestones in our development of that to continue to assess, are we seeing this potential being realized and therefore earning our way to the continued emphasis on the growth and investment. And in these early days things look really, really positive. But this is a new to the world technology, new to the world processes that we're building into the planned process. And as you can tell from the way we're talking about this, we see huge opportunity here. It's very, very consistent with kind of the history we have in our historical chemical business in terms of taking molecules, developing unique applications with unique performance parameters and then selling those into large market applications and this fits right into our wheelhouse with respect to that. So, it's early days, rebar is one of the first out the gate, but I would say there's a lot more to come in this space and feeling really, really excited about this opportunity. Bob Brackett : Interesting. Thank you. Darren Woods : You bet. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bank of America. Jean Ann Salisbury : Good morning. With China 1 startup drawing closer, what is your view on the medium term Asia Chemicals market? China 1 does mostly high performance chemicals. Do we need to see a return all the way to mid-cycle CHEM's margins for that project to meet your projections? Darren Woods : Yes. I'll start with that and then hand it over to Kathy to comment on it. But I would say when we went into the China 1 project, we recognized, I'd say the macro challenges with the chemical industry, particularly in China. And so, one of the things that underpinned that investment and the thinking behind it was making sure that as you point out that it's going to be high performance, but also low cost and therefore competitive in bottom of cycle conditions and generating returns and making money in tough environments. And so, we went into that with our eyes wide open and actually as we've progressed the project feel really good about where we've ended up with the project. So, my expectation is, it will be a valuable part of the portfolio even as the market remains challenged and that challenge will exist for some time. We continue to see good demand growth, but there's just a lot of supply that the industry has to work through and it will take time for the rationalizations to occur, but we'll be in a good position as we've demonstrated to date that our portfolio is built for these tough conditions and therefore our view is once the market clears we'll see a lot more upside than we've experienced here over the last couple of years. Anything to add, Kathy? Kathy Mikells : Yes. The only thing I'd add is, for us, China is going to be one of the biggest drivers of chem growth longer term, right, as they continue to have their population kind of moving up to the middle class and longer term chem growth is usually a bit above GDP. And so, the fact that we were able to strategically place this big project in China moves us from what was 100% importation model to now having our own production there on the ground. That's very low cost. So, we would expect even though Asia continues to be in bottom of cycle conditions because of the low cost of this facility, we should get to positive cash results reasonably quickly and it will be a very resilient asset for us long-term. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great, thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you, Jean Ann. Operator : The next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria of RBC. Biraj Borkhataria : Hi, there. It's Biraj from RBC. Just wanted to ask around some recent reports in September that you were withdrawing from a farm down process in Namibia. Is there anything you can say about what you saw there that was lot of interest? Obviously, there seems to be a lot of resources discovered there, varying views on commerciality of the reservoirs. So, any thoughts there would be appreciated as well as how you're thinking more broadly about bringing inorganic opportunities into what already feels like quite a full upstream hopper? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Biraj. I would just say maybe a little more generally than the specific question on what we're seeing. One of the changes that we've made in the organization is through this value chain concept is making sure that as we're evaluating potential resources and discoveries that we are thinking about the whole end-to-end process and making sure there is a commercial and economic opportunity set there that justifies the investment. So, we know it is an integrated approach to make sure that as we are doing the work to understand the resources and what would be required to develop resources that at the same time, we're looking at in the context of the cost of developing those resources and then the economics of that cost and returns that we could generate and how even the quality of the resource to make sure that it would be competitive on the market. So, all that now today is built into the early decision making. And at the same time, the size of the opportunity has to be large enough to give us the scale advantages. So, a big difference to how we think about opportunities today versus maybe 10 years ago is if it doesn't work across that entire value chain, we don't see the full value proposition, then we're not going to be interested in it. So, I would say that's just generally the macro approach without addressing specifically any one particular area, which I'm going to refrain from doing. I think then, to the second part of your question, with respect to inorganic opportunities, I would say, look, we all know this is a depletion business. And so, I don't think we can sit at any point in time and get comfortable that you don't need to be doing anything at some point for the future because of the recognition that every barrel you produce is a barrel that's gone, and you've got to keep thinking and have in your mind that you're on this treadmill and finding new opportunities as you go. And so, I would say the organization is very active across what are the three key levers for making sure that we keep a very full portfolio of production opportunities, which is continuing to focus on technology and making sure for the things that we have today, we're maximizing the recovery of those things. Continuing to look for new resources through the exploration lens and finding opportunities in that space, organic opportunities. And then, the inorganic opportunities, looking for opportunities where we can bring a value proposition to enhance what somebody else is already doing in this space. And I'd come back to the formula that we've always talked about, which is anything that is inorganic that we're going to acquire, we have to bring and we have to see an ability to offer some unique value. So, the one plus one equals three has to be part of the equation. And if we can't convince ourselves that, that proposition is there, it's very difficult to justify making the investments. And so, that's a high hurdle to clear. And so, it's one where we've got to work real hard and continue to look for the opportunities where that opportunity is available. And I would say the emphasis that we're putting on the technology side of the equation helps with that, which is what we saw with the Pioneer acquisition. As we drive the technology to improve what we're getting out of our base business, that lends itself to opening up deal space on acquisition opportunities. That's how we think about it. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Hi, thanks. Maybe if I could ask one as we think about, maybe this is front-running, but as we think about CapEx in the 2025, is the post-Pioneer kind of normalized run rate on quarterly or annualized CapEx the right way to think about a starting point for next year or are there any material moving pieces whether it's incremental project timing or maybe even more specifically potential for cost deflation and efficiency gains and a lower part of the upstream that could push CapEx way in one direction or the other. Darren Woods : Yes, I'll start and then I'll let Kathy fill in a lot of the details. I would just, I think the one thing which you'll hear on December 11th is what Neil and the team did is this is not a bolt-on where we're kind of adding what the two organizations were doing and then going forward with that. This was kind of going back to the fundamentals, clean sheets of paper and developing up what we view as the optimum development plan across that portfolio. And so, the optimization of our efforts across the broad portfolio means that the plan going forward is different than what the individual plans of both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil were prior to the acquisition. And so, it's a new mix, it's a new development plan that that will share a level of detail on December 11. And again, what I would tell you is it's really looking at what do we see as the capability of the organization, the value opportunity, and our ability to deliver on that that's going to set the CapEx plans. But I'll let Kathy provide some additional comments. Kathy Mikells : Yes. Otherwise, I would have said, look, starting point was look at Pioneers as far as starting point, they would have been projecting their own CapEx before we put Exxon Mobil and Pioneer together at, I'll call it beginning at $4.5 billion and sort of building to the $5 billion level over time. So, that's a starting point. But we are going to be looking at the Permian holistically and we are going to be putting our collective dollars kind of into an overall production plan and program that we think is going to drive the highest levels of efficiencies and the highest returns, as Darren already mentioned. So, the one other thing I just want to take the opportunity to mention is we have been guiding to CapEx and exploration expense. We had said for this year that's going to be $28 billion. That's what we still think it's going to be. That's $25 billion for Exxon Mobil and about $3 billion for Pioneer. We're going to move to cash CapEx for our guidance going forward, and we'll talk about that more during the corporate plan. That's a metric that is consistent with what other IOCs kind of guide to, and it will make it easier for you to translate that information kind of into the cash flow that we provide when we report our results. Ryan Todd : Great, thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you, Ryan. Operator : The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. Darren Woods : Good morning. Paul Cheng : Darren, I'm interested -- thank you, I'm interested by your comment about the kinetic graphite. Is this a long term over the next 10 years or that this is like over the next five years become a potentially that a very sizable business for the company? And when I say sizable, I mean, what is your capability to ramp up the production warning within the next five years if the market is there to accept it? I mean, trying to understand that, how big are we talking about this one, and what kind of timeline are we really talking about? Darren Woods : So, yes, thanks, Paul. I think, I would talk about Proxxima and our carbon materials venture maybe collectively there, because there are two examples of basically looking at our portfolio today, looking for where we saw some advantaged feedstock, where we've got access to low-cost feedstock, and then looking at our technology and capability to take that feedstock and build a product that meets an existing need out there with additional advantage and value to customers. And that's kind of the approach we've taken across both of those. I think Proxxima, as I said earlier, we challenge the organization for both of those new opportunities to put together an aggressive schedule, what it could look like and how quickly we could ramp it. And those businesses have the potential to get fairly large moving forward in the next, call it, five to 10 years and multiple billions of dollars. That's the potential that we see in terms of our ability to ramp up production and sell into that marketplace, assuming that the technology scales up and commercializes successfully and that we get the kind of customer acceptance that we're looking for. So, that's, I think, aggressively we could make that happen, and we have -- we have set ourselves kind of a plan that allows us to achieve that, but recognizing these are new products, new technologies, just beginning to scale these things. We've got a number of steps as we move towards that broader ambition to demonstrate to ourselves that it will be successful, because we're not going to rush in and spend a lot of money until we convince ourselves that what we're seeing today, at a much smaller scale, we're seeing as we ramp this up and implement these technologies. So, the plan today has investments that grow both of those businesses in the early stage to demonstrate the value proposition that we believe is there. And assuming as we go through the next few years that we see what we expect to see there, then we will ramp up the spending and build those into the plans to build on the early successes that we're seeing. So, you think of it as milestones along what could be a very rapid growth plan, but we're not locking in the rapid growth or locking in the capital investments until we've demonstrated the success that we believe is going to be there. Kathy Mikells : Yes, the only other thing that I'd add to that and something our EMPS business is really good at we have to qualify all these new products for their in-use in any company, right? And that takes a lot of time and effort on our part. Again, it's something that our EMPS business is quite skilled at doing. We do that today as we bring new products to market. But that also creates as you do that a bit higher kind of barriers to entry, right? And again that's something we bring a lot of skill to. So, while it will take us time to build these different ventures up and the product qualifications for different applications, as we do that, we'll build growth and momentum and it will be hard for others to come in. Paul Cheng : Very good. Thank you. Darren Woods : Thank you, Paul. Operator : The next question is from Jason Gabelman of Cowen. Jason Gabelman : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the advantaged asset earnings in the quarter, which were lower quarter-over-quarter. And I'm just trying to understand the underlying drivers of that decline. If I think about it, Guyana production was down 30,000 barrels a day. Oil production from Pioneer maybe added 100,000 barrels of oil. So, it kind of implies that the Guyana earnings per unit are about 3x what you're getting from the Pioneer assets. And I wonder if that math is reasonable or if there were other factors that were contributing to that Advantage asset volume, earnings impact on the quarter? Thanks. Kathy Mikells : So, the biggest thing that impacted that, as you already mentioned, was the tie-ins for Liza-1 and 2 to the gas to energy project and that impacted our Guyana overall volumes. And so, that impact was only partially offset by getting the additional month of Pioneer kind of volumes on the other side of that. So, those were the two biggest movers. If you take a step back from that though and look at where we're at on a year-to-date basis, I mean, you really see the power of the Pioneer acquisition and Guyana volumes increasing year-over-year. So, on a year-to-date basis, our advantaged volume growth in upstream gave us almost $3 billion of incremental earnings and that's the engine that we're counting on long-term. Jason Gabelman : Okay. Was there anything that was unique to Pioneer contribution in the quarter that would have depressed it versus where it was last quarter? Kathy Mikells : Nothing unique, I mean, Pioneer's overall contribution in the quarter, just in terms of the volumes they produced, were, I would have said, pretty steady, I mean down marginally quarter-over-quarter. But again, we only took two months of the quarter from last quarter relative to three months this quarter. And in any quarter in the Permian, we're seeing growth obviously year-on-year, but on quarter-to-quarter, those results might look a little bit different. But we're really pleased overall with what we're seeing in production. I mean, we had a third quarter production record in the Permian of over 1.4 million oil equivalent barrels. So, both the ExxonMobil operation and the Pioneer operation in the Permian is going really well and obviously Darren talked a lot about the efficiencies that we're seeing as we move to the, I'd say deeper technology that ExxonMobil is bringing in its cube development and getting the best of both, both in terms of drilling and in terms of completion experience from both companies and applying that across all the acreage in the Permian. Darren Woods : And just to add on the earnings basis with the step up, you've seen increased depreciation with bringing Pioneer into the portfolio. Kathy Mikells : Yes. The last thing is I'd say if you looked at Pioneer on a cash flow basis, I mean we're already cash flow accretive, which is what we expected to see and obviously that neutralizes for the incremental depreciation that we took on through the purchase accounting last quarter. Jason Gabelman : Okay, great. Thanks for the answers. Darren Woods : You bet. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. To stay away from the December questions, let me throw one at you here on the overall op cost savings, the $15 billion total by '27, Obviously, about three quarters of that's in. I was just curious, you mentioned earlier, Darren, a technology company. Is any part of that cost savings up to the 15 related to any sort of an AI effort internally, or is it strictly the logistics as you've talked before? And if so, is there something beyond the $15 billion as you think about kind of a technology change over time? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Roger. I'll start with the end of your question, which is my expectation is there's more to come in this space and I'll talk to AI more specifically, but I would just context it more broadly in that, if you look at the transformational change that we've been making across the entire enterprise, we're very early into that process. We just this year's the plan that we are developing that we will talk to you about on December 11, the new organizations that we put in place, the GBS, the supply chain, even the trading organization, those are just they were kind of the first had some time to run and develop a full blown plan this year and so with a lot more experience under the belt and we continue to see a lot of opportunity out there that will take us time to capture. And so, I would see that there is going to be a continuum there and continued progress that we are going to make, based on the centralized approach, and the organization getting more and more efficient, but more importantly more effective at executing on the core task of driving value in the company. So, my view is that we're going to deliver on the 15 and then as we look going forward there will be more to come as that organization continues to become more effective and more efficient. The technology side of the equation I think is another area that will take longer to manifest itself, but I have a lot of optimism that the work that they're doing will ultimately drive not only I'd say the revenue side of the equation and basically higher value on that side, but also drive cost down. And so, we'll get kind of that double effect of higher revenues and lower cost to improve profitability. There's a good portfolio of things that that organization is working on and because we've now centralized that and organized ourselves around our own capabilities, we can now take the best capabilities and put them to the hardest problems, the most valuable problems, which I think are going to end up delivering a lot of good value. And AI is part of the equation. So, there is a concerted effort to make sure that we're really working hard to apply that new technology to the opportunity set within the company to drive effectiveness and efficiency. So, that's certainly part of it. Like everything that we're doing, it's a thoughtful approach. It's one where we're going to make sure that we can get the value that we anticipate. We don't like jumping on bandwagons and kind of talking in aspirational terms, but I would tell you we do see a good potential there particularly in a lot of the data rich areas of the business and the team is working on how best to take advantage of AI as a tool to help drive value there. Kathy Mikells : And I'd certainly say if I take one step up from AI and just talk about technology more broadly and especially information technology, that's a space where we continue to have a lot of opportunity. We grew up with very siloed businesses, which resulted in our processes not being very standardized or conforming across the company. That made it more difficult, I'd say, to apply single type technology applications across the company, but that's something that we're getting at today. And so, we'll be continuing to automate much of what we do today manually and that's going to drive importantly improved effectiveness as well as improved efficiency and a way better experience for our people and our customers and our vendors, because we're not always the easiest company to do business with when it comes to information technology and self-service and those types of things. So, that has a big role to play as we look forward. We have a pretty complicated kind of IT environment as we sit today and we're in the process of simplifying that which is going to drive a much higher degree of automation into the business and give us importantly way better and more timely information that will be used to make faster better business decisions to drive better results kind of in the business more generally. Darren Woods : All right. Thanks, Roger. And thanks everybody for joining the call and for the questions. We will as usual, we're going to post the transcript of this call to the Investors section of our website early next week. But before we wrap up, I want to again remind everyone we've mentioned a few times this morning of our corporate plan update and upstream spotlight, which will be held next month, December 11, and we will look forward to connecting with everyone again then. So, with that, have a good weekend. And I'll turn it back to the operator to conclude. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Jim Chapman : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to ExxonMobil's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. We appreciate your joining us today. I'm Jim Chapman, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. I'm joined by Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, and Kathy Mikells, Senior Vice President and CFO. This quarter's presentation and prerecorded remarks are available on the Investors section of our website. They're meant to accompany the fourth quarter earnings news release, which is posted in the same location. During today's presentation, we'll make forward-looking comments, including discussions of our long-term plans, which are still being developed, and which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement on Slide 2. You can find more information on the risks and uncertainties that apply to any forward-looking statements in our SEC filings on our website. Note that we also provided supplemental information at the end of our earnings slides, which are also posted on the website. And now I'll turn it over to Darren for opening remarks. Darren Woods : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I'll focus my comments this morning on ExxonMobil's 2024 results and the company we've become. In our prepared presentation available on our website, Kathy dives deeper into our results and long-term growth outlook. What our 2024 performance makes clear is that the transformed company we've built is delivering. We strengthened and further capitalized on our unique competitive advantages, technology, scale, integration, execution excellence, and, of course, people. We demonstrated the strength of our consistent strategy now in its eighth year of driving greater value for society and shareholders alike. We set and achieved ambitious objectives. When we say we'll do something, we deliver. And we expanded our unrivaled set of opportunities for profitable growth both now and long into the future. The ultimate source of cash, distributions, and shareholder value is unchanging, investments in advantaged high-return assets and projects. The proof of our transformation shows up in our performance. Operationally, we delivered strong results across the board, including safety, a bedrock commitment underpinning everything we do, reliability, where we achieved record performance in our product solutions business, and emissions, where we've achieved a more than 60% reduction in methane intensity since 2016. Financially, we demonstrated our steadily improving earnings power across a range of metrics. We delivered earnings of $34 billion in 2024, our third highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. Over five years, we've grown earnings, excluding identified items, a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 30%. We generated cash flow from operations at $55 billion, also our third highest in a decade, to fund profitable growth, maintain our financial strength, and reward shareholders. Excluding working capital, our free cash flow more than covered shareholder distributions. And we delivered a return on capital employed of 13%. Over five years, our average return on capital employed is an industry-leading 11%. When you set aside cash balances in capital and projects that are under construction and yet to start up, our 2024 ROCE rises to roughly 17%, with a five-year average of about 15%. Our disciplined approach to investing continues to generate returns well above our cost of capital. Every part of our business contributed to our success. We built the best upstream portfolio in the industry. In 2024, we achieved the highest-ever production from our advantaged assets and the highest liquid production from our overall portfolio in more than 40 years. In the Permian, we delivered record production from both our Heritage ExxonMobil assets and our Pioneer assets. Together, the two are even stronger. As we said last month, we now see an average of more than $3 billion per year of synergies from our combined assets, with production growing from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030, a more than 50% increase. This growth will further strengthen U.S. energy security and will do it with even better overall environmental performance. In Guyana, we delivered record production from the world's premier deepwater development. We've gone from discovery to 650,000 barrels per day in just 10 years, a pace for deepwater projects the world has rarely seen. The benefits are tremendous, not just profitable growth for ExxonMobil, but rapidly rising living standards for the Guyanese people. The GDP per capita more than tripling since we started production in 2020. Turning to product solutions, we've further enhanced our already industry-leading portfolio by divesting non-strategic assets and establishing the foundation for new-to-world products that outperform existing alternatives. The advantage projects we brought online over time drove record sales of high-value products in 2024. Our ongoing shift to a more profitable product mix is a key driver of earnings improvement in product solutions. We also advanced our plans to develop and grow new businesses, most notably our Proxxima resin systems and carbon materials, with an estimated total addressable market of $100 billion by 2030. Within low-carbon solutions, we demonstrated strengthened commercial interest through additional customer contracts and equity partnerships. We're the only company in the world today with an end-to-end system capable of capturing, transporting, and storing carbon emissions. At 6.7 million tons per year, we've contracted more CO2 for transport and storage than any other company by far. We're also well-positioned to meet surging demand from data centers for low-carbon power, and on a timetable that alternatives such as nuclear simply can't match. On the hydrogen and lithium fronts, we announced new equity partnerships and off-take agreements that demonstrate the significant market interest these new businesses are generating. Our success in 2024 and every other year is due to our people. It's not just that we recruit the best or that we give them the most challenging assignments to build the best capability. It's our culture, our mindset. When this team takes the field, we expect to win. That drive underpins our value creation in 2025 as well. We'll bring online a full slate of major projects to increase profitable volumes, make more profitable products, and lay the foundation for profitable new businesses. To name a few, we'll start up Yellowtail in Guyana, our fourth and largest development to date. In the Permian, we'll further improve resource recovery using our next-generation cube design and patented lightweight proppant. This is the right kind of growth, low cost of supply, low emissions intensity, and high returns. At our Singapore refining and chemical complex, our residual upgrade project, we use new-to-the-world technology to transform bottom-of-the-barrel molecules into a new grade of high-value lube-based stocks. We'll transform high-sulfur, low-value export fuels into higher-value diesel for the U.K. market at our expanded refinery at Fawley. We'll expand our capacity to produce higher-value performance polyethylene and polypropylene at our petrochemical complex in China. And we'll add new advanced recycling facilities at Baytown to meet the growing demand for certified circular polymers, which has the added benefit of keeping hundreds of millions of pounds of plastic waste from being burned or buried. Earlier this month, we sued the California Attorney General and activist groups for defamation and interference in our advanced recycling business. As our filing made clear, this suit is about abuse of the public trust and the hijacking of the legal system for financial and political gain. I want to emphasize that we don't take these actions lightly. Unfortunately, it's another example of what it takes to defend our company and preserve the value we create for our customers, shareholders, and broader society. Overall, the major projects we start up in 2025 will deliver more than $3 billion in earnings potential in 2026 at both constant and current prices and margins. And this earnings gain excludes the uplift from our Permian growth plans. As we showed at the corporate plan update, ExxonMobil's runway of profitable growth extends along into the future. Our new technology-driven businesses, such as Proxxima Products and Carbon Materials, creates huge opportunities to expand beyond traditional fuels and chemicals into higher growth, higher margin markets that are decoupled from commodity price fluctuations. This year, we expect to start up a new facility that can produce 25,000 metric tons of Proxxima products and plan to grow to nearly 200,000 tons by 2030. We're committed to investing in these new businesses in a stepwise fashion, progresses in tandem with demonstrated success in the marketplace. To change in administrations in the U.S., I want to say a few words about the right policy framework for a successful energy future. I'll begin by noting that through 2030, roughly 90% of our planned CapEx is allocated to established, fully-functioning markets for energy and products that require no policy support. Only about 10% is earmarked for nascent, lower-emissions markets where market forces have yet to fully take hold. The case in point is our Baytown low-carbon hydrogen project, which requires incentives under Section 45B of the Inflation Reduction Act to be economically viable. We believe these incentives are critical to establishing a fully market-based future where hydrogen competes head-to-head with traditional fuels. But the end goal is clear, a system where no energy source remains dependent on government subsidies. Just as energy sources should not be supported by governments in perpetuity, they should not be artificially discouraged either. The prior administration's moratorium on new LNG export facilities and its executive order limiting offshore drilling were policy mistakes that the new administration is right to reverse. Oil and natural gas remain essential to economic growth, jobs, and national security, both for ourselves, and our allies around the globe. Over the longer term, to achieve broad decarbonization, government policy should set carbon intensity standards on products. We believe this is the best way to engage the collective efforts of industry and leverage competitive market forces. To drive further innovation and reduce the most emissions at the lowest cost, policies must remain technology agnostic. Governments should not pick winners and losers. Intensity standards establish a level playing field and have a strong precedent. They were most recently used to successfully and affordably reduce sulfur and marine fuel. In closing, I want to say again how proud I am of the people of ExxonMobil and how pleased I am that we are creating unmatched value for our shareholders. Compared to the IOCs, over the last five years, we've grown cash flow from operations at a roughly 15% compounded annual growth rate, more than double the closest competitor. We've distributed more than $125 billion in dividends and buybacks, $30 billion more than the closest competitor. And we've delivered a total shareholder return compounded annual growth of 14%, 600 basis points higher than the closest competitor. Looking ahead, the value creation arc of the company is equally distinguished. We're going to build an even more advantaged asset portfolio with 60% of our option production from advantaged assets by 2030. That's nearly the same amount as the next largest IOC's total production. We're going to develop an even more profitable product mix with 80% growth of high-value product sales and product solutions by 2030. We're going to be an even more efficient operator, taking an additional $6 billion in costs out of the business. We're going to generate even more earnings in cash on a constant price and margin basis. We're confident we'll deliver 2030 by 2030, $20 billion more in earnings and $30 billion more in cash flow, all of which enables us to keep our commitment to sustainable, competitive, and growing shareholder returns. With that, I look forward to your questions. Jim Chapman : Thank you, Darren. Now let's move to our Q&A session. As a reminder, we ask each participant to keep it to just one question. And with that, operator, we'll ask you to please open the line for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Neil Mehta of Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes, thank you so much, Darren, and good rundown there. The question I had was really around project startups and specifically Guyana. Can you give us a sense of the key milestones you're watching for in 25 at this asset, how it continues to track relative to expectations? And there's been a lot of investor debate following the upstream day about what the long-term capacity of this asset could look like. So any thoughts on terminal plateau would be great. Darren Woods : Yes, sure. Good morning, Neil, and thanks for the question. I'd say as you look across the portfolio of projects that we've got slated for startup in 2025, we feel really good about where they all are, the fact that they're tracking consistent with what we've talked about publicly. And, in fact, my guess is that many of them will come in slightly ahead of that. With respect to Yellowtail specifically, I'd say we really like what we're seeing there. I think that team who's managing the Guyana developments continues to demonstrate project after project that you just find new ways to innovate and to overcome the challenges and to deliver these things below budget oftentimes and certainly ahead of schedule. And my guess will be for Yellowtail that will come in a little better than what we've publicly talked about. But 3Q25 is a good number, a good date to be thinking about. Longer term, I know I've been part of the conversation in December about what we project going forward and the capacity versus utilization. All I would say is that that's a challenging, to project that far in the future. There's a lot of variables that go into the developments across all of our upstream portfolios. We're going to move from where we're at today of roughly 10 reservoirs to roughly 40 by 2030, a lot of optimization that goes around that, managing those reservoirs, a lot of unknowns. Obviously, there's a depletion curve that continues to bring volumes down, but at the same time our teams are working hard on infills and keeping the utilization up. So we've given our best guess or estimate as to where we'll be, but I would tell you that Neil, myself, all of us, frankly, including the team who's managing it, are challenging themselves to make sure that we're fully utilizing those assets. And my expectation is, as we've demonstrated over the last several years, we'll probably do better than what we're estimating, but I think I want to make sure that we're not over-promising and under-delivering and so we've got, I think, a really sound forecast for where those units will be producing. And, again, we're challenging the team and they're challenging themselves to deliver more than that. And if I was a betting person, which I am, I would bet they'll do it. Operator : The next question is from John Royall of JPMorgan. John Royall : I was hoping for an update on your expectations around North American tariffs, assuming those are implemented and assuming they're in place for a material amount of time. You have upstream and downstream assets in Canada, but also downstream assets in the U.S. that could be impacted. So how should we think about what that could mean for ExxonMobil overall? Darren Woods : Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. I'll tell you the way that we're looking. Obviously, there's a lot of noise and speculation in this space, and I would put it in the same category as we think about prices and where prices are going. At the end of the day, what we can control is how effective and efficient we are as operators, making sure that we're producing the highest value products for the kit that we have and efficiently getting it to market. And I think that's going to, at the end of the day, no matter where the market moves, there's a cost-to-supply curve. All the work we've been doing over the last eight years has been to drive our production to the low end of the cost-to-supply curve so that we have a significant margin versus the last marginal barrel of production that's required to meet the market demand. None of that's going to change with tariffs. That's all going to get shifted around, and our view is we're going to continue to be a very cost-competitive, low-cost-to-supply source, and therefore we'll continue to outperform competition, and that's basically how we're looking at it as we kind of wade through the noise that's out there in the media and the press with respect to all the speculation around policy. Operator : The next question is from Betty Jiang of Barclays. Betty Jiang : I want to ask about your data center strategy for enabling the expansion of AI in the U.S. Carbon capture CCS value chain is a key competitive advantage for Exxon. Are you seeing any interest in the market for the low-carbon gas solutions versus just traditional gas power plants? How quickly do you think Exxon can bring these solutions to the market? And just given the recent news with DeepSeek, are you seeing any changing, too, from your conversation with the end customers? Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes, good morning, Betty. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think you hit on really what is the nexus of our strategy with respect to data centers, which is offering decarbonized power for data centers. We're not interested, as we mentioned in December, in going into a utility business like power generation. Utility returns for power generation would not compete in our portfolio, but leveraging, the end-to-end system that we have for capturing, transporting, and storing CO2 is a huge advantage and brings a lot of value for hyperscalers who are looking to have decarbonized power and to manage their emissions. And I would say that there continues to be a very strong desire for many of these customers to build data centers that are decarbonized. And so a lot of interest in that space. We're having a lot of continuing conversations. We have sites that have been selected. We've got -- we've been doing the work to decarbonize our natural gas, which would be an important feed in a low-carbon data center. And, of course, we've got the work we've been doing with our partners around carbon capture and storage, and we've got the green line. And so we've got all the pieces today. We've been in early engineering for these centers, so we know exactly what it's going to take. We've got a very, as you know, large and successful project organization. This is right in their wheelhouse. And so we're acting as a bit of an integrator in the early days to accelerate the schedules, which is really important to many of the customers. Our view is, we'll bring this on faster than anybody else in industry, and we'll certainly bring it on faster than any other opportunities for decarbonization. My guess would be, depending on how the discussions go with customers, that we could get a site up and going by 2028 and then have it decarbonized into 2029. I would say it's a rough order of how to think about that. But we're well into the development phase. Obviously a lot of dynamics here, a lot of moving parts and variables, in large part on the customer side, so we're there, we're available. We want to make sure that we've got an offering that meets their needs, and when they're ready for them, we'll be ready. With respect to DeepSeek, I would say that hasn't impacted the conversations to date that we're having with our customers. Operator : The next question is from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : So I wanted to come back to Neil's earlier question on growth. There's a lot in the queue in the near term beyond just Guyana. You highlighted 10 startups with over $3 billion of earnings, earnings that also hold the current margins, and I appreciate that guidance. But I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the timing for some of the key projects driving that growth as we move through 2025, how the impact earnings through the year, and then when you expect to get to that full over $3 billion run rate. Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes, sure. Devin, thanks for the question. I think you're right. It's going to be a busy year with a lot of startups. I'll maybe just kind of walk through the key projects that we've been talking with you all about and start with the China Chemical Complex. We mechanically completed that at the end of last year. We've been going through startup sequencing and making sure that each piece of that kit is working as designed, and we'll bring all that integrated together. And my expectation is, we'll get it started up here sometime in the first quarter, back into the first quarter. In Fawley, we're building a conversion facility to produce low-sulfur diesel. My expectation is we'll have that in early second quarter. We've got two advanced recycling units that we are building at Baytown. So despite the Attorney General's accusations that these are myths, we've actually got two more units starting up, one in the second quarter and one in the fourth quarter, which continues to see a lot of interest by consumers for recycled product. And so that capacity is desperately needed to meet that customer demand. We've got all the modules that we need for the Strathcona Renewable Diesel, looking to basically try to get that started up here in the second quarter, expect that to happen. The other real big project that we've got is the Singapore Resid Upgrade Project. That is new-to-the-world technology. I feel really good about the progress we've made there. We've got all the vessels loaded with catalyst. Some of that catalyst is proprietary. It's the largest catalyst load we've ever done, and we did that successfully and expect to be mechanically complete sometime here in the first quarter and get into the start-up and sequencing and expect to be up and running kind of the back end of the second quarter, I would hope. Proxxima, second quarter, is when we expect to get some more capacity on, and then going forward in time, a lot more capacity coming on as we continue to work with customers and sell into what we think are some very attractive applications where there's really good demand. So continue to see good progress there, and that project is coming along. Bacalhau, I expect sometime in 2025, probably closer to the third quarter. Yellowtail, third quarter, and then, as we've said, with Golden Pass, probably the back end of 2025, expect to see first LNG and mechanically complete kind of around mid-year is the time frame that we run through all of those. And then, as we mentioned, on a constant price basis, which we provide for you guys to kind of see the underlying fundamentals of these projects, expect to see more than $3 billion of improved earnings once they're up and running full, which we're considering in 2026. And at the same time, you look at the current price margin environment that we're in, which is obviously pretty challenging. We're still, as you rack up all those projects, still about $3 billion of earnings contributions. And that's, frankly, the goal is to make sure that these projects are resilient to the bottom-of-the-cycle conditions, so feel pretty good about that portfolio of projects and where we are. Operator : The next question is from Doug Leggett of Wolfe Research. Doug Leggett : Thanks for all the details. Darren, I think you missed out your 25% of [indiscernible] in your startup list, but who's counting? My question specifically is about -- I hate to be predictable. It's about your cash distribution philosophy, buybacks versus dividends. And I want to kind of position it like this. If I look at buybacks last year and the $20 billion commitment for the next two years, you could make a case that you're basically buying back the shares that you issued for Pioneer. And I know it's not as cut and dried as that, but I'm curious with the inflection in free cash flow that you clearly have, your capacity for dividend growth is substantially greater than the 4% bump that you gave to shareholders now for several years running. Are you waiting to buy in the Pioneer stock before you step up that dividend, is my question? Kathy Mikells : And so that's really, Doug, a coincidence, right, that we moved up our buyback pace in conjunction with Pioneer, obviously because Pioneer was giving us incremental cash flow to be able to do that. So that moved up our pace from $17.5 billion to $20 billion annually, and we've guided that we expect to be at that pace for this year and next year, assuming continued reasonable market conditions. But it is, I would say, just a coincidence that that $20 billion pace means that we'll essentially buy back the shares from Pioneer over a three-year period. If we go to look at our philosophy overall in terms of the dividend, we have been clear that we look at that dividend and we want it to be sustainable, we want it to be competitive, and we want it to be growing. And we're always looking at it through that lens. The share buyback program as a secondary benefit, actually reduces the overall dividend in absolute terms as we continue to take shares out of the market. But that's how we look at the dividend philosophy. And as you know, we've increased the annual dividend for 42 years running, which is a claim only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 can make. And so we're very focused on and understand the importance of that dividend for our shareholders. And we also realize compared to other companies, we have a quite large retail shareholder base that are very focused on the dividend. And so that's how we look at and evaluate things. Doug Leggett : I appreciate the answer. I would just footnote that dividend growth per share seems to be the driver or at least the mechanism for market recognition of value. So that's why we came on this issue, but I appreciate the answer. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Steve Richardson of Evercore ISI. Steve Richardson : I was wondering, Darren, now that we've had a little bit of time to sit with the corporate plan update and all the visibility you provided out until 2030, and maybe this is a beyond 2025 question, but it seems to us that internal to Exxon, the biggest risk to hitting that return on capital employed target seems to be on the CapEx line. And so I was wondering if you could kind of talk about the forward look on CapEx, upside, downside risks, any proportion that you think is market indexed versus contractual. And it would just seem to us like a lot of the things you're doing the next couple of years are replication of things that you've already executed in the last number of years, Guyana, Permian, those types of things. Thanks. Darren Woods : Yes, thank you, Steve. Appreciate the question. As we talked about as part of the corporate plan presentation in December, if you look at the CapEx profile, a large portion of it is kind of dealing with, as you say, the things that we've already demonstrated we know how to do. And frankly, the CapEx that we're spending in that space is fairly flat as we continue to grow volumes in the cash flow and earnings that go with it. So as we're advancing, I'd say, the upgrade of our existing portfolio to advantaged volumes, we're doing that with a fairly stable and flat CapEx profile, which we feel really good about. And that reflects the continued efficiency that we're finding as we apply technologies. And my expectation is as we go forward, we're learning a ton. Even as we bring in new technology and begin to apply it, we're learning on that technology and finding additional opportunities. So I think we're on a really good trajectory with respect to continuing to grow advantaged volumes and continuing to drive capital efficiency. And so that's, we've laid out our best estimate now. But again, what I would say is really like what we're finding as we deploy these technologies and see the improvements. And then on top of that, we've got the lower emissions spend that we've laid out and the new products that we're looking to, new markets, new businesses that we're looking to establish with the Proxxima resin system and the carbon material ventures, which again, we see really, really high levels of interest from customers. We're continuing with working with them in trials and testing out the product. We feel good about what we're seeing there. Those investments, which is really the growth that you're seeing with our capital spend are all conditioned on making sure that those products, the value proposition that we believe we have there is realized and compensated and generate high returns for those investments. So I'd say those are less, those are, those are contingent. We feel today pretty confident that we'll, we will pursue those investments because of what we're seeing today, but we're not going to go ahead with them until we're convinced that the value is there and we'll realize that value and the investments and get generated an advantage returns. And that's how we're thinking about it. Similar with the low carbon, we've said before where we need policy support, that policy needs to be in place and we need to have customers who are signing up for the offtakes and that work continues. And so there's, I'd say on top of the steady base that we've established here in 2024, all the additional CapEx will basically be conditioned on ensuring that we get good returns on that incremental investment in these new businesses and new opportunities. Anything to add Kathy? Kathy Mikells : So the other thing I would just say is we have a huge competitive advantage in our global projects organization. So you're talking about, Hey, one of the things is we look out and we think about continuing to improve your return on capital employed and the new projects that are coming online. That gives us great confidence. And the fact that they continue, especially in our base business to figure out how to get more and more efficient. So Guyana would be a great example of that, right? We get more and more learnings in terms of looking at those reservoirs and exactly what the kit is that we need in order to optimize production, I think is a significant advantage for us. If you look at the biggest risks, I mean, what you spend in bringing a project online is definitely has some risk associated with it. And again, I think we have competitive advantage there. What you get out of the ground, right? Understanding that, I think is really critical. And the Permian would be a great example of that. The synergies we're driving in Pioneer, as we look at recovery rates, as we look at implementing new technology, like a different approach to profit. I think those all give us really significant confidence in our ability to continue to improve overall capital return. We have an advantaged set of projects. It puts us in a very differentiated position relative to other competitors. Operator : The next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America. Jean Ann Salisbury : You have two major LNG projects coming online and are a major seller of LNG already. You've also signed some contracts to buy LNG from third parties that may now, kind of put the LNG permit ban being lifted, have a better chance of coming online later in the decade. Can you give more color on your LNG contracting strategy from here and how you see the LNG market in the medium term oversupplied or not? Darren Woods : Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think as a general context, I'd say as you look forward, we continue to see a really healthy demand and important role for LNG around the world as we go out into the future and you see economies grow and people's standards of living improve. And as countries around the world look to decarbonize and back out, coal LNG is going to play a really important role. So that broader theme we see continuing to play out well into the 2050 timeframe. So we think LNG is going to be an important product and continuing to find ways to bring on advantage supply of LNG is pretty critical to our strategy. As you know, the market today and these projects are underpinned by long-term sales contracts. We continue to progress those contracts in conjunction with the projects that we're developing. That continues to be the foundation for the LNG market. And so a majority of the production that we are looking to bring online will be underpinned by long-term contracts, which are linked to crude pricing. And that, I think, reflects really the demand that you're seeing from customers out there and the need for the continued gas. There's a portion that we're leaving uncontracted to support the work that we're doing with our trading organization and growing that business. And as that market grows, becomes more liquid. We continue to see opportunities to optimize around that market and extract some additional value through trading. And so we're making sure that we've got volume available for that. Operator : The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : A bit of a follow up on the LNG team, but more specifically around the FID cadence this year and next. We've got Papua LNG and PNG. You've got Rovuma and maybe even Coral North in Mozambique. Those are very different investments than adding another well in the Permian. What do you need to see in terms of maybe returns and certainty and maybe even local situation to give you the confidence to move forward on those multi-decadal assets? Darren Woods : Good morning, Bob. Thanks for the question. You're right that each of these projects are somewhat unique. However, what I would tell you is the constant here, in terms of how we're evaluating and deciding to go forward, is making sure that they're low cost of supply. So they're competitive supply sources in a market so that as we move forward, irrespective of how the market develops and the highs and the lows, that we have an advantaged cost of supply vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the supply curve and some of our competitors. So that's a critical component. And with that comes then an advantaged project and advantaged returns. And so that is fundamental to what we're looking at with each of these. And as Kathy mentioned earlier in the call, the project organization that we had brings a huge advantage in this space to help us drive these projects to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. I'd also add that our technology organization that we've established and the focus that they're putting on in working with the project's organization is another advantage that helps kind of drive that to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. So that's, I would say, the primary variables at play here. Obviously, we look at the stability of the area that we're in. We've got a really long history of managing that exposure and risk. We feel pretty good around what we're seeing in the local communities that we're looking at and the steps that we can take to make sure that we can develop a long-term successful business there in a stable environment. So I think that piece of it, while certainly something that we need to manage and be aware of, isn't impacting, isn't the largest variable with respect to how we think about moving forward on these projects. Bob Brackett : Very clear. So we should think 2025 for PNG and 26 for Rovuma still? Darren Woods : We're working towards the 2026 timeframe in the Rovuma. In PNG, we're continuing to work through a target. Hopefully, we'll have something near the back end of this year for FID. Operator : The next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Darren, my question is around your long-term plan for, I believe you all have suggested about growing the earnings around $20 billion in cash flow by an additional $30 billion by 2030. I think that goes along with the U.S. production. I think doubling or severely increasing. I'm just wondering, in order to achieve this, I'm just wondering, what type of levels are you all assuming on broad strokes for annual capital spend and OpEx during this period in order to achieve it? I'm just wondering, like, directionally, what are you assuming? Kathy Mikells : Sure. So, I'll start with capital because we gave guidance at our corporate plan. This coming year in 2025, we said we expect cash capex to be between $27 billion and $29 billion. And then, between 2026 and 2030, that number is $28 billion to $33 billion. And then, if you just think about expenses, obviously, we're growing, and we're growing across our business. That is going to have growth expense associated with it. And some of the offsets of that is driving significant structural cost reductions. And so, to date, since 2019, we're at a little over $12 billion in terms of structural cost reductions. And we said, between here and 2030, we expect to get that number up to $18 billion. So, kind of an additional $6 billion in structural cost savings to help to offset, just the cost of that growth overall, and, obviously, a little bit of inflation. And the last thing I would say on that topic is, we have a global procurement organization, as we talked about, the Global Projects Organization, working pretty hard to make sure that we're bringing kind of the full scale and the manner in which we integrate our business kind of to bear as we procure the different products and services that we procure. So, they're doing quite a good job, as they look to help us hold down expenses. Darren Woods : Yes, and maybe just to build on Kathy's point, if you look at where we were in 2019, we challenged the organization to pay for the growth to make sure that, as we were growing and adding some of those additional expenses associated with new facilities, new production, that we offset that through our structural cost reductions. If you look at where we were in 2019 and where we ended 2024, not only have we offset all the additional cost of the growth, we offset all the inflation and had a further reduction of about a billion and a half dollars. So, I think we've demonstrated the ability to both grow the business and grow the value while reducing cost. I think that is a very unique challenge and I think a great testament to the work that this organization has been doing to create value out there. The only other point I would make is not only do we have really solid plans to 2030, the new markets and new businesses that we're starting don't really start to move the needle until we're beyond that 2030 timeframe. And so, what I'm excited about is not only the fidelity that we have in terms of how we get to 2030 and that 2030 objective that we've talked about, but also that we've established a foundation that gives us a platform for growing well into the future in markets that are decoupled from the commodity price cycle. That's pretty exciting for our company. Operator : The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yeah. Good morning. Maybe to take a slightly different tack here on some of the policy changes, like you mentioned at the beginning of the call, Darren, some favorable changes. One of the other ones that's percolating a little bit in the executive order was for the EPA to take a look at the endangerment finding on CO2. And I know there's a lot of ways CO2 is approached in terms of what's in the IRA and stuff. But if we were to see a change in federal government regulations on CO2, how do you think about that affecting some of the decisions you're making on the renewable and low carbon investment approaches here? Darren Woods : Yea. Good morning, Roger. Thanks for the question. So let me just start with the fundamentals of how we think about this stuff, because our work and the low carbon solutions business is reflective of not any specific policy that's existing. In fact, we put that business together and started it well in advance of the IRA and some of the policy that the Biden administration brought forward. We focused instead on what we recognize as a need to continue to supply the energy sources and products that the world desperately needs to grow and for people's prosperity to improve, but at the same time reduce emissions. And I would say as a company, we recognize the need for society to reduce emissions in a thoughtful, constructive way. And what we're trying to do is offer up a skill set and a capability set that can help accomplish that. That's the long-term objective here. And putting in place the foundations for an approach that makes sense, that leverages our key competitive advantages and affordably reduces emissions while we continue to meet the needs for our products is part of the strategy. And frankly, we're demonstrating the ability to do that and to pay for it and to generate returns at the same time. And so this and equation is, we believe, a real thing in that people should be focused on doing it all. And that's what we're trying to do. So I would say that's the foundation. That's how we think about it. We recognize the demand for the reduction and the intensity of the focus on that may vary as you move across different political regimes and move around the world, and we'll move up and down with time. But the fundamentals, we believe, are there. And that's what we're focused on is the long-term game here and making sure that what we bring forward in terms of a solution is cost-efficient and very effective. And that's how we're looking at it. And frankly, from what we've seen so far, I think we've got an advantage with respect to where we're at in looking at those opportunities. And we've got an advantage with our capabilities and with the facilities that we've brought on so far and the ones that we're developing. So we feel good about that. Kathy Mikells : Yes. And the only thing I would add is, obviously, the new administration is focused on trying to streamline regulation and looking at how that can open things up for business. When we look at, just as an example, looking to permanently sequester CO2, getting that permitting has been a long process. And so it's just one area of many that you can look at across the industry to say, hey, what things can be done to ease regulation so that business can get done more quickly, projects can get put in place more quickly. And so we look forward to continuing to discuss those things with the new administration. Darren Woods : Yes. The good news, Roger, is we've got flexibility here so we can adjust as we move forward and respond to some of the changes that we see. Operator : The next question is from Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Darren, you guys clearly have an expertise in the deep water in your success, whether, say, two decades ago in Angola or recently in Ghana. But one deep water area that you are noticeable missing is the Gulf of Mexico basin. It's pretty small. I'm trying to understand that. Is it because when you guys are looking at that, you don't like about the cost structure there or you don't like about the regulatory environment or you don't like about the geologies? And as such that with the new administration they approach there, is that going to change the way that how you look at that basin? Darren Woods : Yes. Good morning, Paul. Thanks for the question. You're right that in terms of if you look around the world, our presence in the Gulf of Mexico is more limited. And I would just tell you it's a function of evaluating the opportunities there and the cost of supply. You touched on a couple of the factors. One is the cost of supply and the cost to develop there in the Gulf of Mexico. You talked about the geology. The geology is tough as well, which obviously impacts the cost. And so we look at all those factors. We are continuing to evaluate opportunities. And if the Trump administration opens up new areas for exploration, we will be in there with the rest of industry evaluating to see if we think there's an opportunity to cost effectively develop those resources. But I'll come back to. And so that's the lens we put across all of the opportunities. The Gulf of Mexico is no better off, no worse off than anything else that we're looking at. But it's really the criteria of cost-effective supply being on the low end of the cost of supply curve, making sure that we can develop those in an advantaged way that then brings advantaged returns into the portfolio. And that's the criteria that we're using. And if we find something in the Gulf of Mexico that we convince ourselves will allow us to do that, we'll develop it. If we don't, we'll continue to find and look for those opportunities in other parts of the world. We're pretty agnostic with respect to location, but we're a lot more focused on the characteristics and the ability to develop advantaged barrels. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe one on carbon capture. You have four decent sized projects set to start up over the next 24 months on your list. I know in the past you've talked about some of the challenges of effectively creating a new industry that doesn't currently exist, particularly on the commercial side. Can you maybe give some color as to how the commercial side of that business has evolved, what challenges remain, including maybe on the regulatory support side, and maybe what contribution you expect to see over the next couple of years out of the CCS business? Darren Woods : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I think a lot has happened in this space over time, and I think probably the most important development is there's been a real shakeout between people who are out there talking about a carbon capture and storage business and people who are actually capable of doing it. And that has, I think, created a lot more clarity, particularly from a customer standpoint in terms of where they need to go to find companies that can deliver on this. We are, as you mentioned, uniquely positioned here. We've got the world's only end-to-end capture, transport, and storage system. And so that puts us in a unique position to work with customers to help them decarbonize. And so I think those conversations continue to happen. There is a continued interest. We've got a fairly healthy sales pipeline that we're working with customers on. So I like how that's developed. I like our position. We continue to do a lot of work around that system that we've built and making sure that, unlike a lot of companies in this space that are limited to a single site, we've got a system and we're developing that system so that we've got a lot of optionality and take advantage of storage sites all along that pipeline. And so we feel good about having a very robust system that we can then ensure customers that, when we commit to capture their CO2 and store it, that we can effectively do that and manage any of the variables that kind of come along the pike. And so that's how we're looking at it. We've got pretty aggressive growth plans in this space. But again, all dependent upon customer interest and customers' willingness to engage in long-term contracts. And so that's what we're continuing to work on. Like I said, a lot of interest in this space, given our unique abilities. Kathy Mikells : Yeah. And what we said back at the corporate plan is, when we look at our low-carbon solutions business in its entirety, right, so obviously the CCS opportunities you just talked about, but hydrogen, lithium, everything all together, we would see $2 billion in earnings growth kind of between now and 2030. Obviously, that'll come as we pick up momentum and start to implement the projects that we've been talking about. Operator : The next question is from Biraj Borkhataria of Royal Bank of Canada. BirajBorkhataria: I just wanted to get some perspective on the chemicals market. You show a helpful slide every quarter on the margins related to a 10-year average. Obviously, the chems margin has been well below that very consistently. So do you see any signs of green shoots in that space, either regionally or product-wise, that you can talk about? And as a quick follow-on to that separately, are you able to disclose your reserve replacement ratio for the year, both total and organic? Thank you. Darren Woods : Yes. Good morning, Biraj. I'll start with that and see if Kathy has anything she wants to add. But the margins that we show and the markers that we show are kind of an industry perspective with respect to kind of the distribution of the chemical business globally around the world and the average margin that you see there. We're advantaged versus that with respect to our facilities. And so as you look across the world, I'd say the most advantaged region today is North America, where, as we've got a fairly large footprint. So we've been, despite, I'd say, very challenging conditions, I think we've been well-positioned there and very proud of the work that our folks in the chemical business have been doing to optimize and make sure that in this environment they continue to deliver earnings. The demand in chemicals is actually very strong, record levels of demand. The challenge has obviously been in the supply side of the equation. I think in terms of a green shoot comment, how do you balance supply and demand? I mean, every facility out there has to kind of figure out where they're at in the cost of supply and whether they can survive or not. I think you're seeing more and more companies that are disadvantaged with respect to their facilities evaluate their business and ability to be successful in the kind of market that we're in. The way I look at this at a macro level, these cycles are necessary. We've got to go through the lows to make sure that the industry continues to focus on efficiency and effectiveness and continuing the high grading of the broader overall industry portfolio. Our job, obviously, is to make sure that our facilities are on the high end of that high grading, and we feel really good about where we've been there. So I think that's going to continue to happen. I think from my perspective, this challenge here is not unlike the challenges we've seen in the past and, frankly, very much in line with our philosophy of you build this business to be successful in the bottom of the cycle, and then you take the gravy that comes with the top of the cycle. And so we feel good about our ability to be successful even in these bottom of the cycle conditions. Kathy, anything to add? Kathy Mikells : The only thing I'd add is if you look at the projects we're bringing online, those will continue to help us to be advantaged, whether it's the China One chemical complex that's coming online, which is really focused on performance chemicals, right, the upgrade we're doing overall in our Singapore facility, kind of resid upgrade on the margin, helps us. And then, obviously, bringing on more circular plastics basically helps us in terms of advanced recycling. So all the projects we have will continue to well position the company, and we've been very focused on ensuring that we're a low-cost supplier, which makes us resilient even in these difficult market conditions. BirajBorkhataria: Thanks. Anything on the reserve replacement ratio? Kathy Mikells : No, we don't really consider that to be particularly informative of where the company is going. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question will be from Jason Gabelman from TD Cowen. Jason Gabelman : I wanted to ask a question on Slide 6, where you lay out all the projects. And Doug alluded to it earlier. It seems like you're missing a couple of projects that are starting up here, TCO, the Permian pipeline project. We would have thought the overall potential earnings number from all the projects combined are closer to $5 billion, including those two projects. So, first, is that correct? And, second, is there any major difference you see between the earnings contribution of these projects and the cash flow contribution? Thanks. Kathy Mikells : Yes. So, I'm happy to take that. We tended to focus here on the projects where we're the operator, as opposed to TCO, where we're not the operator. Obviously, we will get some benefit from that, but we did not focus on projects that we're not the operator. We also focused on projects that are newly starting up, as opposed to projects like the Permian crude venture that is already underway. And so, I would say, yes, we clearly continue to get incremental benefits from the projects that are already underway, that the company started up pre-2025. And, obviously, to the extent that we're participating in an arrangement where somebody else is the operator and projects are starting up, we will get the benefits from those things. Darren Woods : And I would add, in terms of those other projects that you referenced, obviously, they're baked into our plans and the volumes that we shared as part of the Corporate Plan Outlook includes all elements of the projects that are coming on. Jason Gabelman : Great. And any difference between earnings and cash flow contribution from these projects? Any major difference? Kathy Mikells : No. All I would say is, typically on projects generally, there's a little bit of a lag on earnings relative to cash flow. Jim Chapman : All right, Jason. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for joining this call and for your questions. We'll post the transcript of this call to the Investor section of our Web site early next week. And have a nice weekend. That concludes today's call.",
