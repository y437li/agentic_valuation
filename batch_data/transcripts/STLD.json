And now I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Millett: Thanks Marlene, good morning everyone. Hopefully, you are all preparing for an enjoyable and safe holiday weekend, and thank you for joining us today, because we truly value your time. Nature certainly showed its fury this quarter, and I believe we weathered the storm better than most, and we are moving forward. And we have made great progress, I do believe on several fronts. And I will expand on that little later. But before we begin, I ask Theresa for brief comments concerning first quarter financial results. Theresa E. Wagler:  Thanks Mark. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2014 net income was $39 million or $0.17 per diluted share. It was on the upper range of our guidance between $0.13 and $0.17. This compares to net income of $55 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2013. Even though our net sales of $1.8 billion only decreased minimally compared to the fourth quarter. Operating income declined $27 million or 25%, this was largely due to weather. The severe weather conditions that existed throughout much of the first quarter significantly reduced earnings. Conversion cost at our Midwest steel mills increased due to higher electricity and natural gas costs. Production was reduced due to power company curtailments, and shipments were reduced due to lack of available rail cars and trucks for delivery. All of our businesses were negatively impacted in some way, and our steel operations were impacted the most. Operating income from our steel operations decreased $47 million just over 30% compared to the fourth quarter. Total shipments decreased 6%, but the severe weather impacted our sheet and structural steel operations the most. At these locations, shipments decreased, and we recorded significantly higher electricity and natural gas costs. However, stronger order activity toward the end of the quarter, and the resulting growing backlog, suggest that our customers end market demand is steadily improving, and that reduced first quarter volumes were related to the winter weather. Operating income from our metals recycling operations, decreased by $2 million compared to the fourth quarter. The decrease was directly related to costs associated with building damages from excessive snow accumulation, again weather related. Operationally, ferrous shipments and metal spread were generally flat, while non-ferrous shipments increased and metal spread improved. Fabrication is the bright spot, demand continues to strengthen, from the seasonal perspective shipments were reduced slightly, but operating income actually improved to $3.1 million in the quarter, a notable improvement over previous quarters. From a new contracts perspective more an administrative item, I just wanted to point out that the first quarter effective tax rate included a benefit of approximately $0.01 per diluted share. Towards the end of March Indiana decreased its corporate income tax rate which resulted in us reducing our deferred income tax liability. Regarding first quarter 2014 capital allocation, we utilized $27 million of cash and operations, compared to generating $66 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Working capital required an additional $120 million this quarter, an increase of $89 million in accounts receivable with the primary use of funds. The quality of our customer accounts remain high. The increase is a function of sales timing during the quarter and increased product pricing. It\u2019s not from aging accounts. We also just review the company\u2019s annual profit sharing allocations to employees in March, this totaled $23 million. Going forward we would expect working capital to be a source of funding for the second quarter of 2014. Liquidity remains strong. At March 31, our liquidity totaled $1.4 billion. This includes available cash of $343 million and the benefit of our unused revolving credit facility of $1.1 billion. Our credit metrics are also very good and well within any covenant requirements. At the end of the quarter total debt was $2.1 billion with minimal secured borrowings of just over 15% of our outstanding. Our net debt was $1.8 billion, with trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at $643 million resulting a net debt leverage of 2.8 times, which is below our preference of 3 times through the cycle. Current maturities of long-term debt were $344 million at March 31, including this amount all the convertible senior notes of $288 million that matured June 15. 16.8 million shares underlie the notes, with an expected conversion price of $17.10. Our stock price has been trading well above its amount. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong based on our low cost highly variable operating platforms which provides robust through cycle cash flow. Our capital structure has both the flexibility to sustain current operations and support future growth. To conclude, I will provide the sub-categories for those tracking our sheet shipments. For the first quarter of 2014, hot-rolled coil shipments were 263,000 tons. P&L 87,000 tons, cold-rolled coil 32,000 tons, hot-rolled galvanized, 106,000 tons, cold-rolled galvanized, 41,000 tons, painted products, 101,000 tons, and finally Galvalume, with 10,000 tons for a total of 642,000 tons of shipments in the first quarter. Mark, I\u2019d like to turn it back to you now. Mark D. Millett: Thank you, Theresa. We will begin with safety, which is the absolute highest priority for me, for each employee, and for our families. And simply said, our goal for all our employees is to work each day incident-free. Even though our results are better than industry averages, there\u2019s more to be done, and we are making progress. Our continued focus on safety is affecting positive change. Many of the teams achieved zero recordable incidents in the first quarter. My personal congratulations and thanks to those teams. A zero-incident environment is definitely achievable, and so to our team, I challenge you to that goal and keep up the great work, and I look forward to more improvement throughout the year. I also want to take a second to recognize and thank a vast majority of our employees throughout the different business segments for working effectively and most importantly, safely through the extreme cold temperatures and inclement weather conditions that occurred this quarter. And especially the men and women in Minnesota. They truly live through a brutal winter, and I thank you. So it\u2019s not news that the winter was tough, not just for the metals industry, but for the broader economy as well. Extreme temperatures and record snowfall hindered movement and consumer activities, delays and cancellations for both rail and truck transportation were prevalent. Significantly in equipment ferrous, major highways, secondary roads experienced closures. Basically, transportation was a mess, and led to the interruption of delivering of supplies, and raw materials, and shipment of product. Furthermore, energy costs went through the roof, with both gas and power curtailments. Consumers stayed at home; building sites were shut down. So I think it is no surprise, and honestly, that numerous key economic indicators were negatively impacted, and consumer settlement declined. But as I look at the window, the sun is shining and I believe spring is finally sprung. Our earlier belief that the market softness was related to severe weather, and to a temporary spike in imports, and not through an underlying structural change in growth or demand, seems to be confirmed as market indicators have improved, consumer sentiment is rising, and most importantly our order book has strengthened on all fronts. We are confident that the broader U.S. economy will continue to improve. Non-service sector growth should grow at a higher rate than overall GDP, especially over the next three to five years, based on strength and asset values, domestic energy investment, and the need for increased infrastructure spending. As you look around, for example, as things thawed, March automotive sales were at their highest level since May 2007. Expected build rate for the year is 16.5 million units, continuing to grow to 17.5 million units by 2016. Energy remains a bright spot for the U.S. in general, and for the steel industry, as it is a major consumer pipe and tube products. Energy growth will also require major infrastructure investment for natural gas and liquids transportation. Construction spending helped steady a gain for the third consecutive month, but February 2014 results exceeding 2013 by 8%. 14 February year-to-date residential spending is up 6% from 2013, which is especially strong when you know the weather challenges. In addition, the architectural billings index also improved in February, and picked up. We will benefit from this growth, especially as construction improves which also benefits all our businesses, with the inclusion of the full capacity for our recent SBQ expansion, we have annual steel shipping capability of 7.8 million tons today. Our record shipments of 6.1 million tons was achieved last year, so we still have 1.7 million tons of steel to ship, the majority of which is tied to construction markets, giving Steel Dynamics meaningful leverage to the residential and non-residential construction recovery. As steel demand increases this year, demand for ferrous scrap also improve benefitting our metals recycling operations. And finally, our fabrication operations also have a significant amount of production capability that has remained unused due to demand. As a reflection of our confidence in SDI\u2019s current and future strength of cash flow generation, and our financial position our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5% for the first quarter. As Theresa mentioned, our steel operations experienced some significant challenges during the first quarter. Production utilization decreased slightly to 86% compared to 88% in the fourth quarter. But we feel this reduction was not demand-related, but was caused by power company curtailments. Without these, utilization would have been comparable quarter-over-quarter. As a function of the extreme winter environment, spot electricity and natural gas costs skyrocketed. Most energy suppliers utilized their interruptible hours, causing increased costs, and in certain circumstances, lost production. We used the unplanned downtime for maintenance where we could, and the Flat Roll and Structural and Rail divisions were the most significantly impacted. First quarter Flat Roll Division shipments were down 13% sequentially and this is not surprising. The end markets predominantly consuming these products also experienced weather-related issues both in consumption and logistics. So good news we saw a steady improvement on our order books in March, even before the recent tightness in domestic supply. Shipments were only slightly lower for the Structural and Rail Division that higher energy costs significantly reduced earnings. Otherwise, we are seeing improved stable demand for wide-flange beams, and ended the quarter with a good order backlog. We are very excited to announce the completion of our expansion into premium rail. We are the only producer now of 320-foot standard and head-hardened premium rail in North America. We are currently in the qualification process for our premium rail with North America\u2019s Class I railroads. Further limited production runs are scheduled for the second quarter of 2014. Full production ramp-up will continue through 2014 and into 2015. We're aligned to be the preeminent supplier, based both on quality and value. Our capability to produce longer length rail that can be further welded into 1,600 foot lengths significantly reduces both installation and maintenance costs for our rail consumers. Our Engineered Bar Products division performed well in the quarter. Shipments increased 17%. The SBQ market continued to strengthen. Our customers are gaining confidence in growth, and we are seeing increased stable demand. The introduction of increased automotive and truck customers combined with strong future demand has improved our order activity At the end of March our order backlog was stronger than it\u2019s been almost two years and timing couldn\u2019t be better. Because again, great news, the team shipped prime product from the new SBQ rolling mill expansion. Further commission of this will be completed through the end of the second quarter. This expansion makes us the largest single site supplier of engineered SBQ bars in North America, with an annual production capacity of 950,000 tons. Moving to metals recycling, the quarter continued to be a challenge for the industry. Compared to the fourth quarter, the slight decrease in profitability was related to building damage caused by excessive snow accumulation. External ferrous shipments and metal spread decreased in the first quarter, as transportation hindered volume, and pricing declined in February and March. Tread over-capacity and weakened demand for exports continues to cause domestic scrap market volatility. Nonferrous volumes and metal spreads were somewhat improved, although the markets were quite frosty in the quarter. As mentioned in the press release, our Minnesota operations certainly didn\u2019t escape the impact of the cold. I believe they had 70 consecutive days of sub-zero temperatures, not a conducive environment for trials. We took a two-week hiatus to escape extraordinarily high natural gas prices, and we also didn\u2019t receive raw material that was necessary for testing until mid-April, because of the transportation delays on the Great Lakes. All that said, the learning curve was steep, and we were able to make meaningful progress during the quarter. Production rates and plant availability results confirmed the Nugget\u2019s plant, ability to produce in excess of 30,000 metric tons per month. Our primary focus has been and continues to be, on product yield improvement and production cost. And on both these fronts, we have made progress. We planned to complete the remaining tests, and our assessment of the process, in the second quarter. Positive momentum continues for our fabrication business. First quarter orders were of the magnitude typically seen in the construction-intense summer months rather than in the slow winter timeframe. Our March backlog is meaningfully higher than March of last year. Steel Joist Institute is forecasting 8% to 10% growth in 2014 and we are very optimistic that will be accomplished. Both as a function of demand improvement and the benefit of our broadened geographic footprint, we should benefit quite well. A steady increase in fabrication and wide-flange beam orders gives us confidence that the nonresidential construction is definitely in recovery. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we are focusing on opportunities to maximize our financial performance. We believe our superior operating and financial performance clearly demonstrate the sustainability of our business model, both in good and in challenging market environments. We are focused on providing exceptional value to our customers, committing to the highest levels of quality and timeliness, partnering with them to deliver what they need today and anticipate what they will need for tomorrow. As we look ahead, we are optimistic concerning the industry and even more so for Steel Dynamics. The passion and spirit of our employees compel us to a standard of excellence, to perform at the highest level. I thank each of them for their hard work and dedication and to remind them, safety is the first priority, always. Again, thank you for your time. And Melissa, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator : : Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Good morning, Mark, Theresa and Dick, and everybody. Mark D. Millett:  Good morning, Sal. Theresa E. Wagler:  Good morning. Mark D. Millett: (indiscernible) Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Thank you. A couple of questions on Mesabi. You mentioned the weather, and obviously, the project is in northern Minnesota, which obviously gets colder. Of course, there is no question that it was worse winter than we have seen in many years. Is this \u2013 did this stop you from doing your changes that you wanted to do, or the trials you wanted to run, to make sure that process improves? Or is it impacting your \u2013 if this process was running regularly, fine, would that be an issue going forward, also, if weather gets worse? Or was it just because you weren't able to run those special trials because of the weather? Mark D. Millett: Well, I think from the standpoint of availability of the plant to produce, I think the team did a marvelous job. It did drop-off a little bit compared to summer months. But each winter, I think the team learns and slowly and improves and closes certain things, and that will just continue to improve. I can\u2019t say that weather didn\u2019t impact the availability of the plant, but that will improve and can be eliminated I think going forward. I think the weather did delay the trials. Again, we shut down for a couple of weeks natural gas cost which is prohibited, it would have been nonsensical for us to continue to run at that moment of time. So that obviously delayed things a little. And certain raw materials that we want to trial, we just couldn\u2019t get them to the plant. Obviously the lake conditions remain pretty severe. Lake Superior is \u2013 I think has still about 90% ice coverage up there. And so that\u2019s going to continue to give some protracted problems, I think to a variety of different companies. But it\u2019s just a matter of getting the raw materials up there. The mills turn to rail to get the pellets to their plants, and they wield a bigger stick then we do. And so certain raw materials just didn\u2019t get there until mid-April. They\u2019re arriving and the trials, the definitive trails that we outlined in the past we\u2019ll be completed, we think in the next two, three weeks. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: When you mention raw material, isn't iron ore coming from the Magnetation joint venture, which is very close by? Is there some other raw materials we shouldn't get on the \u2013 from \u2013 through the Great Lakes? Mark D. Millett: Yes, the iron concentrate from mine resources is hasn\u2019t been a problem. There are other raw materials fluxes, different fluxes, and binders that we have been trailing, or want to trial to reduce the operating cost. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Mark D. Millett: But I think the learning curve has, as I said, have been very, very steep, I am more than confident that plant availability can be in excess of 85%, they have proven it time and time again. We\u2019re confident that we can get to 30,000 tons or slightly more per month, we don\u2019t feel that\u2019s a problem. The recent trials have certainly reduced the volumes generation which has been a focus. And I think we see an opportunity for the cash cost structure to be in the range as other products being constructed in the country today. Again we need to verify that and be sure that, with the trials we have planned in the next two, three, four weeks. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  And the other thing I have is that your operating income in the omni-source was $9.5 million, which was mostly offset by Mesabi Nugget's $8.9 million. I am just wondering, do you still have a loss of $11 million in the metals recycling? Or was it strictly IDI, which was a big component of that $11 million loss? Theresa E. Wagler: No, Sal actually you are mixing apples and oranges a bit. So the $8 million that you are referring to for Minnesota that we have in the press release, that is a net of tax number and the other numbers you are talking about are operating numbers. So you can\u2019t combine the two because if you are looking at from the operating level, you have to also include the portion of losses that are not ours because it\u2019s a joint venture. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, and was IDI profitable? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes it was. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. All right, thank you very much. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Theresa E. Wagler: You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Katz with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Dave A. Katz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. I hope you are doing well, looking at the order backlog you made several repeated dimensions of it being stronger than it\u2019s been in nearly two years. So can one look at that and then conclude that absence, the expansion that you guys have completed that volume will be reasonably up compared to the past two years second quarters? Mark D. Millett: Well, don\u2019t forget the \u2013 I think I tried to articulate this. The SBQ expansion did shipped some prime material just before the end of the quarter, as kind of advertised. They are going to continue to commission and fine-tune the process there. So I wouldn\u2019t anticipate meaningful volume, right, Dick? In the second quarter, but then in the third and fourth quarter that will start ramping up. Similarly for rail they did ship some material, prime head hardened rail, that\u2019s gone out to Class I rail routes for their final approval. And so that\u2019s going to be a sort of a commissioning trial for the next few months, I would think. Right? Richard Teets, Jr.: That\u2019s correct. I mean again when you are talking backlogs we talk about backlog strength, how far it gets pushed out not necessarily the volume increased because when you are sold out, you are sold out. And so when we talk about the commissioning of the number two mill or what we are calling at the (indiscernible) in Pittsboro. And we are only rolling let\u2019s say 2,000 tons a month on it right now, and commissioning different products on it, when you have a mill that\u2019s shipping 55, 000 to 65, 000 tons a months adding 2000 tons to it doesn\u2019t add a tremendous amount of volume. And I think we get by the end of the year if we get up to a 16,000 tons a month that\u2019s not a tremendous amount of volumes being added to it, but it is extra volume. Again with rail we are adding the premium rail to it, but its displacing standard rail. So it\u2019s again the strengthening of the margin, but it\u2019s not necessarily strengthening the order book. Our shipments there though have been improving, we definitely proving over the first quarter because of the weather and so forth. We had \u2013 I think our second heaviest shipping month in the month of March at Columbia City versus the history going all way back to 2007. So the market in whole from beams as well and now they have the additional product of rail to ship versus then, but things are improving there to. But we still have a ways to go to fill out Roanoke because of the commercial products that we make there, it is still a bit weak. But Steel West Virginia is full. Again backlog is strengthening there, but that\u2019s extending, not necessarily more volume coming out of the mill. Dave A. Katz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and then with regard to capital expenditures on the previous conference call, you guided to expenditures in all of 2014 of $125 million to $150 million or about $30 million of that was CapEx that was going to be carried over into the first quarter, it didn\u2019t look like that occurred. So a little more clarity there? Theresa E. Wagler:  Certainly, I still expect CapEx to be in that same range for the year, some of the CapEx relates to the carryover I\u2019ll just speak that in the second quarter rather than the first quarter and that just has to do with how far along we make the payments when we are completing projects, sometimes \u2013 even though the project is completed we extend the payments beyond that. Dave A. Katz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and at that time, you\u2019d also said that, you thought it could be more because that was historically relatively low number reflecting lack of specifically identified growth projects, by saying that you still expect it to be 125 to 150. Is that an indication that you haven\u2019t identified any additional growth projects that you are definitively going forward with that at this point? Richard Teets, Jr.:  I would say that we certainly identified potential growth opportunities; we haven\u2019t press the trigger on any one of them at this moment in time. Dave A. Katz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : And when would you anticipate having some additional clarity into those? Richard Teets, Jr.: Well, in the future. I don\u2019t need to be quiet, but we\u2019ve never had a habit to preempt our potential growth opportunities and so we actually want to go forward \u2013their approval. Dave A. Katz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, I\u2019ll wait until the future then. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning Mark, Dick, and Theresa, hope you are doing well. Richard Teets, Jr.: Go on. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wanted to try to get a sense of how \u2013 position you\u2019ve been in the second quarter I mean, we all see that lot of your Flat Roll competitors in the Midwest are dealing with, lack of iron ore and couple of specific mill issues and is Butler going to run full through the second quarter, do you have any maintenance you need to take there? How you\u2019ve been able to capture some of that share that\u2019s going to hanging out there? Mark D. Millett:  I think the \u2013 well, let me take a crack at just go through our platforms and then, and directly or fill in the color. But at Butler, we have a very, very strong order book as we\u2019ve always said, we tend to maintain lead times to a four-week sort of cycle for the Hot Band and probably six weeks for value add. And we all there today, and as we typically do, next week, we are likely open up the order book backup for June. So hopefully the \u2013 we can leverage the uptick in the market to a small degree. And certainly there is tightness and there is a lot of press regarding shortages of iron ore and constraints on the integrated side. But I think beyond that as I said earlier, we still see growth in demand. And I don\u2019t think people necessarily recognize how bad the weather has impacted the economy in the country. The flat rolled I think it seems obviously strength the automotive is still very strong, people were a little concerned with the inventory build in January and February. Hey, want cars buried in 3-feet of snow not many consumers are going to buy a car, the auto sales I think we abounded in March to one of the highest sales since 2007 all their effects. And a prediction to continued strength in that arena, manufacturing is seems to be little less at least from our view point. And although the residential indicators for March were a little mixed, we still are confident that is rebounding. And again I am not so sure why people were somewhat disappointed when the numbers came out yesterday its snow here in (indiscernible). So if we weren\u2019t seeing some through about a week or so it\u2019s going to take a little bit more time for people to get into the field and offering our thoughts. But we see good order profile coming into Butler HVAC, stubs raised garage door panel business. In Structural that the market I think is very stable, there is been some price appreciation over recent weeks. And I think that\u2019s certainly going to be sustained. And again when you link visibility from that the incremental increases in beam demand. And I\u2019ll let Chris, fill you in on the joist demand we see non-residential construction suddenly continue to turned up. And then with rail obviously that the railroads major railroads have large expansion plans large capital expenditures outlined for the next few years. And we see that to be a growing and good market for us particularly with the rail, premium rail coming on. Engineered bar they were beneficiary I think at the end of the last year, that we picked up market share as perhaps there are some other supply delivery issues within the industry that come during February and March where certainly seeing real demand growth there. And we are very, very confident that mill is going to be running quite well in the months and quarters ahead. But Dick mentioned Steel of West Virginia they obviously are quite depended on the truck and tractor, trailer business. And that business is anticipated to grow as (indiscernible) runs that place told me yesterday normally the year starts slow for him and ends with a roar. And he say that, that it has already started with the roar. So I think, there is a lot of freight moving and again that\u2019s a good signal for an improving economy. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color demand. And just on plant availability and is Butler kind of called up for now or do you have any big outages plan there. Richard Teets, Jr.:  Yes, I will throw the color in on that because only market everything correctly that from an availability standpoint we did have maintenance outages scheduled there. But we decided to push those off because we can\u2019t, we had four day outage plant here, our spring outage that was going to occur here in the second quarter. We decide to push that into third quarter because we can and we had an upgrade outage plan for June in Jeffersonville that for a speed increase and so forth for our Galvalume coating line that we\u2019ve pushed that into July. So that we have the opportunity to be a bigger player in the marketplace because of some of the curtailments that are going on in the flat-rolled arena, so we could make our products available and some of it is because of issues going on, we have to \u2013 we\u2019re going to step up and help our sister division in Pittsburgh The Techs or as they reach out and gain much of their supply, most of your supply normally from the marketplace, and with the tightening going on in this why we will now supply a bigger portion that we normally would, we\u2019ll do it ourselves from the Butler plant then by taking outages into the next quarter and give the marketplace a chance to recover from some of these issues that it\u2019s currently seeing itself. And we\u2019ve already from the other plants, we went through our maintenance outage at Columbia City and every things running well there. And so that is up to snuff. We have small furnace outage going to occur in May in Pittsboro, but their customers won\u2019t see that because we have a full of supply and we\u2019re currently going through a maintenance outage in Roanoke, but when it comes back, again we ship most of the outage inventory there, so customers won\u2019t have any issues. And in West Virginia there\u2019s new fall. So there are no issues that Steel Dynamics very strong and healthy. Mark D. Millett:  As I mentioned earlier, we get I think a good visibility into where the construction arena or market fell through. So Chris, would you just fill in. Chris Graham : Sure, Mark. As you and Theresa have already noted the joists market has continued its steady pattern of growth recently. I think some historical perspective on recent industry trends is important to give some color between 2009 and 2013, typical fourth quarter sales increased in total by approximately 50% typical bookings 2013, 50% higher than 2009. The rate of change increased in 2014, fourth quarter 2014 bookings were 25% higher than fourth quarter 2013. We said that\u2019s been a very impactful change for the industry. The trend has continued in the first quarter of 2014, industry bookings were up over 7% year-over-year. As far as short-term indicators going forward, our current code activity remains at or above the levels that have supported that recent increase in demand. And our longer-term indicators like the ABI and the like, are still positive. That\u2019s about as good as our crystal ball gets as far as the industry goes. I would say as far as new Millennium goes, the crystal ball is clear, we\u2019re very excited with the direction the industry is having, given the retooling we\u2019ve undergone over the last five years, and the expansion in the capacity in new markets. We have opportunities to do exciting things this year and beyond. Richard Teets, Jr.: Thanks Chris. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  And just to clarify did you say that first quarter 2014 with 25% higher than the backlog in the first quarter of 2013 is that right. Mark D. Millett: I was speaking to industry bookings just in general I apologize if I wasn\u2019t clear. Fourth quarter of 2013 was 25, I\u2019m sorry, the fourth quarter 2013 was 50% higher than fourth quarter 2009. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Gotcha, okay. Great, well thanks for all the color guys. Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Littlewood with Credit Suisse. Please precede with your question. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Good morning, guys, and thanks for the opportunity. I just had a couple more questions on this whole market share opportunity. We noticed that your days in inventory has increased from a two-year average of about 65 up to 73. So clearly, you were producing a little bit more during the quarter than what you were able to push into the end markets. And it sounds like that is largely transport-related. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the composition of that inventory, in terms of where it is, what type of product it is. Is there anything unusual about the split of that material? Theresa E. Wagler:  I will take that Nathan, this is Theresa. The inventory finished goods were increased specifically at the Flat Roll Division and the Structural and Rail division and it was specifically related to not been able to get transport out from the mills to the customers. So it\u2019s already basically sold it\u2019s just need to be transported. So I can but I will breakdown the specifics about the individual products that rail was related to Flat Roll and Structural. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Got it, okay. And with the Butler operation specifically, just to confirm your earlier comments, that thing is basically running flat out at the moment? Is that correct? There's no opportunity to increase utilization? Mark D. Millett: That\u2019s correct. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay. And when you look at the sales for Butler, can you tell us what the split is there, in terms of contract versus spot tonnage? Mark D. Millett: Well, none of our business is contracts from the standpoint of any fixed price. We have some arrangements for the on a cost plus basis. But I would say it\u2019s on, its not a whole bunch \u2013 definition, its probably 15% or there about. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay. So I am just wondering, will we see a pretty direct transfer of the recent increases in spot prices created by CIU or [Plattes] (ph) or whoever? Are we going to see that pretty much fully reflected in June quarter average selling prices, do you think? Mark D. Millett: I would suggest you will. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Yes, okay. Finally, there is obviously a lot of weather disruption right across the entire business during the March quarter. I'm just wondering, are any of those events and impacts that you felt, is any of it insurable? Or could we potentially see a recovery, at some point, of some of these disruptions? Theresa E. Wagler: The only part of that\u2019s insurable with very, very small part and that\u2019s relate to the damage to the building because it\u2019s snow accumulation and it is a de minimis amount. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Got, it. Okay. Mark D. Millett: As you translate the weather impact, as Theresa outlined, yes we had some inventory builds and so the Structural mill and sheet mill, will makeup some of those shipments. Or get some of that inventory out, so that\u2019s recoverable, but much of the \u2013 much the impact to us anyway was on the cost side. Natural gas and power, and obviously that\u2019s not recoverable. So as you look forward if you look at our first quarter, second quarter is two plus two equals four and you think that now first quarter is one and you are going to get three in Q2, that\u2019s not going to be the case. Mark D. Millett: And I think for the record both natural gas and electrical power either by contract or by hedging, we have positions taken, but no one expected the duration of these experiences to last and then at every mill we had the power company step in and exercise interruptions that were part of the agreements we have had. Where we had no ability to even by through where we were offered by through opportunities, the price was so expensive it would have been even worse than the losses incurred by not producing on those days. And so decisions had to made. And I can remember one day when there was a natural gas pipeline explosion in May and October the following day there was a natural gas curtailment here in Indiana at some of our \u2013 were only the amount of natural gas that we had pre-elected, we were allowed to use in that curtail of our production in any of the facilities where we had not pre-elected sufficient. And again what under no other circumstances in history of the company had we had to pre-elect sufficient, because we didn\u2019t know what you ever we are going to be producing. So these are \u2013 just like the 100-year flood. We had not anticipated a natural event like this. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Understood, understood. And some of your competitors have been willing to discussing some detail sort of the actual prices they have been paying for electricity and gases. Is that something you would be willing to talk about, so we can maybe have to go kind of reversing it out as we look forward into the rest of the year? Mark D. Millett: Well, market prices are I think publicly available. That in the natural gas line decatherm at one point in places. For you to back calculate or try and guess is it \u2013 it\u2019s incredibly difficult because on the power side we got many different contracts, Lumber city tends to be a market price. Butler is pretty well on a fixed-price. Incorruptibility hours which is difficult to quantify and same thing on the natural gas side. Nathan D. Littlewood \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much, I appreciate your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jarmoszuk with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with our question. Nick Jarmoszuk \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hi, thanks for taking the question. First one is on the segment of cash flows. Could you give us a little details to the sources of cash coming from other investing activities? Theresa E. Wagler: We had a sale leaseback arrangement with another company and they elected to buyback that property and so that basically was $27 million and that\u2019s really into the cash flow. Nick Jarmoszuk \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : And than in 1Q 2013? Theresa E. Wagler: In 1Q 2013 the amount was $34 million and that was simply associated with we had some investments that were not \u2013 they were not categorized as cash, even though they were short-term and so that was just bringing those investments back into a cash profile, so they had to run through the cash flow statements. Nick Jarmoszuk \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then just a follow-up on the energy and natural gas question. Would you be able to give us a sense as to what the year-over-year increase in energy and natural gas costs were in 1Q 2014 versus 1Q 2013? Mark D. Millett:  I don\u2019t have that in my finger tips here. Theresa E. Wagler: I can\u2019t answer that question; I don\u2019t have that in front of me. It was meaningful, we tended to look at it as first quarter costs, how much higher they were than the fourth quarter costs, and you kind of look more on a sequential basis than quarters. And it was definitely in the tens of millions of dollars impact. Nick Jarmoszuk \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Richard Teets, Jr.: Mark, can I make a clarification for the next question. Mark D. Millett: Yes, go ahead. Richard Teets, Jr.: I was talking 2013 and 2014; I apologize if I confused everyone. The one caller about joist bookings, I just like to restate, between 2009 and 2013, typical fourth quarter sales increased by approximately 50%, after that increase came between fourth quarter 2012 and fourth quarter 2013 alone. The first quarter of 2014 7% over first quarter of 2013. Thanks for letting me clarify that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brett M. Levy \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Two questions. First of all, Pittsboro, as you ramp up here, do you think \u2013 what\u2019s the portion of the ramp-up that is market share gain? And what is the portion of it that was actually just growth in the market? And versus your original expectations, do think the ramp-up time will be as quick as you hoped? Mark D. Millett: Are you talking rail? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes, Pittsboro. Mark D. Millett: Pittsboro. Brett M. Levy \u2013 Jefferies LLC : It's Pittsboro, SBQ. Mark D. Millett: I guess we\u2019ve \u2013 based on our thoughts and investments premise in that \u2013 much of that 325,000 tons is going to come from the market share. Brett M. Levy \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Go ahead. Mark D. Millett: And I think if you look at that market, and it\u2019s \u2013 the expansion is focused on three and five-eighths of (indiscernible). That\u2019s about 50% of the SBQ engineered market, which is typically 8 to 10 million tons. So we are looking to get 325,000 tons of a \u2013 essentially a 4.5 million ton market which we don\u2019t believe is too bigger bite of the apple, particularly when we have the following that we \u2013 the team in Pittsboro has been able to get the very, very high quality product. They are focused on the high end of the market; the engineered bar as opposed to SBQ where delivery, quality is absolutely imperative. A lot of that work is \u2013 the material, as it goes through an approval certification process for two or three years. And so I think with that following the 225,000 tons of the market is not to Richard Teets, Jr.: Yes I think Brett, what you had to think about is when we start to considering the project two is actually back prior to the drop off in the market place okay. And so even when Mark talks about the size of a market its not in a recession, it\u2019s prior to recession. And so therefore it\u2019s part of the growth but as Mark is pointing out right now I mean we have had products that have been PPAP-ed. I mean again through the automotive process and other customers. We engineered this whole design of the mill to allow us to continue to make those products smaller sizes for our PPAP-ed customers the delivery of those why we\u2019re commissioning the mill on a non- PPAP-ed, non critical products we are commissioning the mill on those products now. And then we are also now making going to begin making those products that will be submitted to the same customers for their qualification process to become PPAP-ed and then when they go through that process and get qualified then will begin the transition to allow us that take out of the choice in the flexibility of being run on either the 16 inch mill or the 14 inch mill, which ever we desire. So is it part of the rebound into the full size market that we originally contemplated when we talk about the market or are we taking some of the original it\u2019s really what you considering it, it\u2019s the full size market. And we are trying to get a small piece of it the 8% of the small bar market. But it\u2019s the market was smaller than that in the depth of the recession. And so yes is part of the recovery but we are taking market out of the recovery. But is also from somebody else. Brett M. Levy \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay. And thank you for a very specific and detailed answer. I have one more question. As you guys look at some of these growth opportunities, are you looking more towards building or buying? Mark D. Millett:  I think as we look at growth and obviously I think we are well positioned to do so. If you look at our balance sheet and our liquidity, our cash flow we\u2019re in great shape. And we are committed to growth yes we did increase our dividend in the first quarter, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think that will change in the philosophy of the company as a whole, we are being very specific, and very intentional as to where we grow. We certainly want to not just grow with the size where we want to improve that the quality of our margin. And also perhaps mitigate or soften a little bit of the locality of our business. So we are going to and are evaluating organic growth opportunities within the company or we see some there. I think we are focused on downstream opportunities our teams are very, very confident that in coating and painting arena. We feel this opportunity in rail, this considerable expansion in that arena if you look at the CapEx spending of the major railroads that the anticipation is that market is going to grow with a 1.5 million may be 1.6 million tons of rails for year, as a market is typically been in the 800,000 to 1.2 million tons a year. So we are looking at possibilities there. I think our preference would be not to add capacity to the marketplace. And I do believe that there will be opportunities over the next 12 months to 18 months, where companies are reevaluating their sort of portfolios and seeing what \u2013 which businesses accord to their particular \u2013 their vision. And those opportunities I think will come to market. And we are in a great position to assess them as they do. Brett M. Levy \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Great. Thanks and good morning. I think Dick, you mentioned earlier, with Techs, that you were going to ship some material substrate from Butler over there to displace, I believe, Monde Valley has been the more or less exclusive supplier? Can you elaborate on why the supply there is coming down? Because I didn't think Monde Valley was part of some of the disruptions we have heard. And how many tons are you going to ship from Butler? Is there a meaningful margin impact? Mark D. Millett:  No, I didn\u2019t mean to imply that they are having any problems at Mon Valley. Mon Valley supplies about half of the tons that we consume at The Techs and rest of it is out in the open market. And needless to say Sparrows point was the major \u2013 the second major supplier to The Techs once Sparrows point was around. And ever since the demise of Sparrows point The Techs have had go shopping further away and it\u2019s only because of that that the shipping costs have been become more of an acceptable condition with Butler. And we have other good suppliers, I\u2019m not saying we don\u2019t, but with the impact of the general flat rolled market, everyone is reconsidering and when there is tightness in the flat roll market all customers whoever is having difficulties go shopping to their other suppliers asking for more tons. And therefore, then there is more pricing pressure on all of the suppliers and The Techs have a harder time, price-wise, with all those other suppliers. And therefore that makes our shipping rate even lesser than issue. So that\u2019s what I was trying to imply. It had nothing to do with the Mon Valley capability. They are standup guys and they have always \u2013 we\u2019ve been a great partner with them there. So I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything whatsoever with US Steel Mon Valley. I'm sorry. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Mark D. Millett: But I think the other issue, or consideration, is that the Dick's team in Butler has done an absolute phenomenal job over the last two or three years and the capacity of that mill is growing from 2.4 million tons up to in excess of 3 million tons. A lot of that was \u2013 that expansion was going to be assorted Hot Band, because of the limitation on the coal reversing mill to convert it to cold-rolled and downstream. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Mark D. Millett: And consistent with the \u2013 consistent with the innovative sprit, the guys of just recently, two, three months ago. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes. Mark D. Millett: Came up with a way of dramatically increasing the throughput for the cold-reversing mill, so that allow us to convert some of the Hot Band to cold-rolled substrates that can be shipped to The Techs. So it\u2019s given Butler greater flexibility they ship material to The Techs or they shipping into the open market, and it is an opportunity, in all honesty, for margin expansion not margin contraction. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Okay. Second question, scrap markets, you mentioned earlier, in Q1, export scrap demand was weak. We saw some supply disruptions. Can you talk about what is happening now, in terms of the book, those elements, export, demand scrap supply, shredder capacity. Is it getting better, as we look out into the second quarter? Russell B. Rinn: Hi, this is Russ, I think on the export side we have not seen a big market difference and where we are in the first quarter. It\u2019s still somewhat muted. There have been some additional cargos of the coast. But it is not near the levels that it has been in past years at least at this point in time who is to say what will happen with the disruptions in the Russian market if that has any impact availability of either billets or scrap. But I think the export market is still lagging where it has been years past. So I think from that standpoint I don\u2019t see that having a dramatic impact in the short-term. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: And then the supply side? Russell B. Rinn: And so there is plenty of scrap available and unfortunately lot of has been buried into snow in this part of the world for the last three months. But as the weather warms up and \u2013 the scrap is out there its available particularly in the prime side where you see the automotive is really growing are continue to be robust. So that prime scrap has continue to flow the obsoletes, that is the stuff that has to go be collected in the fields has been and so little bit of a slower grade. But I think that will come back as weather or rise again but there plenty of obsoletes scrap in the U.S. it just a matter of, a function of whether its available or what its availability as the weather or what the prices that will attracted to the market place. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Murphy with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Matt Murphy \u2013 UBS Securities :  Good morning. I saw the number of steel-makers had been down in Washington. I think Dick went for you guys. And I'm just wondering if you can provide any color on the reception you got there? And what your next concern is? Is it infrastructure funding? Or how concerned are you about the potential for imports, given we've got prices rallying here in the US? Mark D. Millett:  Well, I would say that the I think from the Steel Caucus from the house was a very reception. But you would expect from the Steel Caucus Group because they are at least tuned in, to our play its matter of expanding that warm reception to those who don\u2019t necessarily have steel producers in their home districts. But talking to others as congressmen took me around and gave me some introductions, I think it was at least pleasant visit that I had the opportunity to participate. Again I think the best word that we got from trade groups and so forth, I mean that the secretary was that it was preliminary rulings, that they were still gathering information. We didn\u2019t really understand why that the rulings where, that they where when they were, it seem to be unfavorable ruling and they justify with the fact that they had not had enough information was \u2013 that you would have ruled the other direction giving a more favorable preliminary ruling. And still gathered the information and send other signals. But in order what it is. So everyone still anticipating the final decrease it come out. And so I think there is still opportunities and reasons to be optimistic about both all country tubular goods as well as rebar. So and then there are other products out there, that we have to be vigilant about cold galvanized products, painted products, like gauge particular. And so others interesting times, that we still need to be participating with products. Mark D. Millett: I think on general take is that, imports will continue to be a bit of ahead wind, once the domestic global spread gets up to that a $25, $150 a tons they start getting, attractive or some interest, but I think as the first couple of months of the year indicative of the level that\u2019s going to be sustained the whole year or is it going to be a similar year to 2013, where we seem to get a couple of spikes each year and it just so happens the first spike was at the very beginning. And I guess I would suggest that at least historically and obviously that is been global over capacity for long-time and trade imports unfairly traded imports. Been there for years. Is not a new phenomenon and if you look typically 13, 12 imports are round about $29 million, $30 million tons which seems to be a normalized level, they tend as a percentage of sort a current consumption. It\u2019s in the 20 year-on-year row, it\u2019s about 21, 22 maybe 23% and I don\u2019t see why there is anything to drive sort of a major dislocation in 2014. Matt Murphy \u2013 UBS Securities : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Philip N. Gibbs \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Mark D. Millett: Good morning, Phil. Philip N. Gibbs \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Had a question on just the SBQ volume ramp for Dick. Any way we should be thinking about that, as we move through this year, as to what your expectations are on the new rolling mill? Richard Teets, Jr.: I actually would tell you now that, this year that\u2019s again this is going to be small tons, because we are really working on a high quality as I said it starts with the 200,000 tons and by the end of the year, really honestly believe it gets up to about 16,000 tons at the end of the year per month. And that\u2019s not a big a number of tons and so, most of it is going to be around the lower end of the quality spectrum, because there is still going to be trials the sizing mill was going to becoming into play here until the end of this month, being end of June and again we are going to be experimenting with that we are going to be going through the keep act process of sending those products to customers, we won\u2019t get approval on that early even just of this year. And so because that\u2019s a very demanding process and so I won\u2019t be thinking about major margins on those products, but I think for us it\u2019s a really a 2015 excitement and then big investment for us\u2026 Unidentified Company Representative : The margin change is not going to be there. On a volume basis, if you look at the mill, you\u2019re going to have growth in the market because last year was a tough time for SBQ and engineered bar. Plus you\u2019ve got the additional smaller-diameter, so overall volumes I think quite likely could be up dramatically. Philip N. Gibbs \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, and if I could just squeeze another one here for Theresa. The corporate eliminations, they were high in the fourth quarter. I think we talked about that on the last call. This quarter, they were low. Some of that probably due to the sequential change in the profitability. But just wondering, how we should be thinking about that? Because it has moved around aggressively the last two quarters. Thanks. Theresa E. Wagler: Certainly, yes the fourth quarter still had some additional cost associate with year-end adjustments related to bonuses et cetera. And so and there was also additional expenses related to an RSU program. And so going forward you\u2019re probably going to see a \u2013 and more inline with what you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter and I wouldn\u2019t expect dramatic changes from that. Philip N. Gibbs \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lange with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lange \u2013 Morningstar Research Ltd.: Hi, good morning. Just one quick one for me. With regard to nonferrous metal recycling, it looks like nonferrous shipments, as a percentage of total scrap shipments, was higher in the first quarter, than it has ever been before, at a little over 16%. And also, you shipped more nonferrous volume internally in the first quarter than in any full year previously. Could you provide some color as to what drove these results? And are these elevated nonferrous shipment volume levels sustainable going forward? Russell Rinn : Andrew, this is Russ. The big impact of the nonferrous shipments level is the ramp up and the ramp up of our joint venture SDI/Lefarger copper mill. The bulk of that increase is coming from those shipments as we\u2019ve finally begin to ramp up and produce on a more elevated basis with that joint venture. So I think, yes, the answer is the nonferrous those numbers would sustainable going forward. Again part of the percentage difference also I\u2019d say on the \u2013 versus the ferrous, it\u2019s also due to the fact that ferrous shipment hold ups and the transportation issues slow down some of what we likely could have gotten up on the ferrous side, not a huge impact, but it has some impact on ferrous shipments. Andrew Lange \u2013 Morningstar Research Ltd.: Okay, and as that JV ramps up, do you expect those figures to even to increase from here? For internal shipments? Russell Rinn : We are planning on. Mark D. Millett: Yes. Andrew Lange \u2013 Morningstar Research Ltd.: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lipschitz with CLSA. Please proceed with your question. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : : Theresa E. Wagler:  Good morning. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC :  I guess two quickies. First one, and you haven't answered the whole energy question. Can you tell us in an earnings perspective, what do you think, just in general, all the weather cost you? Would it have been $0.05, $0.10, $0.15? What sort of, if you felt like your normal \u2013 where prices were and all that type of stuff, what you think the EPS impact would have been? Theresa E. Wagler: David, this is Theresa. Just from the perspective of the fact that they are definitely estimates, we made the decision that we don\u2019t want to disclose that information. It is the majority of the drivers, so if you look at our consolidated operating income and it decreased by I believe $25 million or $27 million. It was a major, major part of that, and I think steel operations specifically decreased $47 million and it was well more than half of that number. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And then my second one is back on the imports. You talked about the percentage historically. But if you look at the numbers already, through the licenses, and you look at what it is through the first part of April, you are running at an import level that\u2019s pretty much \u2013 or close to what you saw in 2006, which was the highest sort of level ever of imports. How do you feel when everything starts to get back online? The spread has continued to widen, the US versus the world price? How do you, when US Steel and AK and all them come back online, or \u2013 how does that impact the market, with all the imports coming? Mark D. Millett: Again it\u2019s \u2013 I think is a question of spread between domestic and foreign pricing. And markets \u2013 commodity markets have a wonderful way of balancing themselves out. The domestic price goes up, because of either demand or supply side pressure. Next the import is attractive, they come in and as we saw in February this year, the domestic market turns over a little bit. And as I said if you look at 2012 and you look at 2013, we had two very, very, very similar spikes, and they lasted a couple of months. So the question is, is the February, March, is that a similar trend, and so we are going to get a spike, things turn over little bit, and they go away and we get another one later in the year or is it a prolonged, protracted issue? I don\u2019t know who has got the clear crystal ball, but I would suggest that we are comfortable that it\u2019s not a 2006 crisis, it\u2019s just an ongoing 2012, 2013 type trend. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thanks. Mark D. Millett: And, again, I think and plus we are more optimistic than most, but we see demand growth. From our aspect \u2013 from our viewpoint, we truly see construction is coming back both on the non-res and the residential side of things, and that\u2019s going to continue to drive our market. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Luke McFarlane with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question Luke McFarlane \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. I\u2019m not sure you mentioned it. But I was just wondering if the railcar issue that you\u2019ve been talking about for your shipment delivery has actually resolved itself? Mark D. Millett: Sorry, what? Theresa Wagler : Has the railcar issue resolved itself? Mark D. Millett: It\u2019s beginning to \u2013 it, again, there is still some backup in some areas, but I think by and large, I would characterize that it has started to alleviate itself, and we are starting to see those backup cars moving and delivered and much less interruptions or unavailability of cars for either shipment or from the mills or from the scrap yards. Luke McFarlane \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.: Okay, cool, and whereabouts are the areas that are still backed up? Mark D. Millett: Again, don\u2019t have visibility across all nations. But I know Dave up in Minnesota is still struggling with cars going back and forth through the range. Richard Teets, Jr.: I had a meeting out in Colorado with just about all the major railroads, a different railroad function and they said they were in general about 85% caught up with their own, within their own systems. And they thought it would still take a few months to a clean their system out. And that they actually had resorted in some cases to a moving things by truck to help their own systems. I said, so you are the cause of my truck shortages. So had a chuckle with that. Luke McFarlane \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.:  There you go. And then just lastly, with the natural gas exposure you've got, have you ever thought about hedging any of that? Or is that something you might consider in the future? Theresa E. Wagler:  We actually do has a portion of that at each of our steel divisions and most of the divisions were hedged to a certain point some of them were exposed and that\u2019s where additional cost came to there. Luke McFarlane \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.:  Got it, thanks. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is a follow up from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please precede with your question. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Couple of things. You mentioned that, if I'm not mistaken, that you're opening the June book next week? Mark D. Millett:  (indiscernible). Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Is it yes? Mark D. Millett: Yes. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. How does it look in terms of seeing some tightness? You think it is going to be filled up very quickly? Is that your expectations? Richard Teets, Jr.: We won't know until we open it up, but when we close the book, they were floating at a phenomenal rate. And I guess as we see, our sales folks and commercial folks talk to people out there. They\u2019re warning us to open the orders up. Couple of people may have even suggest that what we were delaying to try and take advantage of the market. But actually it\u2019s not the case it just typical fourth week of the month. We open up the book for the following month, that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done. There seems to be a strong appetite. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: When was May filled out, by the way? Theresa E. Wagler:  I think it was May filled. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: When did you close May? Theresa E. Wagler: When do we close may? Richard Teets, Jr.: Well, it depends on what product you are talking about. Because we still have a little bit of opening in our light gauge galvanized and so forth. But from hot-band and so forth it\u2019s we are full. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, the other thing on rail, Dick, congratulations that you pre-shipped your first premium grade. Been waiting for it for a long time. I was just wondering, like in SBQ, there are many grades and shades. Is there \u2013 are there many grades and shades of the premium rail also? Or is this a \u2013 are you at the top of the line, where you want to be? And also, what are your expectations in terms of qualification? How long does it take, generally, to have the qualification done on premium grades? Richard Teets, Jr.: Well, each grades of the railroad has a either their own or they differ to the AREMA specification for premium rail. And we have made product repeatedly that meets the AREMA specification. And then when the railroads have qualifications that are above it, we shoot for the highest one, the ones at that have chemistries that our modifications from the AREMA, not just physical meaning hardness once that are different. Those are ones that we have not been pursuing because then if you miss it. You have a chemist a grade that\u2019s unique and then it\u2019s a hard to downgrade it. and so we have not pursued those. but the ones that are basically a heat treatment modification, those are ones that we\u2019re after and we will be sending samples to them for their analysis. but we\u2019re very confident that those will be falling in line. so we\u2019ve already, like you said, made a shipment to the first Class One railroad and expecting feedback from them. They had their samples and they\u2019ve been satisfied with the samples and that\u2019s why they agreed to take a shipment of welded rail head-hardened product. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that\u2019s you have given us in the past that the size of this market, rail market is generally between 900,000 to 1.1 million tonnes, but a steady market. I was wondering how much is the hardened rail in there? Mark D. Millett: It\u2019s a grown and continues to grow. and so I would tell you right now is probably 60% of the market used to be the other way around that used to be between 25% and 40% of the market. And now it\u2019s basically flip-flop, because of the economics over there, the price of it has come down relative to the standard rail products. and therefore, people are taking advantage of the lower differential in pricing and then putting it into the \u2013 into applications where before they found standard rail acceptable. so they\u2019re using it for reducing the maintenance cost in those arenas. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: And my assumption is that, you can also start the longer length rails in hardened equipment is able to do that? Mark D. Millett: Yes. and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve shipped, that was a lot was shipment of long rail product. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. thank you very much. Mark D. Millett: Thank you. You\u2019re welcome. Operator :  Thank you. our next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Hi, guys, I think sort of a follow-up, I\u2019ll keep it brief, I know you have other things to do today. But just quickly Theresa, what should we be using for a tax rate with the new tax roll in Indiana? Theresa Wagler : I think absent the adjustment that we saw in the first quarter is, you\u2019ll probably be looking forward at around a 38%. Evan L. Kurtz \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: 38%, okay, great. thanks, guys. Mark D. Millett: Okay. Operator :  Thank you. our next question is from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Philip N. Gibbs \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, just a last one here from me, any of you on scrap into May, any early read that you can provide there as to what you see? Thanks. Mark D. Millett: Phil, I think the trend is I think our folks look at it and see it is on the upswing at least in the short run, again, whether that is more than that is a furlong up direction, it\u2019s way too early to tell, but I think at least as we look into May, we think the trend is going to be upwards. Philip N. Gibbs \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any final and closing remarks. Mark D. Millett: Before I do that, Dick had just one follow up comment. Richard Teets, Jr.: Yes, I guess I just wanted to make a clarification, earlier when I was talking about a question, answering a question on the number two mill. the 14-inch mill, Pittsboro when I was talking about the tonnages. It was specifically directed towards the tonnages coming from the number two mill. and I said about ramping from 2,000 tonnes, up to about 16,000. when you consider, this is still April when you look at the tonnes in aggregate that becomes about 70,000, 75,000 tonnes plus or minus in the year. So those are still some significant tonnes, still tonnes downplay the expected margin impacts on it. But Pittsboro as a whole, as we have to remember when you think about year-over-year, last year, we were not running the melt shop, because of softness in the market during the daylight hours because we didn\u2019t have the order book, the backlog wasn\u2019t there, we are running flat out now. So from the whole plant perspective, we are doing \u2013 we are going to have couple hundred thousand tons of greater production in shipment. So I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I want to make sure everyone understood how excited, the whole steel platform is about the improvement in the market, the production and everything. I was specifically addressing, I thought the question after I handed the answer almost sound like a downer about Pittsboro. No I was only being very specific about the number two mill and I didn\u2019t want to raise the expectations of a major participation of that mill on the impact of that financial performance so that was my clarification. Mark D. Millett: Super, thanks Dick. Well, I guess just in closing, with the polar vortex behind us where we continue to maintain a positive view moving through 2014 into 2015. As I said earlier the residential and non-residential markets from our perspective are recovering and will allow us to start fully \u2013 averaging the $1.7 million tons of kind of latent capacity that we\u2019ve been unable to use in the past. And as that additional demand does return obviously utilization rates will increase across the nations, but should allow margin expansion to occur also. We mentioned the premium rail and the SBQ expansions, we are incredibly excited about that and look forward to them contributing. We are in great financial shape. We do have the ability to grow. We\u2019ve got great customers, and most importantly we have a phenomenal team with a passion to deliver. So on behalf of the whole team almost 6,800 of us now I\u2019d like to thank you for your time this morning and your support to our company. A special thanks to all of our customers. Our team will continue to strive to create value for you. And as I said most importantly to each employee, thank you for your commitment, you passion, and remember to be always safe, always. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our call today. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Super. Thank you, Marlene. Good morning, everybody. Hopefully, everyone is enjoying the summer months. It\u2019s certainly been a pleasant change from our first quarter conference call. We have the opportunity to speak with many of you yesterday concerning our strategic acquisition of the Severstal Columbus steel mill. And as a brief recap, the purchase is an incredibly compelling needle moving growth initiative for us. We have been positioning ourselves, our balance sheet and organizational structure for growth just like this and is exciting to see our plans beginning to unfold. We have been evaluating a number of strategic growth options for sometime now and generally excited about the step change prospects Columbus will bring us, our shareholders and our collective employees, and again, a real strong welcome to the Columbus employees to the SDI family. Acquiring Columbus is an incredible opportunity for Steel Dynamics. With the benefit of our strong balance sheet and flexible operating base, we are in a position to execute on this highly strategic and value accretive transaction. The transaction price is substantially below Greenfield replacement value, particularly considering additional working cap and capitalized interest needs of a new plant. The transaction represents a significant step in the continuation of our growth strategy and allows Steel Dynamics to leverage our strong core strengths. The acquisition introduces a state-of-the-art mini-mill into our portfolio. Columbus, which was constructed in 2007 and has a hot roll production capacity of 3.4 million tons. It will significantly expand our steel operating platform, increasing our total steel production capacity by more than 40%. We will have an annual shipping capacity of 11 million tons for the company. The mill is technologically advanced with 2D gases, thicker slab casting and rolling technology that provides greater capability than our Butler facility to make high end energy pipe scale and advanced high strength dual phase auto grades. It is fully capable of achieving the efficiency and low cost structure consistently demonstrated by our Butler team. We will also expand our geographic market presence into the Southern U.S., but exposure to growing Southeastern industrial markets and Mexico, which again is another area, where we see significant growth and upside. In short, this transaction leaves us both significant growth and exceptional financial returns all the while maintaining a prudent credit profile, which I believe is a win on all fronts. With that, shifting our focus to our second quarter results and a broader end markets, all our reporting segments achieved meaningfully higher profitability compared to the first quarter improving well beyond the bad weather impact experienced in that quarter. The meaningful improvement in our second quarter financial and operational performance supports our continued optimism as does the positive sentiment from our customers. The results are indicative for the strength of our business model and culture, both significantly important for maintaining our best-in-class position. Furthermore, we are seeing the benefits of our organic earnings catalyst that started up earlier this year. But before continuing, I would like to turn the call over to Theresa for some brief comments about our financial performance this quarter. Theresa? Theresa Wagler - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks Mark. It\u2019s great to be back online with everyone again this morning. Our second quarter results are also something to be excited about. All of the operating segments as Mark mentioned improved considerably and were well beyond recovery from the first quarter. Our second quarter 2014 net income was $72 million, or $0.31 per diluted share which was at the upper range of our guidance of between $0.28 and $0.32. An increase in net income of $34 million compared to the first quarter and an increase of $43 million compared to the second quarter of last year. While our second quarter net sales of $2.1 billion were more than 13% higher than both the first quarter and prior year second quarter, the true improvement in earnings was driven by improved margins based on both metal spread and volume-related cost compression. Second quarter 2014 operating income was $132 million, an increase of $51 million compared to the first quarter. Steel drove the increase in our second quarter operating income based on record quarterly shipments and metal spread expansion. Our scrap raw material prices decreased while steel product pricing was mixed. Sheet pricing declined in the quarter, while long product pricing appreciated resulting in our average quarterly steel price declining $2 per ton in the second quarter compared to the first. Total shipments increased 16% over the first quarter hitting a quarterly record of 1.7 million tons. This resulted in steel operating income of $158 million, or $98 per ton shipped, an increase of $50 million comparing to first quarter. Regarding our metals recycling operations, the environment is still challenging. Shipments improved and metal spread expanded for non-ferrous materials. However, ferrous metal spread contracted when compared to the first quarter. Material procurement costs remain elevated from excess shredder competition. Second quarter 2014 metals recycling operating income increased $9 million compared to the first quarter, as ferrous shipments improved 4%, while non-ferrous improved 17% primarily from improved aluminum demand. Moving on our fabrication operations continue to shine. The second quarter 2014 benefited from record quarterly shipments of 105,000 tons, which resulted from seasonable and general improvement and non-residential construction as well as market share gains. Product pricing increased in this quarter as steel cost declined expanding profitability. Additionally, volume is powerfully, excuse me, volume is a powerful lever for our fabrication operation. It allows the team to fully utilize our technologies and incentive systems resulting in dramatic cost compression of our conversion costs. Second quarter fabrication operating income increased $4.5 million to $7.6 million compared to the first quarter. For comparison purposes, this quarter\u2019s earnings alone surpassed all of 2013\u2019s results. We continue to see improvements in the underlying non-residential demand as well as an opportunity for further market gain. Good news all around in fabrication. Moving to cash flow, during the second quarter of 2014, we generated $76 million of cash from operations compared to utilizing $27 million in the first quarter of this year. Year-to-date working capital has increased $177 million with accounts receivable driving the increase. The key drivers are good things though. They are based on improved demand environment in our organic growth ramp, which impacts both accounts receivable and to a much lesser extent inventory levels. While the quantity of our receivables have increased, the quality has not deteriorated and days outstanding are appropriately maintained. Our capital structure remains strong. Liquidity was $1.4 billion at June 30. This includes cash of $357 million and the benefit of our unused $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. We are also pleased with conversion of our convertible notes which matured on June 15, 2014. The holders of 272 million of this security exercise their option to convert the notes into approximately 15.9 million shares of our common stock. The remaining $60 million of outstanding notes were repaid in cash. The conversion will net \u2013 be net cash flow positive as interest savings are more than offsetting our current dividend payment rate. This security provided an important component of our capital structure over the last five years and its conversion to equity further strengthens our financial position for growth supporting the planned acquisition of Columbus as well. Our credit metrics are again even stronger. Our net debt capitalization ratio went from 40% at June 30 to 34% \u2013 excuse me from 40% at March 31 to 34% at June 30 with total debt of $1.8 billion and net debt of $1.4 billion. Our trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was $711 million, which results in net leverage of 2.1 times. We are really in great shape. Finally, to conclude, as a brief confirmation from yesterday\u2019s call, I will summarize a few points that were mentioned. The Severstal Columbus purchase price is $1.65 billion which we intend to finance through our available cash and new debt. It\u2019s early in the transaction, so we currently believe future annual maintenance capital for Columbus will be in the range of $25 million plus as currently configured an additional $10 million to $15 million for contracted services. Additionally, we currently believe future depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $80 million to $100 million that\u2019s before any purchase price allocation that because of the recent construction of the facility, we don\u2019t expect a big step up in fixed asset base. Several of you also had asked about the Mississippi state income tax rate, for 2013 and \u201814 for income above $10,000 the rate is 5% and that compares favorably. Last year\u2019s Indiana income tax rate was 7.25%. And finally, we believe our pro forma total average will be in the range of 3.5 times at closing with a clear path to return to our preferred net leverage of less than three times within around 12 months. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong based on our low cost, highly variable operating platforms which provide robust recycle cash flow. Our capital structure has the flexibility to sustain current operations and more importantly support our growth. Mark? Mark Millett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Super. Thanks Theresa. Well, we will begin with safety and as I consistently communicate it\u2019s the absolute highest priority for me, for each employee and for our families. Simply said, our goal is for all employees who work each day incident free. Even though our results are better than industry averages, I believe there is more to be done and we continue to make progress. Towards that goal 90 of our 119 locations achieved zero recordable incidents through June. My personal congratulations and thanks to those teams. Thank you for demonstrating that our goal to reach zero accidents is achievable and is sustainable. Keep up the great safe work. Corporately, our safety results continue to be better than industry averages. As we suggested, the first quarter softness in the U.S. economy was weather-related and temporary and not a structural change in the progress of the economic recovery. As the U.S. economy regained its growth momentum and continues to improve, we believe the non-services sector growth is capable of increasing at a higher rate than the overall GDP. And we continue to see evidence of this. As the employment rate continuing to improve, consumer confidence followed. The June consumer sentiment index was the highest level obtained since January 2008. The automotive market remained strong, sales continue to outpace expectations. The expected build rate for 2014 is currently 16.5 million units and is forecast to grow to 17.8 million units over the next couple of years. Energy certainly one of the brightest spots for the U.S. is a significant contributor to overall domestic steel consumption. The U.S. oil rig count continues to increase. And for the first time in 19 years, the U.S. is producing more oil than its importing. Fixed asset investments that support the domestic energy market are and will continue to be needed. The manufacturing sector particularly for end use products that require steel continues to strengthen. And very importantly, construction we believe also continues to improve. Through May residential construction is up 9% year-over-year. Non-residential construction also continues to trend upward and through May has increased 8% year-over-year. And for us more important than the macro market indicators is the strength of our order books and we continue to see them strengthen across our steel and fabrication segments. Our steel operations segment had a strong second quarter both financially and operationally. They shipped a record 1.7 million tons both flat-rolled and structural and rail divisions hit quarterly records. Structural and rail division achieved the new monthly shipping record in June, the majority of the increase being from steel beams although rail continues to head upward momentum as well. We continue to work closely with the Class I railroads through their qualification process for our premium rail. The quality of our premium rail is receiving high praise from our customers. Premium rail expansion positions us to become the preeminent supplier in North America as measured by product quality and value. We are the only North American producer of 320 foot long rail which is a strong competitive advantage for us. Additionally, we are able to weld these longer rails together to produce 1600 foot length standard or premium rails that require significantly fewer weld points than our competition. That creates significant value for our railroad customers through reduced installation cost, lower ongoing track maintenance expense and is importantly improved rail safety. Our new engineered bars smaller diameter rolling mill is on scheduled to be fully commissioned this month. Our customers are pleased with the limited product we ship to-date. Throughout the expansion, the team is not distracted from its principal task delivering quality products to our customers. The team maintained a superior performance in quality and customer service as evidenced by the second quarter Jacobson & Associates survey results. They were ranked the number one domestic SBQ mill overall. Quite a feat, given the tremendous effort required for the expansion project, so very kudos for the team now. We have heard comments regarding the impact of SBQ capacity being built and its impact on our ability to fully utilize the new 325,000 tons of capacity. Our expansion is specific to the small diameter bar market which is approximately 4 million to 5 million tons of the total SBQ arena. So we are not taking a big bite of the apple. Furthermore, we are confident that our trusted customer relationships that have been built on quality and on-time delivery will allow us to increase that market share. Our steel mill utilization rate increased to 90% in the quarter across all our mills, positively influencing the steel operations profitability as high utilization resulted in cost compression. Of note, our flat roll division achieved two back to back record Hot Band production months, an incredible achievement for that mill. We continue to see our steel order book strengthen and in spite of the recent elevation in volume of imported steel during the quarter, likewise the domestic industry utilization has edged up. The considerable global overcapacity will certainly be a headwind to steel pricing for the foreseeable future. But I believe that historic true cycle level of imports as a percentage of demand will continue to remain in the low to mid-20% range and that we will not see a glut of any consequence on a sustained basis. Nonetheless, as an American steel producer, we understand and desire the dynamics of a competitive market as long as its fair and it\u2019s equitable. We must remain vigilant as a nation and our administration must enforce world trade laws in order for us to compete on a level playing field. Our metals recycling business continued to work through another challenging quarter and the team did a good job managing through it. The Midwest region realized scrap flow improvement in both ferrous and non-ferrous volume as the spring thaw took hold. However, downward pressure on ferrous prices the last two months of the quarter tightened ferrous metal spread. The scrap export market for ferrous material appears to be shaping up similarly to 2013 as year-to-date total export volumes through May are lower than recent historical volumes for the same period. Compounded in the domestic scrap market volatility is the continuing overcapacity of shredders. Non-ferrous metal spreads was the bright spot for our recycling segment and improved over first quarter largely due to higher metal spreads for copper and most particularly aluminum. Moving to fabrication, they also achieved record quarterly shipments. Our order book continues to strengthen and inquiries remain robust. According to Steel Joist Institute, domestic year-over-year joist shipments have increased 14% as of May 2014. Our joist shipments increased over 30%. The team is doing a phenomenal job, is increasing market share and successfully leveraging our national footprint. As mentioned in our press release, remaining operating trials were completed and a four-week outage was taken to upgrade the rotary hearth furnace during the second quarter at our Minnesota operations. As anticipated, these trials and the outage resulted in second quarter losses similar to those experienced in the first quarter. However, the trials resulted in very encouraging results related to the improvement in yield, quality, volume and raw material input costs resulting in a potential cost structure that we believe is competitive relative to anticipated long-term market pig iron pricing. We believe we can achieve a $340 to $350 per metric ton cash cost basis before the end of 2014. This assumes an operating rate of approximately 32,000 metric tons per month or 360,000 metric tons annually. Given the pig iron prices that historically range from approximately $380 to $550 per ton NOLA since January 2010, we believe the Minnesota process is a good hedge based both on secure supply as well as quality and cost. However, this cost structure must be confirmed on a consistent ongoing basis over the coming months. In the meantime, as the operations ramp back up, third quarter 2014 losses related to the company\u2019s Minnesota operations are expected to be meaningfully less than those incurred in the second quarter. Iron Dynamics operation produced 64,000 metric tons of liquid pig, slightly lower than the prior year first quarter, but the team continues to perform well. IDI is an integral contributor to the flat roll division\u2019s productivity and is also a great sustainability story. A 100% of their iron needs are obtained through recycling steel mill waste oxides. Regarding outlook and that we remain very optimistic. If you couple our organic growth projects and latent steel capacity with the planned acquisition of Columbus and our belief that steel consumption will continue to improve, we are foreseeing incredible growth for Steel Dynamics for our employees, customers and shareholders alike. Our resolve to maintain a differentiated growth company that effectively and efficiently performs through the cycle is unwavering. We believe our superior operating culture and the strength of our financial performance provides evidence of our successful business model regardless of the market environment. We recognize that we were in a relational business. Our focus on providing exceptional value to our customers, delivering the highest quality products when and where they are needed and actively engaging customers in discussions about their future needs are critical to our success. We believe Steel Dynamics is best positioned to capitalize on the phenomenal growth opportunities that lay ahead. The strong character and fortitude of our employees are unmatched. The dedication to customers and passion for excellence compel us to achieve highest standards of the performance. And I thank each and every one of them for their hard work and dedication and remind them that safety is the first priority always. Again, thank you for your time today folks. And Kevin, we would like to open the call for questions please. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Luke Folta from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Good morning, guys. Long time no talks. I guess first one I had was on SBQ, can you talk about of the new 325,000 tons of capacity that you have at Pittsboro, how much you are shipping from those operations now, the new line? Mark Millett : Hi, Luke. We have produced about 3,000 tons off of the new mill so far during our \u2013 just the last month or two of commissioning, because we really just put the sizing mill, put the last component to be commissioned and that was just here in the month of June and July. And so the dimensions are dialed in and the service quality has been dialed in and so now we look to ramp it up, but about 3,000 tons and we are looking to move that up a couple of thousand tons each month now. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Okay. And also there has been a couple of rounds of price increases for SBQ products this year, curious on your thoughts, so far have those price increases stuck and does that imply that if prices are kind of flat second half into 2015 that you could see price increases on the annual agreements into \u201815? Mark Millett : Well, a lot of ours agreements are contractual. And those we maintained spot business, we took that in the upward direction, but we honored all of our prior agreements. Needless to say, the alloys and so forth they are subject to surcharge mechanisms and those will move, but we took the general direction, but did not try to got out and run in a hard upward direction to alienate anyone. Some of our competitors have been having some problems and we have been the beneficiary of some of that business. We have our most solid booking, our strongest book for the next quarter ever. And I think we have been the beneficiary of our marketing philosophy and so we are very pleased with our position. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Nice. Okay. And then just on the target for Columbus for next year, there was some discussion around this on yesterday\u2019s call, but just maybe add some granularity, can you give us some sense of what the shipment expectation is or the utilization expectation is for your \u201815 outlook? I guess I am just trying to \u2013 and also can you just discuss I guess what the discrepancy is in profitability between Columbus and Butler and I know you talked about over time you expected those could close and perhaps even Columbus couldn\u2019t exceed that of Butler longer term, but just to get a sense of what that discrepancy is in your \u201815 outlook? Mark Millett : Yes. I think Luke in total, we are looking at shipments around about 3, 3.1 million tons next in 2015. That actually is not a great deal more than they are shipping today. But you have to take into account a shift into downstream value add and the associated yield loss there. So, I think 3, 3.1 is a pretty solid number, particularly as we anticipate the market is going to continue to improve. Relative to the differences in cost structure there, I think again several areas of improvement of synergy, you have just the conversion cost. I think when you combine the talent and expertise of Columbus with our team we are going to edge that down. We are certainly going to get a benefit from our diverse portfolio. Obviously, there is synergies between Butler and Columbus from a product standpoint and directing the right orders to the right place for the least amount of price. OmniSource will bring some benefit. We have the ability to increase its volume. We certainly have a huge appetite for scrap and everyone else is still going to have their supply capability, but we will be able to leverage OmniSource and bring perhaps a little more scrap in from the Southeast. And then New Millennium obviously is it can be a good source of value. And they have purchased \u2013 Chris, how much do you purchase from them last year? Chris Graham : Little over 60,000 and that was with one of our Southwest plants just in kind of a startup mode. Mark Millett : Yes. Chris Graham : This year we look to exceed 80,000. Mark Millett : Yes. Yes, but given the geographic location of the mill and proximity to us, Southeast and Southwest plants, we expect that volume could quite easily grow to 180,000. Chris Graham : Yes. Mark Millett : So, that gives you almost an immediate boost in utilization of the value-add downstream lines down there. And that\u2019s probably an area given better utilization and utilizing our knowledge in that arena we can certainly I think grow value. I think thirdly, we mentioned yesterday that there are legacy costs \u2013 legacy what I call contracts there. The way the mill is built originally, a lot of CapEx was distributed to the \u2013 or delegated to the service provider and it\u2019s kind of a shift of CapEx to an operating cost. And as those contracts unwind naturally over the next year or so, two years we believe we are going to get some synergy from that. And then finally just logistics, I think combination of OmniSource and a couple of other things that we are going on, we can I believe get scrap and raw materials down to the facility at a slightly less, again not massively less, but slightly improved cost. So if you add those all up, I think there is meaningful synergies, I think we have talked about $30 million yesterday, I think we also said about $10 million, Theresa or so is going to be in the very near future and the other 20 will come on over the next year or two. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Okay. And just for clarification the 2.1 that\u2019s a short turn? Mark Millett : Yes. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Okay. And then just as that compares to Butler should we be thinking of like 110, 120 per ton is kind of normalized Butler number? Mark Millett : 110, 120 I don\u2019t think good try, but I don\u2019t think we have necessarily given that number out. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Okay. Theresa Wagler : Tried. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Last one Theresa, what\u2019s the diluted share count and interest expense going to be now with the convert retirement just to square that up? Theresa Wagler : Sure. So the share is actually for the third quarter had come down slightly because not all of the notes converted. So I would say probably like $240.2 million is probably a good number to you. And for interest expense I would say probably somewhere around $27 million, $28 million per quarter. Luke Folta - Jefferies: Okay. Alright. Thank you and congrats again. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brett Levy from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy - Jefferies: Hey guys. Can you talk about earlier you said the order books are stronger, can you sort of talk about how far they go out in sort of each of the relevant product areas? Mark Millett : I think the sheet mill is very, very strong. Obviously, yes there are some upper price \u2013 upward price momentum just recently. I think on the hot-rolled band side of things we are probably we are into\u2026 Dick Teets : Look we don\u2019t know our policies, we don\u2019t open our books in flat rolled except like a month out for the Hot Band and a little bit further for our coated products and that\u2019s our standard because we really do play in the spot market. So we are and that\u2019s why we got a little bit of notoriety here recently in the press when we sent note to our customers to say we were full because that was in the close order. Brett Levy - Jefferies: So that four weeks or so for Hot Band and\u2026 Dick Teets : And six to eight weeks for our coated products and that\u2019s as they are basically for across the board. Our structural and rail has a good backlog, solid for July probably three quarters of August, but we always expect to pick up the orders as we go through the rollings and so August is not an issue. And I know that we have orders in rails so forth already passed that. We are looking at only quarter-to-quarter and don\u2019t open up the final quarter, yet at all-in the structural and rail yet, even someone who placed an order we don\u2019t see it on our logs. As far as I mentioned SBQ, we have the strongest backlog right now than we have had in years and actually the strongest book in the month ever. And so that\u2019s very heartening. Probably the weakest place we have, excuse me is at Roanoke but strongest in the most recent past because we are back to rolling mill full time as we were taking two days a month out, but we are rolling merchant bar and shapes. And so I am pleased to say that strengthened and Steel West Virginia, this past week we have been rolling full and there is a little bit of a weakness possible, but we are not concerned about it. It\u2019s going to be a very solid year at Steel West Virginia. Brett Levy - Jefferies: Yes. Dick Teets : And I think and The Techs because we are working in a flat roll, the sales is working as a team. Again MetalTech is the strongest book we had quite in quite a while. I mean the most difficult place I would tell you is the NexTech which is the very light gauge in our products and that was under attack from China and India and so forth. And now it will be open and (indiscernible) trade cases behind us, we are gathering data and want to deal with it as we keep it along with our competitors and that\u2019s to be done. Mark Millett : So, it\u2019s on the steel side \u2013 thanks you, very, very solid. I think additionally though our optimism comes from the \u2013 where we see the improvement in the construction arena. So Chris can you give us a little insight as to your non-residential construction move? Dick Teets : Yes Mark, we \u2013 quote activity remained strong. We had mentioned in the past call or two that the Southeast was lagging a bit. We are pleased to see that the Southeast activity is picking up at a nice pace. Bookings remained strong and our joist and deck backlogs currently are at record levels. The joist industry bookings are on pace to exceed 950,000 tons for 2014, that would represent the biggest year by far since 2008. And the team is capitalizing on these new opportunities, stands prepared to handle even higher levels. The activity going forward, we find strength and been able to move work around our national footprint. And so the team is ready to go. They have done a good job. Mark Millet : The earnings for the second quarter were pretty good too. Dick Teets : Well, we don\u2019t, yes we got work to do, but it\u2019s all improving. Brett Levy - Jefferies: Okay. And then you guys mentioned on yesterday\u2019s call that you potentially look at Galvalume were offered for sale kind of fits your footprint kind of down the middle of the country. Would you guys be committed to keeping the same sort of conservative debt to equity ratio as if you were to look at that transaction as well? Theresa Wagler : From the financial perspective, we are very much committed to again growth, but if growth gets us outside of our metrics of preference which we really do look at is net leverage three times or less. We will do it as long as within an 18 to 24 months period, we are able to get back into that alignment. So I think, yes we still are committed to that. Brett Levy - Jefferies: And then, the last ones sort of the acute question, $16 million of the converts were just matured, would it have been possible to like buy them back and then convert them, or I mean it seems like somehow money was left on the table there by somebody? Theresa Wagler : Money was left on the table by them, yes. And no, it wasn\u2019t at our option. So we had to pay them in cash. Brett Levy - Jefferies: Got it. Thanks very much. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Mark Millett : Thanks Brett. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Murphy from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Matt Murphy - UBS: Good morning. I am just wondering for a bit more color on Minnesota operations and where you\u2019re targeting about, a need to confirm the cost structure, I guess trying to get a sense of how well do you understand the process rate now, has there been sort of in these trials, has there been sort of a clear outcome and you just want to run with that for a while, so just a bit more color there? Thanks. Mark Millet : Well, I am not sure I can articulate it any better than you just did that the trials were very indicative. It showed us a combination. Theresa used the analogy that we know the ingredients and had to bake the cake, we would just go do it each and everyday. I think the startup \u2013 and again we started back up at the end of June, but July month-to-date we are running at around about 95% availability and a little over actually it was 340,000 ton annualized run rate. So the volume I think is we are very comfortable with the 360 or perhaps even more run rate. The year improvements and the raw material input changes all point to a cost structure as I mentioned in that 340, 350 range and it\u2019s just a matter of doing it month in month out and so we\u2019ll see what that yields appear in the next month or two. Matt Murphy - UBS: And you said a significant change in the degree of loss in Q3 I guess is there any scenario you would look at where you would actually not be loss making there in the near future? Mark Millet : Well Q3, we wouldn\u2019t get to a non loss posture in Q3 and on a pre-tax basis probably not the fourth quarter. The financial profile will be meaningfully improved. Matt Murphy - UBS: Okay thanks a lot. Mark Millet : Expected at least to be meaningfully improved. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tony Rizzuto from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : Thank you very much congrats on the acquisition and all the progress across the company? Mark Millet : Thank you. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : It appears as there is use potential alone at product mix shift at Columbus and I just wanted to pursue that a little bit more I think in 2013 hot-rolled comprised about 70% of the overall shipments there can you provide some guidance as to where you guys expect that mix to be say two years down the road hot-rolled cold-rolled and coated? Mark Millet : I am not sure I have actually booked it from a percentage basis. Dick Teets : No, but I think just in general just like above we pull it down to close to the 45% to 50% high band no don\u2019t really shift much people on oil because they run their mill and they don\u2019t have a disconnect for the people line there. Now they push full, kept the line but it only runs one or two turns a week which is \u2013 I am going to say tragic but an asset has been totally underutilized and then from a galvanized standpoint we recognize that annual basis to and so I\u2019m not trying to criticize and then but that\u2019s where we look to push the tons through and get the value there. And so therefore that will pull those Hot Band tons down and we need to get the tons through the mill and down through the - Hot Band galvanized or cold-rolled galvanized. And it will become more over balanced like Butler I would believe. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : This is actually\u2026 Dick Teets : Obviously but as we mentioned yesterday, the capture is much thick of diameter we have the ability, heavier gauges, wider widths and the team there is already working on developing and evolving to the X70, grade energy scale which carries a good premium. So I think there is continued focus there. They are having some success with some of the dual phase steels, again good premium for those and that will be our focus also. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : Can you guys give me an idea of what the approximate cost would be going from hot-rolled to cold-rolled and to coated? Mark Millet : Again, the time we don\u2019t really give our conversion cost out. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : Okay. I have got a question on dual CTG market if I may, of the hot-rolled coil at Columbus that\u2019s going to tubers currently. Is it fair to say that this is the more basic low carbon alloys substrate and could you give us an idea of what price level the tubers may be selling this product for at present the ERW product? Mark Millet : Mostly the focus at Columbus is not necessarily, and correct me if I am wrong, but it\u2019s not been the focus to supply just absolute basic carbon ERW. They are supplying the X40, X50 today, X60. Dick Teets : And there is a whole range, they do quite a nice job of supplying quite a few different tubers and full complement of \u2013 across the board. So and what they sell for, I \u2013 what the tuber sell for, I can\u2019t tell you. I have no idea. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : Alright, no problem. And then finally just a question guys on the overall domestic flat roll market and I wonder, do you feel that the supply, demand improvement may be partly related to the lack of CapEx in 2009 and 2010 timeframe principally by the integrated players and the effect that this may be having somewhat on the equipment uptime or operational stability, how do you guys feel about that? Mark Millet : Well obviously they've had over the last 12 months a few outages here and there, to be honest, I'm not so sure where folks do not know whether it\u2019s regular maintenance or sort of monies that they haven't spent over the last two, three years. So, I don\u2019t think we can comment on that time. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen and Company : I always respect your views though Mark on that because you obviously \u2013 you have some great vision into that but I appreciate any comments you can make on that? Thank you. Mark Millet : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Hello, good morning guys. Mark Millet : Good morning. Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, I wanted to ask a little bit about the margin in the second quarter. So, prices fell what in average of about two bucks and scraps off 16 bucks which is a bit unusual, you also had the problems with some of the integrated peers and production, you just mentioned some of your SBQ peers had some problems producing so I guess I just wanted some thoughts on how sustainable second quarter margins might be in light of those elements? Mark Millet : I think as we see the market today, most of our revenues is stable to positive from a pricing standpoint. And I think the potential and we don\u2019t really like to prophesize as to where the scrap market is going but given the export market is not incredibly strong and flows are good we expect scrap at least in the near term to be kind of side ways to edge down may be a few bucks. So, I think the current environment is probably sustainable. Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, this \u2013 even if the production comes back from some of your peers on those products we just discussed, it can continue to see the differential between scrap and steel where it's been you're seeing? Mark Millet : I think SDI at least will not be impacted by that. Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And just switching gears, I just want to make sure I understand on Mesabi, I think I missed the number that you gave for you cost structure going forward and can you also just provide I'm still sorry it's not really clear on what its going to take to get to a more advantageous position and sorry if I am being dense but I'm just not really clear on what's improved, if you could give us a little more detail there? Mark Millet : Yes. The number, the range I gave was the cash cost basis of $340 to $350 per metric ton. And again \u2013 it's a matter of executing on the results that we saw in the prior trials earlier this year. Timna Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, maybe I will follow up later on. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Evan Kurtz from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : Hi good morning guys. Mark Millet : Good morning. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : So, maybe just a follow-up and it sounds like here in the 3Q, are you looking for scrap to be sideways to down, pricing is certainly stable, may be moving up a little bit right now. Are there any sort of offsets to that or should we expect to see some improving margins in the third quarter? Mark Millet : I think I\u2019ve already opened our crystal ball as far as we invite the (indiscernible). Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : Okay. I will probably give it a try. Maybe moving on then to Columbia City, how much upside is left on the long product side. I know you had a pretty strong quarter but it seems like there is still quite a bit of availability at that plant and as the non-res recovery unfolds, may be if you could just provide some color on where do you see upside as beam volumes improve and perhaps beam margins improve, I know back in 2007 beam margins are better than rail margins, do you think we can get back to a time and place like we were back then? Mark Millet : I will say that Columbus City does have the opportunity to continue to move up in volume that goes to say they, number one mill, the rigs on heavy section mill is fully loaded and with rail and heavier section productions. We have recently added a third crew on to the medium section mill and now that they\u2019ve trained and operating the sales force is out trying to fill up that shifts. And so there is the opportunity is there. And again it\u2019s lighter section, so you need to see you are ending up selling time under mill because it turns a lot of linear feet and from a margin perspective I think the industry has done well with the support from the customers and so forth. Imports have recently backed off a little bit and so we have cleaned up I think our discounts that were floating around out there and now I think we\u2019re back to nice pricing and there is a may be an underpinning of may be some upward movements so it depends on scraps. So I think the opportunity is at Columbia City out of all our mills and so our sales force is out working their tails off. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : I can you tell us I am sorry? Mark Millett : On brands of basis if you think I don\u2019t think you see we shift the record level at 6.1 million tons last year and excluding Columbus for a moment we have about 7.8 million ton shipping capability. So we have about 1.5 million tons of what I consider late and value or volume that we\u2019ve never had a steel consuming economy to exploit. So that I think considerable upside to us. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : And what sort of operating range was going to be you said in the last quarter? Chris Graham : I never calculated it again the heavy section mill is four, and so they shipped record rate of about 117,000 production. Mark Millett : We will get for you as we take another question. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Great. Maybe just last question and I referred a lot in that trade press about the potential flat rolled trade case and cold-rolled and perhaps some one could apprise as well, any thoughts on when we might see that as it close? Mark Millett : I will just say again I can\u2019t speak everyone now I know is that we continue to be distressed by the amount of inputs that are out there both by light gauge rolled and Galvalume and other coated and paint products and so I think we are out gathering data and looking at our own results. And so, we talked our trade attorneys and they are out there having discussions. So I first spend to be a sooner rather than later. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : Great, thanks guys. Theresa Wagler : On the utilization perspective the structural metal division operated around 75% range in the second quarter. Evan Kurtz - Morgan Stanley : Okay. It\u2019s been helpful. Thanks guys. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Gambardella from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Yes, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Question on the potential for the integration between Butler and Columbus currently how much of an overlap those two mills have in terms of regional competition and is there quite a bit of potential to really shorten up your markets or tight up your market may be Butler doesn't have to go as far South and Columbus doesn\u2019t have to go as far North. And what\u2019s the potential for that and also how are you going to handle the integration in terms of making sure that the mills aren\u2019t competing against each other? Mark Millett : I think the \u2013 again the purchase has been fully based on where we think we can drive it from the cost perspective and mix shift. If you look at the geographies it is a or there a Southern Mill; I would say versus the Midwest Northern mill. So there's very little overlap to say geographically and then also from a product perspective, a little overlap yes there is I think Dick articulated. They are heavily into the energy pipe markets today, 45% to 50% output whereas Butler is I think these are 10%, 15 percentage is that \u2013 Butler is 30, we estimate about 30% \u2013 32% automotive. Unexposed automotive, but still automotive where I believe Columbus currently is about 5%. So there's a very large sort of dislocation in both geographic and product overlap. Okay billets \u2013 and again until we closed with \u2013 we\u2019ve announced to push this agreement, but until we close, we were full competitors, so. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Right, sure. Another question, just on the non-res construction demand, have you seen any additional improvement sequentially in the last quarter? Chris Graham : Yes, this is Chris. I was just looking at six week trends versus 13, 26, 52. We have seen increase from our 52 week average to our 13-week average of probably 30%, 30% to 40%. And so we continue to see signs of increased strength. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: And then down to the six-week? Chris Graham : Six week is, that\u2019s where we start to talk about how far our crystal ball works and the six week averages are as high as they have been, six and 13 right on top each other which are marked improvements over last point 6 and 52 and so as far as we can see the strength continues. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Millett : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Sal Tharani from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : Good morning, Mark. Mark Millett : Good morning, Sal. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : I wanted to ask you a question, yesterday you made a remark that since the new management of Severstal has come in there has been quite a bit of change in terms of profitability of the company and last six months have been pretty good, you heard similar remarks from AK Steel, I was wondering, you know I mean I am sure when new management came in selling of the plant was probably on the table immediately and I was just wondering that how much of this, and these are big ships who turned around that quickly and I am just wondering their due diligence are you comfortable that all these measures they have taken which have improved profitability over the last six months are sustainable, there is not little bit of window dressing in there, and have you done quite a bit of diligence on that? Mark Millett : I think we have done more due diligence on this project than anything we have done before by far and we brought in the OmniSource recycling team and they have done a great job looking at the logistics of getting scrap to the mill where the scrap draw regions will be and have been. We see that the changes that the team has made are definitely sustainable, there is no doubt about it. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thanks. So I have another question on the metal recycling and ferrous resources operations to report, so if I look at your OmniSource operating income and even if I subtract the, or add or just for the realized or unrealized hedging losses or gain. I come up with a number per ton which is \u2013 much better than what we see at other scrap companies or other steel companies which are on scrap so that\u2019s pretty good and kudos to your OmniSource team that put on profitability has been pretty good compared to others. But when I do the math and I look at your at $18 million plus worth of operating income in OmniSource and take the unrealized hedging lost out and then if I subtract your loss from the Minnesota iron producing asset 9.1 million post tax or may be 14 with a pre-tax, it still leaves me a gap of $3 million of loss was that at IDI or is that something I am missing in here? Theresa Wagler : No, and Sal we can go offline with this if you would like the number that you are looking at for Minnesota is actually a net of tax it\u2019s not pre-tax and it\u2019s not the operating level. So the number that you\u2019re looking at for Metals Recycling and double segment is operating and the number that we give for Minnesota is not. So there is bridge to do and I am happy to do that with you offline. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : Okay. We will do that. Thank you very much. Theresa Wagler : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Lane from Morningstar Inc. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc.: Hi good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc.: A couple questions here, first you mentioned that the purchase of the Columbus facility will provide with access to the Mexican steel market, I am curious as to what portion of Columbus\u2019 sales are currently derived from Mexico. And then kind of along those lines are there already significant business relationships in place or is this more of a growth opportunity that will come from low base? Mark Millett : I think it\u2019s the latter it\u2019s a very large growth opportunity coming from a low base. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc.: Okay, are you willing to share it? Mark Millett : Fortunately, we have existing customer relationships that have assets in Monterry in particular currently and I would certainly think that as I trusted loyal relationships, I think we can expand on those and create commercial opportunity for the Columbus mill. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc.: Okay. And then could you provide some colors for just the broader big picture strategy for addressing the Mexican steel market. It didn\u2019t really hear what product types might constitute your key exports and what end markets might predominantly fuel growth in the region for you? Mark Millett : I think the, well the right answer is we haven\u2019t explored and got an absolute precise strategy in place. But given the relationships we\u2019ve had the items would cover total sheet, total valves and Hot Band, yes. Dick Teets : There is a lot of industries that are growing down I need to say are appliance, automotive and energy. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: The contract at service piece you mentioned I think it was $10 million to $15 million annualized that you expect to wind down over the course of the next couple of years. Is that right now in the operating expenses of Columbus is that what you were saying? Theresa Wagler : No, it\u2019s actually capitalized to CapEx. Typically these services would be part of our operating expense for Columbus it actually comes across as capital investment. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So are we seeing that 10 million to 15 million then when it\u2019s transferred over to your P&L, we should see that as operating expense on, is that what you are trying to convey? Theresa Wagler : Not necessarily, Phil, because again we are looking at what we believe operating rates and things might be going forward, these are some of the contacts that Mark talked earlier that we might be able to renegotiate at some point in time, but so it\u2019s a little \u2013 it\u2019s less clear than that. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I was just trying to decide for whether your EBITDA thought process included headwind from those contract services or was included in your CapEx assumptions? Theresa Wagler : It\u2019s currently included in our CapEx assumption. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Mark Millett : But just a little clear and we are on the same page. Theresa mentioned that there was CapEx of 25 plus $10 million $15 million of contracted service, al right. That is a little different than the legacy contract services that I was alluding to whereby the service providers that showed some of the CapEx which and those contracts are going to unwind over the next couple of years. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate that. And Theresa, can you provide the mix of flat roll products in the quarter as you typically do? Theresa Wagler : Sure, Phil, I am sorry. Okay, so for the flat roll division second quarter shipments hot roll shipments were 358,000 tons, P&L 91,000 tons, cold rolled 47,000 tons, hot-roll galvanized, 128,000 tons. Cold-rolled galvanized 42,000 tons. Painted products were 101,000 tons and finally Galvalume was 11,000 tons. Phil Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Mark Millett : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nathan Littlewood from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse : Good morning, guys. Congrats again and thanks for the opportunity. I just had a question falling upon yesterday and I apologize if I missed it amongst all that was going on but Theresa, you are kind enough to sort of breakout your estimate for next year\u2019s EBITDA for this Columbus mill. Now, clearly that has lot of the same sort of macro and commodity price drivers as your existing steel fabrication business. I was wondering if you might be able to help us sort of close the gap between 260 mill at Columbus and what the equivalent number would be for your existing steel fabrication business as we can see it today? Theresa Wagler : Couple of things. First of all, yesterday we didn't confirm what we thought EBITDA would be for the Columbus mill. What we did was, we talked around a multiple that was given during the presentation, but secondly I think more importantly our steel fabrication business is not related to the Columbus mill, the steel fabrication is really producing joist and decking and we have some more facility on our flat roll division but it is very similar to Columbus but not our steel fabrication operation. Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse : So, when you look at this, okay they are different products. So when you look at the general sort of macro environment, scrap prices, demand all that sort of stuff, these things are all incredibly correlated and when in fact you look at the historic correlation between Severstal\u2019s North American earnings and your own earnings or AK Steel\u2019s earnings again they were very highly co-related. So in an environment where Columbus can do 260 about what sort of ballpark range would you think the existing business is doing? Theresa Wagler : You are looking for us to give an estimate for Steel Dynamics for 2015 EBITDA, yes we\u2026.. Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse : Correct. Theresa Wagler : Won\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t believe in giving guidance out that far. So I am sorry I cannot help you with that. Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse : Okay, no problem. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for the final and closing comments. Mark Millett - President and Chief Executive Officer : Super. Thanks, Kevin and thank you for all those still on the call listening. I would like to thank you for your support, online support for our company and to our customers. Thank you, your loyal support also and to \u2013 our employees, keep up the great work and be safe each and everyday guys and girls. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Once again ladies and gentleman this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Millett: Well, thank you, Marlene, and good morning, everybody. We hope you -- hopefully, you're having a good fall. We certainly appreciate you taking the time to join us today to discuss our third quarter results, which we believe are pretty terrific, under the circumstances, and to share with you exciting opportunities ahead for Steel Dynamics. Once again, a full-hearted SDI welcome to our new Columbus employees. As the new private owner of Columbus Mississippi Flat Roll mill, we are pleased with the progress of integration. I had the opportunity actually to attend the company picnic this past weekend, and it gave me an opportunity -- a chance to meet a lot of our employees and their families and their kids. And I've got to tell you, they were a phenomenal group of people, and they're going to fit in perfectly with the SDI family. The teams themselves, integration teams, are doing a phenomenal job. The acquisition represents a transformational step in the continuation of our growth strategy and allows us to leverage our core strengths. It's meaningful to our business and delivers significant additional value to all our stakeholders. In short, the Columbus addition brings us significant growth and exceptional financial returns, all while maintaining a good credit profile, with the capacity for additional investment opportunity. In addition to closing the acquisition mid-month, our existing SDI operations saw meaningful growth and profitability during the third quarter. The results are indicative of the strength of our business model and our culture. Those are significantly important for maintaining our best-in-class performance. I'd like to turn the call over to Theresa for comments about our financial results this quarter, and then I'll follow with additional market commentary and where I see both near- and longer-term additional growth and performance opportunities. So Theresa? Theresa E. Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. We're quite pleased with our third quarter operating and financial results. Third quarter 2014 net income was $91 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, including the negative impact of $0.09 per diluted share related to Columbus acquisition costs, financing fees and purchase accounting adjustments. Excluding these charges of approximately $40 million, third quarter diluted earnings per share would have been $0.47, above the upper range of our adjusted guidance of between $0.42 and $0.46 for the quarter. The acquisition and financing costs are reflected in our income statement as other expense. You'll notice the elevated model. The purchase accounting adjustments reflect our initial purchase price allocation estimates, which resulted in a preliminary step-up of inventory and fixed asset values. The associated negative impact of approximately $14.5 million from additional depreciation and margin reduction are reflected as an increase to our cost of goods sold. Based on our early estimates, it appears that our purchase price is very close to the book value of the assets. The operational results for Columbus are included in our results as of the acquisition closing date of September 16, 2014, basically about 15 days. Our third quarter net sales of $2.3 billion were 13% higher than the second quarter of this year and 22% higher than the prior year third quarter. The improvement in earnings is driven by increased margins based on both metal spread expansion and volume-related cost compression. Third quarter operating income was $189 million, an increase of 43% compared to the second quarter. Regarding our steel operations, record quarterly shipments were achieved again in the third quarter, and metal spread expanded across the business. Scrap raw material prices decreased, as overall average steel product pricing improved $7 per ton. Quarter-over-quarter pricing improvements were more pronounced in our Flat Roll and Structural Divisions. Total shipments increased 13% over the second quarter, hitting a quarterly record 1.9 million tons, driven by improved long product shipments. We even would've achieved record volumes without the 175,000 tons of shipment from Columbus. These operating results led to operating income from our steel operations of $202 million, or $110 per ton shipped, an increase of 28% compared to the second quarter. Excluding the Columbus purchase accounting adjustments, operating income would've improved 37%. Metals Recycling continued to be in a challenging environment. Shipments improved and ferrous metal spread remained relatively steady. However, nonferrous metal spread contracted over 20%, primarily due to falling copper prices. From July 3 to the end of the quarter, copper pricing reported on COMEX fell over 14%. Third quarter 2014 operating income decreased $5 million compared to the second quarter. Ferrous shipments increased 2% and nonferrous shipments increased 13% based on improved copper and aluminum volume. Moving on, our fabrication operations continue to shine. The third quarter 2014 benefited from another record quarterly shipment level of 144,000 tons, surpassing second quarter's record by 37%. Increasing volumes continue to compress costs, and both margins and market share continue to expand. During the quarter, increased average product pricing achieved higher raw material steel pricing, expanding profitability. Additionally, volume is a powerful influence for our fabrication operations. It allows the team to fully lever the technology and performance-based incentive system, resulting in a dramatic compression of conversion costs. Third quarter 2014 operating income increased to $19 million, more than doubling second quarter's performance. We continue to see improvements in the underlying nonresidential demand, good news all around. During the third quarter 2014, we generated $249 million of cash from operations, compared to $76 million in the second quarter of this year. Working capital reductions contributed $86 million to the quarter. Year-to-date working capital has increased $102 million, excluding the Columbus acquisition. This is really related to accounts receivable. The key drivers are positive factors based on the demand environment and our organic growth ramp, which are increasing aggregate customer account balances. However, while the quantity of our receivables have increased, the quality has not deteriorated, and days outstanding, along with our aged accounts, are in good stead. Regarding our capital structure, we funded the Columbus acquisition through the issuance of $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes. The remainder of the $1.6 billion purchase price was paid through a combination of available cash and borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Rick and the team did a great job and accessed the high-yield bond market at an opportune time, raising $1.2 billion at an attractive long-term average interest rate of 5.3%. Although our debt maturity -- excuse me, additionally, our debt maturity outlook is incredibly flexible. We don't have any near-term meaningful maturities, yet our callability profile allows for prepayment if warranted. Even with our recent acquisition, our liquidity and credit metrics remain strong. At September 30, our liquidity totaled $1.2 billion. This includes available cash of $160 million and available funding under our revolving credit facility of $1 billion. We had outstanding borrowings on our revolver of $60 million at the end of the quarter. However, we've since repaid that outstanding balance, and we again have our full revolver available at $1.1 billion. Our total debt was $3.1 billion, with minimal secured borrowings, less than 10% after repaying the revolver. Our net debt was $2.9 billion, with trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $1.048 billion. That includes pro forma historical Columbus EBITDA. This results in net debt to trailing adjusted EBITDA of 2.8x. So on a pro forma basis, we're already back in line with our preferred through cycle net leverage of less than 3x, a great accomplishment. Looking ahead, we believe that our capital structure and credit profile have the flexibility to both sustain current operations and to support additional growth investments. Thank you. Mark? Mark D. Millett: Super. Thanks, Theresa. Well, once again, safety is first for us. It's the absolute highest priority for me, for each employee and our families, and simply said, our goal is to work each day incident-free. Even though our performance is better than industry averages, I know there is more work to be done, and we are moving in that direction. Toward that goal, 85 out of our 121 locations achieved 0 recordable incidents during the quarter, third quarter. Many of these locations haven't incurred a single incident this year, so my personal congratulations and thanks to those specific teams for demonstrating that our goal to reach 0 accidents is both achievable and sustainable over the longer term. Turning to business. I think understandably, recent geopolitical events, coupled with concerns regarding stalled international growth, have decreased consumer optimism and wreaked havoc on the equity markets. However, the strength of our third quarter financial performance, recent conversations with our customers and the current profile of our order books do not reflect a structural shift from the continued positive growth we have seen all year. Durable goods and nonresidential construction, 2 components of the non-services GDP, accounted for roughly 47% of the improvement in overall GDP in the second quarter. This supports our view that non-service-related GDP continues to be an important contributor to our overall domestic economy, which is good for steel consumption. Although consumer spending decreased slightly exiting third quarter, sales of our steel-consuming products such as appliances increased. Forecast for key steel-consuming end markets remain positive. Automotive continues to be strong at 16.5 million units, growing to almost 18 million over the next few years. Overall construction spending continues to trend favorably, increasing 5% through August as compared to the same period in 2013, while nonresidential construction increased 6%. Additionally, growth in the domestic shale arena continues to require infrastructure investment, which we believe will positively affect demand for steel. Recent concerns regarding stalled growth in international markets have caused large energy companies to redirect their investments to North America, so midstream to end stream investments will be required to support projects stemming from that redirected capital. Our steel operations delivered another strong quarter both financially and operationally. They shipped a record 1.9 million tons, and I believe it's worth emphasizing that our pre-existing steelmaking facilities surpassed our prior record even without the inclusion of the Columbus volumes. Our Structural Rail and Engineered Bar Divisions each achieved record quarterly shipments. Although the majority of the volume increase stemmed from structural products and special bar quality steel shipments, we also increased rail shipments by 12%. We continue to make considerable progress with the Class I railroads through the qualification process for our premium rail, which we began producing early this year. We're already qualified with 5 of the 7 Class I customers. Our quality and customer service standards are receiving exemplary commentary. This product addition positions us to become the preeminent rail supplier in North America. Currently, we're the only North American manufacturer that welds quarter-mile length strings, using 320-foot rail versus the conventional 80-foot rail. This is a strong competitive advantage. It reduces the rail's foot string by more than 75%, a significant advantage for our customers, as it dramatically reduces the potential for railment [ph] failures, there's an obvious safety benefit for them, as well as reducing track maintenance costs. We believe domestic rail consumption will continue to increase during the next 3 to 5 years, as both replacement and new rail are acquired, as suggested by railroad investment forecasts, driven in large part by the U.S. Energy Sector. We plan to increase our rail shipments in parallel with this growth and have told our rail customers that we are committed to this market, and will supply up to 350,000 tons annually to meet their needs, which enhances our profitability through both product margin expansion and provides cost compression through increased volume. We shipped just over 200,000 tons of standard rail in 2013. We expect to increase that amount by 10% or more this year, with further improvements in both volume and mix in 2015. Our Engineered Bar capacity and product offering expansion is also progressing well. We've commissioned over 75% of the entire new smaller size range, and we're receiving positive customer feedback. We've been balancing commissioning with providing our customers the on-time delivery that they've come to expect from us, and we certainly appreciate their support during this time frame. We are confident that our trusted customer relationships built on quality and on-time delivery will allow us to increase our market share to fully utilize the added 325,000 tons of annualized rate in the coming year. The annual domestic SBQ market is generally between 8 million and 10 million tons, and of that, the 3, 5/8 [ph], or smaller diameter bars, which is the area of our expansion, represents about 55% of that, so we don't believe our market share expectations are unreasonable. We shipped 480,000 tons from Engineered Bar division in 2013. We expect to increase that amount by 30% in 2014, with obvious further improvements in both volume and product mix in 2015. From the closing date of September 16 to the end of the month, our shipments include 175,000 tons contributed by Columbus. Acquiring the Columbus mill was an incredible opportunity for Steel Dynamics, creating a single Flat Roll group, which provides us a platform to fully utilize our core competencies. It allows us to develop stronger relationships with our existing and new customers, maximizing logistical benefits to create further value for them; broadens our steel sheet product capabilities through width, gauge and strength diversity; complements on our current product portfolio with further exposure in the growth areas of energy and automotive; and it fully diversifies us geographically into the high-growth Southern U.S. and Mexican regions; leveraging synergies across 2 highly efficient flat-rolled steel mills and 8 coating lines provides us a unique opportunity to significantly increase value for all our stakeholders. Collectively, production utilization for our steel operations was 90% in the third quarter, compared to 95% last year. However, the rate though is not a reflection of decreased demand but rather it's a function of increased capacity from our SBQ expansion, the 350,000 tons or so, adding to the denominator, obviously, and a 4-day scheduled outage at the Butler Flat Roll mill. Excluding the impact from these items, utilization would've been slightly above the second quarter. There obviously remains general concern regarding the recent level of steel imports and associated headwinds to pricing and industry utilization. While we obviously monitor the activity closely, we continue to see relative strength in our order backlogs. We've had 2 consecutive quarters of record shipments. Part of our strategy is to not only develop the strong customer relationships, but to also manufacture market niche products that are more difficult to compete with on a global basis, such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ steels and longer-length rail. This helps us insulate us somewhat from the import threat. We believe the current growth expectations in both Europe and China, combined with global production overcapacity, will be a headwind to steel pricing for the foreseeable future, but I continue to believe that historic levels of imports as a percentage of domestic consumption will return, and that we will not see an import consequence on a sustained long-term basis. We continue to understand the design and dynamics of a competitive market as long as it's fair and equitable. As an American steel producer, we must remain vigilant, and our administration must enforce world trade laws in order for all of us to compete on a level playing field. In Metals Recycling business, we continue to work through another challenging quarter, reporting lower profitability. Both ferrous volume and nonferrous volumes improved, notably in copper and aluminum. However, ferrous metal spread was flat quarter-over-quarter, as decreased selling values were somewhat offset by cost compression from the volume improvement. Nonferrous metals spread was negatively impacted by weaker copper and nickel commodity markets, resulting in decreased profitability for our nonferrous segment. Year-to-date, July 1 scrap exports were 19% lower than the same period 2013, and both years being significantly lower than recent historical norms. The continued significant overcapacity of shredders, particularly in the Southeast and U.S., continues to compound volatility and continues to constrain margin, as processes are all competing for the same material. Regarding our Minnesota operations, as discussed on last quarter's call, we plan to ramp up volume while improving yield, quality and cost on a consistent basis during the third quarter. I'm pleased to report that our team achieved all of those things, and we expect further improvement in these areas as we continue to operate and make some enhancements to the iron ore retrieval process. We will be installing equipment that Magnetation has already utilized in other operations to bring our cost structure for iron concentrate back to the levels established in 2013 of under $50 per metric ton. Lately, the cost has been elevated higher than that due to lower yield recovery emanating from finer size tailings that we found in the current basin. Had we been at that cost level during the third quarter, our net losses would've been reduced from $5 million to just less than $3 million. We still hold the view that these operations have the potential to achieve a $340 to $350 per metric ton cash prices, but in order to do this, volumes must reach about 32,000 metric tons per month, or a 360,000 metric ton annualized rate. During the third quarter, our average monthly production rate was just over 27,500 metric tons per month, a significant improvement over months past, and a solid footing to ramp-up to the required volume. Our Fabrication Operations also achieved another quarterly shipment record, for both joist and deck products. The team is certainly positioned at that sector incredibly well for the returning construction markets. Industry utilization continues to improve, and it's certainly true for us. Based on sustainable increased demand and market share improvement, we have added production shifts at several of our plants, employing additional people in our communities. According to the Steel Joist Institute, as of August, year-over-year domestic joist shipments have increased 21%. Our joist shipments have increased over 35%. The team continues, as I say, to perform exceedingly well, both in market share advancement and leveraging our national footprint. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we are focusing on opportunities to maximize our financial performance. We're focused on providing exceptional value to our customers, committing to the highest levels of quality and timeliness, partnering with them to deliver what they need today and anticipating what they'll need for tomorrow. As we look ahead, we're optimistic concerning the industry and even more so for Steel Dynamics. Columbus is one aspect of our story, and our organic growth projects that are beginning to benefit our operations now and others. We have great leverage to recovering construction markets and are fully equipped to take advantage of new opportunities that lay ahead. Our resolve to maintain a differentiated growth company that effectively and efficiently perform through all market environments is unwavering. We believe our superior operating and financial performance clearly demonstrates the sustainability of our business model throughout the market cycle. The strong character and fortitude of our employees are unmatched. Their dedication to customers and passion for excellence compel us to achieve high standards of performance. I thank each and every one of them for their hard work and dedication, and remind them, safety is always the first priority. Again, thank you, everyone, for your time today. And Manny, we'd like to open up the call for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Luke Folta of Jefferies. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : A number of questions. So first question, I guess, during the past, you've been able to kind of go around the horn and give us some color in terms of what the order book looks like across the divisions. How are things comparing now versus sort of the way you exited the third quarter? Mark D. Millett: Well, let me take a quick shot, and Dick, I'm sure will -- can chime in. But just looking across our steel platform, Structural Rail division, continuing to see a steady growth in structural, structural beams, and I think the team has done a good job increasing market share there. We experienced a growth of about 16% compared to year-over-year market growth of 6%, 7% or so. And as I said, premium rail product continues to be well received. We likely shipped 40,000, 50,000 tons of premium rail this year, Dick, I think, yes? Richard P. Teets: Yes. Mark D. Millett: Which obviously adds to our value-added product mix there, and I think that -- the rail arena is shifting to a more premium rail sort of percentage of the market, and so we're in good position there to capture some of that. I think the nonresidential markets remain strong, as indicated by the uptick in the MSCI structural shipment data and recent construction starts. And I think nonresidential strength is also evident from occupations, New Millennium inquiry booking rate. That's seen a little seasonal adjustment, but still remains very, very strong. So I would say Structural Rail is still continuing to build momentum, and the order book is very solid. The Engineered Bar, that market continues to be strong. The backlogs were at a pretty high level compared to the last couple of years, so we're excited there. Roanoke -- the Roanoke team, even in a tough market, they reported the best results in Q3 since 2008, and their backlog remains pretty decent, at about 4 weeks or so, 35,000, 40,000 tons, and I think pricing has remained somewhat firm in the merchant arena. Steel of West Virginia, it sells primarily to the truck, trailer and material handling sector, and that has seen a little softness the last month or 2, and they're expecting a little softer, probably around 5% next year. But actually, that's 5% off of a very, very, very strong market, so their business continues to be pretty solid. In sheet or Flat Roll, the order rate, I think, continues to be -- backlog continues to be strong -- better across all sectors. I think there's a little softening on the coated products, which is likely, I think, seasonal in one aspect, but also, we're seeing some burning product imports, I think, that is impacting our volume in Jeffersonville [ph] business. And I think that's also impacting our Columbus backlog a little bit, but lead times continue to be 4-plus weeks out there. So Luke, generally, I think our order books are very, very solid. And a couple of tweaks in, so a little bit -- Dick, any thoughts? Richard P. Teets: Yes, I guess I can only add to what you said, that as a structural mill, that we do have some time on the medium section, though, because we've never gotten to a fourth crew. We've filled out the third crew, so medium section products, we're out selling and selling hard. And so filling that up, the third crew. And we've developed that market down in Pittsboro. We've added new products. That's what we're doing across the board. We've added threaded bar with our customer there. We're now making #8, 9, 10 and 11 threaded bars, and we're going to get this month, #18. We've done #20 bars and so that's an exciting product for very high rise buildings and for bridges being used across the country, and so these are new products that are coming on. Also, you mentioned Steel of West Virginia, we had some weakness in a little bit of their product line, and so therefore, we're developing bulb flats and 7-inch channels and so forth, so we're adding new sections all the time down there. And so -- and again, down at the Roanoke, we're running 100% of capacity, so no weakness showing there. So you mentioned the flat roll, nothing more to add other than we are watching the imports. We watch coated product imports. There's an extension agreement now, getting the 60-day notification there and going back to the way things were in 1998, '99, much higher duties are going to be applied to it, and things are going to clean up there, I believe. And so I think it'll tighten itself up in the first quarter. So yes, things are good. Mark D. Millett: Thanks, Dick. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I guess, secondly, it seems like a weird point in the cycle to be asking this question, but you're breaking shipment records across the construction divisions, both at the beam business at Columbus and in the fab space. Just as we think of -- it seems like we're just in the beginning of a recovery in construction, as we think of what a full construction recovery could look like, how would you sort of handicap how much more shipment upside you may have? Mark D. Millett: Again, not to publish our 2014's results, but 2013, we shipped a record for a 6.1 million tons. Obviously, we're headed above that this year. And that was 6.1 million tons, where our capacity today, excluding Columbus, was around 7.8 million tons. So as we said, we had about 1.5 million tons of latent capacity from 2013. So we've got, I think, great leverage going forward on the returning residential and nonresidential. And obviously, we've got a new Columbus mill that is absolutely revved up and rearing to go. Operator : The next question is from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I just had a question on trade cases, and I saw the Russian suspension elimination this morning, that was a nice positive for the industry. But also, one thing we've heard a lot about towards the end of the summer was that there's a potential for a trade case to be filed on Chinese cold-rolled and coated products, and I'm sure you guys probably were involved in that, but we haven't seen anything yet. I just wondered if you could perhaps provide an update on that. What's going on with that one? Richard P. Teets: Well, I will just tell you that we are constantly monitoring the imports. We've done investigations. A number of our competitors along with ourselves have worked together through our attorneys to do the investigations, both domestically and in the foreign countries, to determine what the domestic pricing are of those countries that we believe are guilty of dumping and shutting our shores. But we don't believe, along with our legal counsel, that the timing is correct at this moment for a successful case, but that may change as the markets change, and so we're constantly vigilant and ready to go at -- upon a discussion and enough agreement amongst our parties that we're ready to do it, so we're vigilant, is, I guess, the best way to say it. Mark D. Millett: Right. I think the general sentiment of the Trade Commission, I think, is turned positive toward our industry. If you look at the, obviously, the recent ruling on the Russian suspension of duty issue, that obviously helps us, helps the industry, and I think, in particular, it helps Columbus in the Southeast markets. You've seen the industry won the Korean OCTG ruling and they are filing for -- oil industry is filing a sort of a [indiscernible] line pipe case against Korea and Turkey, and I think this bodes well for us. It supports, I think, our sentiment that in the next year or 2, the countries will be constrained on hot-rolled coil and give some very, very positive market dynamics. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And then, one other question on imports. One thing we've been hearing is that because of the rail issues and higher trucking rates and higher barge rates, that there's been a lot more regionalization of pricing in the past several months, and I was wondering if you could kind of confirm that, I mean, now that you're actually both in the South and the Midwest. Are you seeing a big discrepancy in hot-rolled pricing in, I'm going to say in the Chicago area versus some of the more coastal regions in the South? Mark D. Millett: I think it -- given -- steel is a freight-sensitive commodity. Obviously, closer to the supply, you're going to get better pricing. And right now, where you've had a lot of Russian material come into Houston, and so the supply's down there, and you're definitely going to get that freight differential. Fortunately, I've got the facility. It's Midwest. It's a reasonable distance from the coast and we're not impacted quite as much as many of our customers -- competitors, I would say. Operator : The next question is from Tony Rizzuto of Cowen and Company. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Got a lot of questions here. First of all, the ferrous scrap market seems to be in a bit of a free fall. Obviously, a lot of factors driving that following a period of stability. Raw materials are down, strong dollar affecting Turkish purchases, and we're hearing more about Chinese semi-finished billets moving into other countries. What are your thoughts? And how do you see prices directionally over the near term and longer term playing out? Mark D. Millett: Russ? Russel B. Rinn: You've answered most of your question with the currencies and exports, and the lack of exports, and currently, the crash in, or current crash and very low levels of iron ore pricing, I think certainly bodes that things are going to be down in the scrap market. I think there's an abundance of supply due to lack of exports, so there's nothing that I can see that's going to put a real solid floor underneath the scrap market until we see some room in the iron ore pricing to compete on the international basis or the dollar weakens to the point where exports are attractive. Mark D. Millett: So Russ, that pressure is going to help re-establish the iron concentrate scrap ratio, that's been kind of at a little bit of a high the last 6 to 8 months. Russel B. Rinn: Absolutely. Mark D. Millett: Which is in my mind, a huge plus for the electric arc furnace produced and hopefully, put us back in the billets from a hot metal cost perspective again. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : What about you -- When you guys mentioned the Russian suspension, obviously, we've seen that come out, obviously, a positive for the industry. I guess, I was little bit surprised how quickly the discussion kind of came together. There was a lot of talk about a review process that was not expected to be completed until maybe even the first quarter of next year. Wondering how you feel about that, and obviously, this should be helpful. Particularly, should be helpful to you guys as you increase your exposure in the Southeast? How do you tend to look at that? Mark D. Millett: Well, given Russia is one of the largest importers of hot-rolled coil, constraining them is, obviously, I think, a big benefit to our industry. As I said earlier, strong, huge benefit for our Columbus facility that trades in the Southeast arena, and I'm not so sure we know what happened behind the scenes. Obviously, American-Russian relationship's aren't the best, and maybe that accelerated it. Richard P. Teets: Well, just for the record, we've been petitioning the Commerce Department for months. We've been signing documents and submitting records to them since midsummer, and so we were disappointed with how slow it was going midyear, and so the signals we were getting were disappointing. So this unexpected year-end movement is basically a catch-up to me, so I'm pleased with the performance of the Department of Commerce, and so it appeared to be fast, but it's been in the works for quite a while. Petitions have been in the works. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : It's interesting, because I was in Australia recently. I was talking to some of the big iron ore miners over there, and I was asking the questions about how they felt about possible trade laws against the Chinese in steel, and they seemed to hint that there was much greater sensitivity to that by steelmakers in other countries and this whole thing obviously, Russia and the sentiment against what's going on for obvious reasons. I think that's a key point here. Can you make any comments about is there some increased sensitivity on the Chinese front? Is that why you made the comment earlier that it's just not the right time? And maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit more, because we haven't seen obviously those trade cases filed, much rumored, but it's not the right timing. Maybe a little bit further expansion on that might be helpful. Richard P. Teets: I would just tell you that we have to look at all the possible participants in any trade case. We have to look at our -- the government looks at a lot of parameters, including your financial performance and order intake, what your sales prices have been. Again, the documents as to what the local prices have been, both in their originating countries as well as here. And so when you take a broad brush approach to it, all that has to be considered, and then you start gleaning out of the whole field as to which countries may or may not be suitable for a case. And if you have to eliminate too many of those countries and too many of the tons, it sort of plays against you, and you want to make sure that you have a -- you don't want to keep going back to the well for small pickings, let's say. So we want to make sure that you have a deliverable, number 1; and then number 2, that it's a worthy one. So we're watching it, and we're -- we have our data, and we will continue every quarter to refresh that data. Operator : The next question is from Sohail Tharani of Goldman Sachs. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Just some housekeeping questions. What is the -- so Theresa, what is the interest expense depreciation, CapEx, et cetera, to think of over the coming quarters? Theresa E. Wagler: The interest expense on a quarterly basis with the new cap structure is probably going to be just less than $45 million per quarter. Depreciation this quarter was $58 million, but that -- with the estimated purchase price allocation, these numbers could change, but it's more likely to be closer to maybe $75 million per quarter going forward. But that will -- we'll have to give you a better number on the January call. And then CapEx for this year, we expect it to be somewhere between $120 million and $130 million for the year. And moving into 2015, the early estimates would be somewhere between $150 million and $175 million, but that's without specific projects or anything like that. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Great. I want to ask a question on the fabrication side. Your shipments, revenue, operating profit, operating profit per ton, everything, every one of those metrics was highest we've ever seen, even before the 2008 or late 2008 downturn. I was just wondering was there any specific projects you got this quarter? Or is this something like a trend we should think about going forward? Or something, especially in this quarter, which drove this significant upside? Christopher A. Graham: Well, you talk about a little housekeeping, let's just -- I'd make a few comments on fabrication. Our joist-and-deck backlog remained strong entering the fourth quarter, and I want to just mention specifically our teams and our customers who have executed very well year-to-date. Together, they've worked on a lot of mutually beneficial projects, but to your point, nothing out of the ordinary. Look forward to continuing to do so going forward. We'd like to thank our joist-and-deck customers for continuing to afford us the opportunity to earn their business each and every day. The biggest impact on -- the biggest outside factor was probably with the capacity in the industry, more matches the demand better than it has in the last 30 years. So we'd like to believe that it's kind of a new paradigm, and we stand prepared to service current levels or even higher levels. The question earlier about fabrication capacity and how that affects things, to achieve our current output, 90% of our production occurs during daylight hours, 5, maybe, 6 days a week. This leaves an awful lot of room for continued growth, and it's a matter of adding a crew here or there, as Mark mentioned earlier, to respond rather quickly to larger demand. So we don't see New Millennium up against any kind of ceiling in almost -- virtually any scenario. Theresa E. Wagler: And so one thing I would just point out is in 2008, we're configured much differently today with the national footprint, with 6 basically operating facilities, so we're structured much differently than we were in 2008 as well. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, that's a good point. Also, on the rail side. Mark or Dick, what is the market? And where do you think you will be in the next couple of years, once the premium rail qualifications are done? And what percentage you think of your mix will be premium or head hardened by -- let's say in the next few years? Richard P. Teets: Well, I think, the -- in general, the mix in the industry -- well, first off, the market. The market continues to strengthen, as Mark pointed out, in the growth of maintenance track, as well as new track, it's probably over 1 million tons, 1.1 million. It's a good, steady market. In general, I'd tell you that head-hardened or premium product is greater than 50%, and it continues to move in the upper direction as a percentage year-over-year, and that's for 2 reasons : number one, it's a reduction in the spread between premium rail and standard rail; and number two, the higher utilization rates of the various tracks give the railroads less time to take the tracks down for replacement, so therefore, they're willing to spend a higher amount of money on the track itself when it's being installed. And so our own attempt to take advantage of that, as Mark pointed out, we're committed to pursue about 350,000 tons of railroad products, and our production will mimic the national percentages as best our equipment can handle. And of course, the Structural and Rail division is always asking for, like any division, more money to expand, and we will watch what they do and how they utilize it, and make those decisions appropriately. Operator : The next question is from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : It's Jorge with DB. My question is really on the steel fab side as well, not to beat a dead horse, but if you could just really talk about what's driving that sequential uptick in EBIT performance. We saw very strong gain in volumes there, and you've been telling you're not capacity constrained. Could you just talk about what is the demand driver? What's pulling that product? And do you believe that those products are import defensive, as you flagged earlier? Mark D. Millett: I think, obviously, the demand is picking up across the industry. I think the team has done a phenomenal job building a national footprint there. And so they're getting into the, what we call the big-box consumers, the Wal-Marts, the Home Depots, people that want a national supply and not a regional supply. So the market has picked up. I think the team has done a phenomenal job picking up market share because of that. And with the financial or the, sort of, step function improvement in the financials is volume driven. It's a business that, when Chris puts on a new shift at one of his plants, I mean, the profitability of that plant shoots up dramatically. With increased demand today, and we still got -- it's still very elastic, our capability, but when we need more tons, it's not a matter of spending capital. The lines are there. It's just a matter of recruiting our crews. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. But is it just -- you said that you're now accessing these big-box retailers. Is that something new? Or can you point to any kind of specific end use that would be driving those kinds of product demand in U.S.? Christopher A. Graham: No, I think Mark just makes the point that we are more diverse in our approach to the market, not just auction markets, but national accounts, metal building accounts and things like that. So we've not only expanded our physical footprint, we've also had a different approach to market and continued then leveraging the volume, compresses all of our costs across the board. And this is not something that was unexpected at these levels, this is what the team's been planning. And we're poised to continue to capitalize on these opportunities. Mark D. Millett: And as I said earlier, if you look at the Steel Joist Institute numbers, year-over-year joist shipments have increased 21%. So that's sort of general demand and it supports our view that's continued, that nonresidential construction continues to grow. The national footprint, I would say, has allowed us to surpass the overall industry growth in our markets, and our joist shipments increased 35%. Christopher A. Graham: And the projects are not -- I'm sorry, the projects are not limited to just the big box. We're into a good healthy mode where if you're just doing institutional private work, it's never a good sign. If you're just doing the big box, it's not as healthy. But we're doing a good mix and our industry is seeing a good mix across the board. Operator : The next question is from Timna Tanners of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Two questions. One was now that you've gotten into the Columbus facility and gotten to look around, anything that's surprising or new? And any thoughts on ramping up volume? Is there enough market appetite to bring it to full speed in terms of both value-add and volume? Mark D. Millett: Well, we were pretty excited when we were the fortunate winner. Just the basic value without synergies, without anything, it was an incredible opportunity for us. I think we've only become more and more excited as the teams -- and again, this is not a top-down, where we're injecting and forcing SDI stuff. It's a 2-way street. You've got 2 incredibly talented teams. And it's a case of 1 plus 1 is going to be at least 3, 4, if not 5. So we remain incredibly excited about the bricks and the mortar and the technology there and the product diversification that it's going to provide us and provide our customers. We're incredibly excited about the geographic diversity it gives us. It's got access into the Southern markets. But as importantly or more importantly, access to the Mexican market, which is a -- that's growing from an automotive standpoint almost exponentially in Monterrey and to the south. The capacity, or if you look at, or just do a little bit of back calculation, we did ship, as we said, about 175,000 tons. So the 175,000 tons of shipments accrued to us for the couple of weeks we owned Columbus, you got to be a little careful there. There's about 30,000, 31,000 tons of that which is coil sales that Severstal had already in the works. So a real number from the mill is about 144,000 tons. And you extrapolate that out, it comes out to roughly the 3.4 million tons of hot-band capacity that's been advertised. Was there a production record last month? Richard P. Teets: We had a CSP, a [indiscernible] record, 30-day, month record, and we also had [indiscernible] mill, pull mill record and we also had galvanizing pipe [indiscernible]. And again, that's not just -- that's not because of SDI, that's because of cooperation and integration, communications. It's a lot of things. And so, everyone's excited. So it's small things, small tweaks, and it's -- there's just a lot of potential. Again, not overnight, but a lot of upside opportunities. Mark D. Millett: I think we already stated that the purchase price was pretty conservative, 6x the expected 2015 EBITDA. Obviously, our expectation was that the markets remain as they are today or strengthening to achieve that. And in all honestly, I think it should allow for higher than 3-year cycle metal spreads. I think we stated at some point that synergies over the longer term are going to be about $30 million; $10 million, $15 million of that perhaps last year -- not last year, 2015, next year. As Dick said, over the longer term, we expect, from what we see, to garner a lot more than that. So it's an incredibly exciting opportunity for us. And again, just being down there with the guys and girls and their families and their kids on Saturday, they are pumped. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And if we could get over to the uses of free cash flow. So I think you've been really clear that even with this transaction, you're pretty excited about your ability to pay down quickly and have a lot of extra liquidity for other alternatives. Can you just remind us of some of the options that you're looking at other priorities of free cash flow use? Mark D. Millett: Well, I think as we look post-acquisition, our capital profile, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong. As you said, I think we -- we currently plan to pay down some debt next year, to allow us to get more comfortably within our sort of preferred net leverage of 3x or less. CapEx is, as Theresa suggested, it looks to be in the $150 million, $160 million range. I mean, that's clearly -- We're still looking at and still analyzing some organic growth opportunities for us. Earlier this year, even without the Columbus addition, we increased dividend by 5% and we would like to continue at a positive profile there. And as we already said, we will continue to remain committed to prudent growth, wherever that growth may take us. Operator : The next question is from Matt Murphy of UBS. Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : On the prudent growth, I mean, we saw the Gallatin mill sell. Are you still looking to go in the direction of actual capacity? Or is it sort of downstream value-add? Are you focusing in any one area right now? Mark D. Millett: I would say, our focus would be downstream value-add more than anything. Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. Maybe just another housekeeping one. Can you give any guidance on go-forward levels of SG&A? Theresa E. Wagler: There's really nothing in particular that we think will change dramatically. We kind of tend to look at it on a percentage of sales basis and it tends to be pretty steady. And with the addition of Columbus, we'd expect it to still stay kind of in that range of the percentage of sales. Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. That's great. And then maybe just one on Minnesota ops. So outside, I guess, of the iron recovery, how do you feel about the process? You commented last quarter that you expected some significant improvement. Is this still something where you could see it profitable in 2015? Or what's the outlook? Mark D. Millett: Well, I think, we're pretty excited with what we're seeing and at least from our perspective. The guys had a step-function improvement across the board, not the least being a positive financial impact to us. Albeit still a loss, it's still a lot less loss than we've had in years past. We're pretty confident. And again, it depends where transfer pricing takes us. It's somewhat market dependent. But we'll certainly be, we believe, cash positive going in early 2015, and we'll see where the markets take us from there. Operator : The next question is from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Theresa, I had a question on the sheet mix, if you had that available. Theresa E. Wagler: Certainly. So I have the Butler Flat Roll mill mix. For the third quarter, they had shipments of hot-rolled of 299,000 tons; P&O of 92,000 tons; cold-rolled of 60,000 tons; hot-rolled galvanized was 120,000 tons; cold-rolled galvanized was 43,000 tons; painted products were 114,000 tons; and Galvalume was 10,000 tons, for a total of 738,000. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And should we assume that Columbus was mostly HRC? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And you had talked about the D&A being $58 million, going to $75 million, in your release, you had $66 million. And I realize some of that probably had purchase price accounting. I'm just trying to bridge that into the fourth quarter. Theresa E. Wagler: It was $66 million actually. What was reported in the cash flow, Phil, was both amortization and depreciation. So the number that I gave you earlier was just the depreciation amount. And again, it's still early on the purchase accounting side, but our thinking is that depreciation is going to be closer to probably $75 million per quarter. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So out of that $14.5 million that you gave for the purchase price accounting this quarter, was there a lot of that D&A stuff up there, that was just all inventory? Theresa E. Wagler: It was very little D&A, it was almost all inventory. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then as far as the other expenses, was that about $20 million in there that you had for the acquisition? Theresa E. Wagler: It was slightly more than that. Again, the total adjustments were about $40 million. So we had $14.5 million going through COGS. You had about $25.5 million going through other expense. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Terrific. And then just one quick one. As far as your nonresidential construction exposure overall in the steel business, any way, Mark, to categorize how much of your steel shipment is either going into the nonres market or infrastructure markets? How you think about that? Mark D. Millett: What is going in today or what leverage that we have going forward? Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : No, I'm just trying to think about how much of your steel business is tied to nonres right now, just on the finished steel side, not on fabrication. Mark D. Millett: [indiscernible] Christopher A. Graham: [indiscernible] Mark D. Millett: I guess the simple answer is -- just we're [indiscernible] . Operator : The next question is from Andrew Lane of Morningstar. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : So we view the use of hot liquid pig iron charge at Butler as a real differentiator for your Flat Roll division. How does the Columbus mill currently obtain iron units? And do you plan on making any changes as to how you'll supply iron units to that operation? Would you be shipping HBI there from Butler? Or maybe just any details you can provide on that? Mark D. Millett: Historically, Columbus has consumed roughly in the 20% to 25% range for pig iron and HBI, principally pig iron, imported in. Obviously, we had a relationship with Russia, so I'm sure they had some Russian coming in and some Brazilian. The line dynamics with the Minnesota operation and without Columbus, we actually became pig iron long, and there obviously, the Columbus operations on a consolidated basis, pig iron short. So there's no doubt, I'm sure that some of that, the [indiscernible] will find its way down to Columbus. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. So the freight cost wouldn't be prohibitive across that distance? Mark D. Millett: Not really. No. Operator : The next question is from Brian Yu of Citi. Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Mark, I've got a markets-related question and it's tied in a little bit to what Tony asked earlier in that if I look at where the scrap markets are, heavy melt and shredded, it's about the same as where we were last year. Hot-rolled coil prices did come down, and it's about the same. But in the international markets, you've got iron ore that's down about $50, met coal that's down $40. So that means like blast furnace input costs, again, the international markets are down about a $100. And I'm just trying to figure out why is it that scrap prices are still resilient here. Do you see enough of the move in scrap price so that the U.S., mini mills can regain some of this cost differential that we've seen basically flare out? Mark D. Millett: Well, we believe so. In fact, we've seen it the last month or so, and quite likely in November, given the -- where the export market pricing is today, there's a likelihood that scrap is going move down for sure. December, who knows? Maybe -- we don't have a crystal ball that clear or that far ahead. But we do feel that -- and as you say, scrap has been very, very sticky compared to iron ore here. Iron ore earlier has some incredibly weak fundamentals given the Chinese produced growth. So it's come off a lot stronger than scrap, but I think longer term, we'll see scrap move toward that historical basis. Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. What would you attribute the strength in scrap to? And then more specifically, I guess, for November, any guess on what you think prices could go down by? Mark D. Millett: I think we refrain from putting numbers other than directionality. As you know, it's an incredibly tough market, and I'm not sure Russ and I are any better than anyone else. Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. All right. Next question just on Magnetation. You guys mentioned that you're going to bring in some equipment to try to fix some of the fine-up line. Is this some minor -- like you're putting in additional screens? And then, you also, can give us a sense of where Magnetation -- or not Magnetation, but just Mesabi Nuggets costs are today relative to that $340 to $350 target? Mark D. Millett: Well, the -- firstly, the equipment we're putting in -- and just to add color, as we mine the basin, it went from a coarse tailing to a very fine tailing, and our equipment just don't get the yield recovery off finer material. The actual amount of material flying through is far greater than the rate of capacity of the line, which is not recovering the finer stuff. And the equipment going in, again, it's already been operational. I do believe on ongoing basis, Magnetation, we should retrieve that recovery and get the cost back down. That's the intent and expectation. Relative to the current cost, again, we refrain from sharing that. We are still confident in the $340, $350 cash number going forward, which will allow us, given the current market, to the transfer price, to be cash positive in '15, early '15. Operator : The next question is from Aldo Mazzaferro of Macquarie. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : I just wanted to ask a question on the pricing, Theresa, for the quarter. It came in at around $840. Can you comment whether there was an impact of mix from the Severstal material in that number? Theresa E. Wagler: Aldo, they only had 175,000 tons of our total 1.9 million tons shipped. So any influence they would have had would have really been minimal. The drivers of the average price improvement really were, as I mentioned, from the Flat Roll division and from the Structural and Rail division. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Right. So going forward, Theresa, if you did about, say 800,000 tons a quarter, that would be a bigger chunk, about 30%, 35% of your mix. Would you -- I mean, am I far off base if I were to assume something like about a $100 a ton differential in pricing versus your average versus the Columbus mill? Theresa E. Wagler: We're not -- I probably am not going to go there, Aldo. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Okay. All right. Well, I would note that the productivity of that place seems amazingly good, it had something like 0.4 man-hours, so congratulations on a great deal. And Dick, can I ask you one quick question on the suspension agreement with the Russians? About 3/4 of what they import to the U.S. is in the form of semifinished slabs and stuff. Would you say that these large tariffs they're talking about, are those going to cover the slabs or are those just on flat rolled -- hot-rolled coil, you think? Richard P. Teets: No. It actually only covers hot-band plate and coil. So it's only those 2 products. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Great. So not the slab. There's no tariffs or quotas on slab, right, as far as I know. Richard P. Teets: No. You're correct. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Okay. One final thing, did you say you lost some tonnage in the quarter at Butler due to an outage? Can you say how much that was about? Mark D. Millett: We just had a regular scheduled outage of 4-day... Richard P. Teets: 4-day maintenance outage. Operator : The next question is from Nick Jarmoszuk of Royal Bank of Canada. Nicholas Jarmoszuk - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I had a question on Columbus. Given the production figures that you guys have seen in the past month, how are you guys thinking about debottlenecking opportunities and what would the capital be involved to expand the capacity there? Mark D. Millett: I think it's already demonstrating an incredible capability through the hot mill, 3.4 is, I think, is its rated capacity. Richard P. Teets: Well, that's its desired capacity, it's rated only by our own wishes. Mark D. Millett: And it's likely, if the team does what the Butler team did, there may be some, a little upside on the hot-band production. Obviously, our intent is to increase the value-add output there. So the actual shipping volume may actually come off a little bit as -- because of the unit lost through pickling and cold reduction. There's not a huge amount of capital, at least I see it, to unbottleneck. It's more a market opportunity, getting in the right markets and just fully utilizing the capabilities that they have today. Operator : The next question is from Sam Dubinsky of Wells Fargo. Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just a couple of quick ones. Can you discuss what percent of your business next year will be contract-based or will you still mostly be a spot-selling market? Mark D. Millett: The latter. We'll be principally spot-based. Any contractual business we do is just on a volume commitment basis with some form of index pricing. We don't have any contracted, fixed-priced, long-term deals. Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then another housekeeping one. Just last one, steel fabrications, did the quarter include any benefit or synergies from Columbus? Or is that really just a clean quarter on improved construction demand? Mark D. Millett: It's just an absolute clean phenomenal team job. Sam Dubinsky - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And given how high the business is running and given your commentary on improved fundamentals, do you think this division can buck typical seasonality? Or should we model profit down in coming quarters just due to weather? Christopher A. Graham: Well, it has bucked seasonality to some extent as it's recovered from the 400,000-ton annualized rate in the market to over 800,000 or 900,000 this year. As you get up closer to the historical norms, we would expect seasonality to rear its head, again, some degree. But our backlogs are still at historically higher numbers going into the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question is from Charles Bradford of Bradford Research. Charles A. Bradford - Bradford Research, Inc.: In looking at the purchase price of Columbus, have you made any kind of calculation of what the replacement cost would be for the asset? Theresa E. Wagler: Well, CapEx, that's part of the many-pronged methods of which you look at valuation. So that's something that's kind of contemplated. I'm not sure it's something that we'd want to.... Charles A. Bradford - Bradford Research, Inc.: So the question really gets down to, I guess, Big River, which is likely to be -- looks likely to be built. Where would the differences be? Because they're talking about electrical steels and a few other things, yet it has the same parents as Columbus. Any idea on where the differences could be? Richard P. Teets: Well, what we found interestingly is during our due diligence that there were quite a few items at Columbus that were off balance sheet, let's say, from an asset perspective. So I can't tell you what -- how they're going to do their accounting there. So when they announced how much the cost is, that's a question for them. I would tell you replacement cost is higher than what we paid for it. We got, I think, a very fair deal for it, because they had 2 galvanizing lines, 2 pickle lines. They have a reinspect line and so forth. They also spent quite a bit of money in building that line up. They put a lot of concrete into it. They used different construction techniques than we would have utilized. And so we got a good value, a very good value for the assets. And then they're also in a very high seismic zone area. So they're going to spend even more money building a steel mill in that location than others have traditionally built. So whatever, so good luck. Charles A. Bradford - Bradford Research, Inc.: There was some talk when you were looking at Columbus that the location wasn't ideal because it's not exactly on the river. Is there some kind of a transportation cost penalty? Mark D. Millett: Charles, there is, but not to the extent that we kind of presumed or assumed over the years, and there are other benefits that offsets that. Charles A. Bradford - Bradford Research, Inc.: Thank you very much. Mark D. Millett: And Charles, going back to the commentary on Big River, [indiscernible] Columbus, as I said, and I was starting to get a little bit insulted by any connotation that those folks are going to compete with us. You've got 2 of the best, most efficient sheet steelmaking teams in the damn world between Butler and Columbus. And you saw the same team is building Big River, and the financial results were not necessarily phenomenal, in the early stages of Severstal. And to use the steelmaker vernacular, the Columbus guys are ready to kick ass. Operator : The next question is from Nathan Littlewood of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I just had a question on the fabrication business capacity. You mentioned that it was quite possible to add additional shifts there and increase the throughput. Could you just clarify how many shifts are there now? How many could you conceptually add if you were go, whatever, double or triple time? And how should we think about the potential for that business on a volume basis, if the demand were to exist for it? Christopher A. Graham: Well, there's a minimum arrangement that most of us have found in the industry that you need to hit to a certain point to be able to make a fair return in this world. And much times, that is a 3-line configuration that gives you the ability to cover most products required in an efficient manner in any given project. We are basically at that configuration. And beyond that, it's simply just adjusting to the market conditions. It's very hard to explain. You have to make a minimal investment to build joist in the first place, and that typically enables you to satisfy the market and a huge surge opportunities at times, with more folks on the team. So I'm at a loss to really explain it any better, other than we have a lot of latent capacity that doesn't cost us a lot in the big picture, because we have to build what we have to build to build a minimum amount of joist. So I hate to promise that we could do, run around the clock, but we've never seen a market call for that. Theresa? Theresa E. Wagler: So is it fair to say, Chris, that our market share today is between around 35% to 40%. And it's hard to see a market for joist and deck where we would not be able to increase our volume to match that market share. Christopher A. Graham: The way we're positioned today, and there's never been a market in the history, if we look back, that would tax our ability to help to service at those levels or maybe somewhat higher. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. So if we could look at the historic maximum size of the market, keep the market share relatively constant and say, that's potentially the blue sky scenario then. Is that fair? Christopher A. Graham: It's fair. Theresa E. Wagler: Yes. It's fair. Christopher A. Graham: I wish I had said that. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : The other question I have for you, and apologies if this is a little naive, my U.S. geography is perhaps not as good as some of the other people on this call, but the imports that you guys are competing with in the sort of Indiana region, where would they be physically coming from? Would they be coming from down in Texas or somewhere further up the coast? Mark D. Millett: Well, there's a couple of points of entry, but it's not necessarily competing with a physical ton. It's competing with the, sort of the pricing pressure that the selective imports are putting on the market. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. I guess where I was wanting to go with the question is I'm trying to understand this sort of freight differential between the coast and inland at the moment. I mean, you guys are very more focused in the inland parts of the country as I understand it. And as previous, someone else was asking about, we've obviously seen rail and trucking rates go up a lot. So I'd just like to understand if we could, what is that sort of freight barrier at the moment, maybe in dollars per ton? And where do you see it as having been historically? Mark D. Millett: Well, if you're coming up, obviously, a massive amount comes from the Houston area, to bring material up to the Midwest is probably today, and this would be a combination barge. And it depends where you are. If you are on the river, it's going to be less, but to a land bound Midwest arena, such as Butler, it's probably $50-plus per ton. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And where do you suppose that might have been, say a year ago? Mark D. Millett: Not much, probably $10 off that. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. That's not so bad. Cool. The final question I had was just on Minnesota. We did do some math on this a little while ago, and based on the longer-term targets that you guys have talked about in reaching the 360-kiloton per annum, it seems to me that if everything goes as planned, the potential earnings opportunity here is about $16 million per annum. And I guess, obviously, that's come down over the last couple of years as the project targets aren't quite as ambitious as they once were. But when I think about a $16 million opportunity in the context of earnings losses, which have been kind of $5 million or $10 million a quarter, it's going to take a lot of years to recover in earnings the losses that you guys have been making. Is there something that might not be apparent to us in terms of exit costs for this business? I guess I'm just a little confused at your apparent commitment and dedication to the thing. And with all due respect, I mean, it seems like a relatively small earnings opportunity at this point, a relatively small upside in the context of other things, which potentially much bigger earnings, it seems to be taking up equal amounts of your time. Mark D. Millett: Well, I think the -- it's easy to be the Monday morning quarterback. I guess it wasn't too long ago, I think 2012, that people thought that pig iron was going to be $500 a ton or more. So and that was the original investment premise. To your point, obviously, raw material and commodities are off. And today, with pig iron in that $400, $410 range on a NOLA basis, the project can be cash breakeven and eventually make a little bit of money. It certainly gives us a hedge, though, against scrap markets and a very secure supply of very, very high-quality material that can facilitate for further productivity and [indiscernible] some capital there, and I think we're looking at perhaps more on a incremental basis, than looking at the project in full scope. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And if we were to get to a point where for whatever reasons, things don't work out, and you said, you know what, we had enough, we're going to walk away from here. What sort of closure and exit and rehab costs might be associated with that decision? Mark D. Millett: We have not even studied that. Operator : The next question is from Sohail Tharani of Goldman Sachs. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Mark, in one of the remarks, you mentioned that of the 175,000-ton shipments from Columbus, there was something which belonged to Severstal Russia, I think you said? Mark D. Millett: Well, the Severstal were using the American organization to bring coil in and resell, just kind on a brokerage basis. As we acquired, in the transition, we obviously took ownership of the remaining coils, sort of en route. And that's about 30,000, 31,000 tons of that Russian coil that we acquired. It was already presold, so there's no risk there to it, but that just went through the volume. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got you. Was that on the balance sheet of Severstal -- of Columbus? Or was it on the balance sheet -- entirety of purchase, was it on the Columbus balance sheet or on the Severstal Russia balance sheet? Theresa E. Wagler: It was on the Columbus balance sheet. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. I'm just wondering that the Columbus profitability, was it -- before you purchased, was it a little bit augmented by this Russian steel coming in? Richard P. Teets: They took a flat $20-a-ton fee for the handling of it. And they did that so that they basically then had somebody else out marketing the Severstal Russian steel. They wanted to know what was going on in the marketplace, so there wasn't any other wild pricing going on. They wanted to have some control of it. So they took a fee for the handling of those transactions. As soon as we purchased it, we said no more sales, we didn't want any more transactions going down. And then when we closed it, those ships were already en route and those hit the dock and cleared through all the sales and they were behind us. Yes, that's it. And they are all behind us. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Great. I understand. And also one more thing, on the content you mentioned of pig iron/HBI you put in your Butler facility, 25% to 30%, is that going to remain? Because there's a lot of talk with this DRI coming up in a couple of other places that people think of using as much as 70%, 80% or 60% DRI. I was just wondering in your experience, what is the limit you can go, because pig iron apparently is even better than DRI in terms of melting capability and so forth. And I think Mesabi product is also supposed to be very good content of iron. I'm just wondering what is your view, how far you want to go with this thing in terms of how much you want to use as a percentage of total input mix. Mark D. Millett: Okay. Firstly, so the percentage I mentioned, the 20%, 25% was at Columbus, not Butler. Butler has historically been, I think, around 12%, and that's been the combination of the liquid cast iron plus the nuggets. If you look at -- and honestly, it's a value proposition in the most part. It's just what is the cheapest balance of raw material, at the end of the day, in your ladle of molten steel. DRI, you can -- there are people out there that are running almost 100% of DRI. You've got to have enough shop fully equipped. And obviously, on the pig iron side, you tend to be limited because pig iron has a higher carbon content, and you get to a point where you get much more than about 25%, 30%, you slow down the operation because, yes, you've melted it, but you have to remove and decarburize the material. So there is kind of a practical limit of around about 25%, 30%, in the most part, for pig iron. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over back to Mr. Millet for any final and closing remarks. Mark D. Millett: Well, thanks, Ryan. And I guess just quite briefly, if you look at SDI as a company today, I do believe our sole headwind is just the import pressure. Beside that, I'm extremely optimistic for our industry, and again, really optimistic for SDI as a company. We continue to see solid U.S. GDP momentum, particularly on the non-service steel consumer sector. Residential construction, we believe, albeit choppy and noisy, it's upward. Nonres construction is truly growing and is a positive trend. Energy markets are growing, and those will constrain hot-band coil availability, I think, in America in the next couple of years. So I think that will bode very well for us. Automotive space strong and there's been very positive structural changes in our domestic steel industry in the last year or 2. Scrap pricing, as we suggested, we feel is on a downward trend, and I'm not so sure the historic ratio will be totally established, but certainly, it's headed toward that level. And I think that gives us margin expansion opportunities as an electric-arc furnace producer. And I think it sets a stage, an incredible stage, for SDI. We can leverage our latent steel capacity. Even before Columbus, we still got a lot of volume related to residential and nonresidential construction that we can exploit. We're starting to capitalize now on our organic growth projects of premium rail and also for Engineered Bar. And we're going to gain incredible value combining the teams of Butler and Columbus and truly optimizing the margin, the value we can get from that. And as we've discussed, Chris and the teams have done a phenomenal job on the clarification side. So we've got all engines or all cylinders are kind pumping out. You combine that, you've got incredibly strong cash flow, great balance sheet, allows us to consider future growth opportunities. We truly have terrific customers. And most importantly, we've got a phenomenal team. And so I think, everyone around this table, we get up every day, we're in the steel industry, but we're pretty damned excited to come to work and work with all our employees. So to each and every one of them, I would say, hey, thank you, and work safely each and every day. Thank you for your support, folks. Bye bye. Operator : Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Millett: Super. Thank you, Marlene. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. I hope and trust 2015 will be bringing you all health, happiness and prosperity. 2014 was transformational for Steel Dynamics. Due to the foundation put in place during the last several years, both operationally and financially, we're able to execute on organic growth initiatives while also taking advantage of acquisition opportunities. We strengthened our company and provided more opportunity for our employees, our customers and our communities. Our positioning was rewarded through 2014 as we introduced new value-added product capabilities, further diversified our product portfolio and geographic presence and successfully executed our large acquisition, the addition of the Columbus Flat Roll mill, which adds approximately 3.4 million tons of hot-rolled capacity, bringing our total annual capability to some 11 million tons. The dedication and hard work across the Steel Dynamics team and at all platforms has certainly been the cornerstone, making 2014 a memorable year. Despite 2015 began with some market instability, we believe our earnings catalysts and underlying market fundamentals support the opportunity for a strong 2015. Now I'll turn the call over to Theresa for a few comments on our financial results, and after that, I'll share my thoughts on where I see both the near- and longer-term opportunities for SDI. Theresa? Theresa E. Wagler: Good morning. Despite the challenges related to effective steel imports in 2014, we achieved significant growth and solid financial results for the year, remaining a lowest cost, highly efficient steel company and delivering quality products and services to our customers. We achieved another year of best-in-class performance compared to our peers. The year was full of records. We achieved record consolidated revenues of $8.8 billion, 18% higher than prior year; record steel shipments of 7.4 million tons, 20% higher than 2013; record steel fabrication shipments of 481,000 tons and fabrication operating income of $52 million. That's almost 7.5x last year's results. We also achieved record liquidity levels of $1.6 billion, along with a very strong credit profile. For the year 2014, excluding the noncash asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter and the purchase accounting and acquisition costs related to Columbus during the year, adjusted net income was $323 million or $1.35 per share. This compares to net income of $189 million or $0.83 per diluted share in 2013, a 71% improvement over prior year's net income on an adjusted basis. On the same adjusted basis, 2014 operating income was $612 million, representing a 58% improvement over last year's results. Including the mentioned charges, on an unadjusted basis, 2014 GAAP reported net income was $157 million or $0.67 per diluted share, and operating income was $320 million. For the fourth quarter of 2014, and excluding the same items, our adjusted net income was $97 million or $0.40 per diluted share, within the range of our adjusted guidance of between $0.38 and $0.42. Our adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $195 million. Describing the adjustments, during the fourth quarter, we recorded lower cost or market material -- excuse me, we recorded lower cost or market raw material inventory adjustments for Minnesota and additional purchase accounting adjustments related to Columbus. This reduced our gross margin by approximately $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share. We don't estimate additional future purchase accounting adjustments. Based on our purchase price allocation, the price is very close to book value, and we recorded only $20 million of goodwill related to the Columbus acquisition. Regarding the fixed asset impairment charge related to our Minnesota operations, their operating performance reached a steady pace in the fourth quarter of 2014, indicating the consistency in production, capability, process and cost structure. As we indicated in our December 17 guidance release, we intended to perform an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of their fixed assets. We concluded that the carrying value of fixed asset was not fully recoverable when compared to their estimated remaining future and discounted cash flows. Accordingly, we recorded a pretax noncash fixed asset impairment charge of $260 million in the fourth quarter. After giving effect to our joint venture ownership percentage, the impact on consolidated results was $213 million pretax or $0.55 per diluted share. Mark will share further comments regarding the operations in his commentary in a moment. Fourth quarter 2014 revenues were $2.5 billion, 8% higher than the sequential third quarter. Our gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was comparable to the third quarter when taking into consideration purchase accounting and lower cost or market adjustments. You may also have noted there interest expense increased $13 million in the quarter. This related to the September combined bond issues of $1.2 billion used to fund the Columbus acquisition. Pertaining to our steel operations, annual 2014 volumes and metal spread both expanded. Annual operating income improved 38% to $706 million, excluding purchase accounting. For the fourth quarter, we also achieved record shipments of 2.3 million tons, a 23% improvement over the third quarter, but our metal spread contracted. Scrap raw material prices declined 3%, while overall steel prices fell an average of 4%. Excluding the Columbus purchase accounting charges, fourth quarter operating income for our steel operations increased to $224 million in the quarter based on volume improvement. For our metals recycling business, the environment is still very challenging. Year-over-year, 2014 ferrous and nonferrous shipments increased, but metal spread contracted based on falling commodity prices during the year. Full year operating income declined 31% to $44 million. For the fourth quarter, both ferrous and nonferrous shipments decreased as both export demand and domestic steel demand declined. Ferrous metal spread contracted due to the oversupplied market environment, and fourth quarter operating income decreased to $3 million. On a much different note, our fabrication operations excelled in 2014, recording record shipments and record operating income of $52 million or $108 per ton shipped compared to $19 in 2013. The momentum continued into the fourth quarter despite seasonality of construction, making another quarterly record in operating income of $22 million based on record quarterly sales and expanding margins. Operating income per ton shipped improved from $135 in the third quarter of this year to $159 in the fourth quarter, an 18% improvement. We continue to see improvements in the underlying nonresidential construction demand. This is good news for everyone. During the fourth quarter, we had strong cash flow generation of $320 million, and for the full year, we reached our second highest annual level of cash flow from operations of $618 million, almost double 2013 annual results. Annual working capital provided $36 million of funding and $117 million in the fourth quarter based on decreased customer accounts and inventory levels. 2014 capital investments totaled $112 million, well within a typical level of spending as we completed construction of our 2 larger organic growth projects related to SBQ and premium rail, and we focused on the integration of Columbus. We currently estimate 2015 capital expenditures to be between $150 million and $175 million, but this number could increase as we proceed through the year and evaluate new projects. We also allocated $105 million in cash dividends to our shareholders during 2014. Our Board of Directors increased our annual cash dividend by 10% in the first quarter of 2013 and another 5% in the first quarter of 2004, evidencing their continued confidence in the strength of our cash generation capability, financial position and optimism concerning our future. Throughout market cycles, our operating performance generate strong cash flow from operations based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations. In late November, we increased the amount of our senior secured credit facility and extended its maturity to 2019. We expanded our revolver from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion and entered into a new $250 million term loan. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the ability to further increase the combined facility size by a minimum of an additional $750 million. Combined with our strong cash flow performance, the resulting record liquidity at December 31, 2014, was $1.6 billion, comprised of our undrawn revolver and $361 million of available cash At the end of the year, our net debt was $2.7 billion, with trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, including a full year of Columbus. This results to net leverage of 2.5x, a profile already aligned with our preferred through-cycle net leverage of less than 3x. This is a testament to our disciplined approach to grow, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook is incredibly flexible. We don't have any near-term meaningful maturities, and those of a longer term are well laddered. We believe that our capital structure and our credit profile has the flexibility to not only sustain current operations but to support additional growth. Thank you. Mark? Mark D. Millett: Super. Thank you, Theresa. And I think, as I listen to that, we tell our teams that if we execute on our strategy and remain committed, the financial results fallout, I think it's an incredible testament to our employees. We've got 7,700 people now, and as a whole, yes, do we have some challenges in small pockets of our business? For sure. What an absolutely incredible performance by our guys and girls. So thank you to that team. The -- again, thanks, Theresa. The constant for -- or in our company is safety. It's an integral part of our culture. Nothing is more important than creating and maintaining a safe work environment for each and every employee. Our safety performance continues to be better than industry averages, and our overall incident rate continues to decrease. But our goal remains a 0 safety incident work environment. About half of our locations went the entire year without an incident. So we know this high standard is possible, and we're going to be implementing new initiatives this year to continue our drive toward our goal. Our total steel shipments for the quarter were a record 2.3 million tons. We achieved annual record shipments from each of our 3 Midwest mills. Columbus also achieved their highest shipping rate this past year, and again, congratulations to all those teams. It's worth noting, despite high imports and if you exclude Columbus shipments, our pre-existing steel mills achieved a record shipment level this year. Imports, as a percentage of domestic consumption, increased from 23% in 2013 to 28% in '14. Despite this wave of additional material, domestic steel production utilization remained generally unchanged between 77% and 78%. This depicts the increasing demand for steel and the growing domestic economy as new steel companies produce roughly the same amount of steel while domestic consumers were also buying large quantities of foreign products. While these challenges created highly competitive market conditions, our employees performed exceptionally well, driving financial metrics that, again, were at the top of our peer group. The addition of premium rails to our product portfolio positions us to become the preeminent rail supplier in North America. And nearly all the Class 1 railroads have qualified our premium rail, and we're receiving great quality reviews. And the capability to weld 320-foot length rail versus the conventional 80-foot rail gives us a strong competitive advantage. It provides our customers with a high-quality product at 75% fewer welds. This improves the safety by significantly reducing the number of potential failure points. The longer rails also save our customers money by reducing maintenance cost and installation time. We continue to believe domestic rail consumption will increase during the next 3 to 5 years as both replacement and new rail are required, based on railroad investment forecast, which, we believe, are still substantively intact despite the recent energy declines. In addition to what's still needed for the shale industry, the growth in the U.S. economy related to other sectors will still demand new rail investment as well as the continued need for replacement maintenance rail. We plan to increase our rail shipments alongside this growth, and I told our rail customers that we are committed to this market and are targeting at least 300,000 tons annually. This enhances our profitability through both product margin expansion as rail elicits a better profit margin than structural steels and also cost compression through increased volume. Our capital investment was $26 million and continue to expect that project payback will occur within 2 years. Rail shipments increased 8% over 2013 as we shipped 220,000 tons of rail. We expect to see further improvements in both volume and a higher proportion of premium rail in 2015. Commissioning of our engineered bar capacity addition is also complete. The new rolling mill is performing well and producing high-quality products. We continue to receive positive customer feedback and appreciate our customers' continued loyalty and support during our expansion. We're confident that our trusted customer relationships built on quality and on-time delivery will allow us to increase our market share to fully utilize the added 325,000 tons of capacity in the coming years. The annual domestic SBQ market is generally about 8 million to 10 million tons. Out of that, small-diameters bars represent about 55%. So we don't believe our market share expectations are unreasonable. Our capital investment was $95 million. Based on current results, we believe the project -- payback will occur within that 2 years, as we expected. We shipped 647,000 tons from our engineered bar division last year, an increase of over 30% from 2013 levels. We expect to increase that amount again in 2015 with further improvements in both volume and product mix based on our increased capacity, anticipated demand and market share growth. It's also becoming more obvious that acquiring the Columbus mill was an incredible opportunity for Steel Dynamics. Creating a single flat roll group provides us a platform to fully utilize our core competencies. It's allowing us to develop strong relationships with our existing and new customers, maximizing the logistical benefits, broadening our steel ship product capabilities through width, gauge and strength diversity. They're complementing our current product portfolio with further exposure to high-growth markets, and we're also diversifying geographically into the Southeastern, U.S. and Mexican regions. Leveraging synergies across 2 highly efficient flat roll steel mills and 8 coating lines provides us a unique opportunity to significantly increase value for all our stakeholders. The fourth quarter is particularly challenging, though, for our metals recycling business. Our overall shipments in both ferrous and nonferrous materials decreased as did our operating income. Nonetheless, the symbiotic relationship between our recycling operations and steel mills allows us to have lower average input costs, as compared to our peers. Through November 2014, ferrous scrap exports were about 16% lower than the prior year. Export scrap lows have actually fallen in the past 2 consecutive years, with volumes significantly lower than recent historical norms. The continued significant overcapacity of shredders, particularly in the Southeast in the U.S., impends volatility and continues to constrain margin as processes are all competing for the same material. Although the ferrous market has remained essentially flat the last 3 months, the reduced export pressure, additional imports, ample scrap flow and the recent softening of mill utilization is causing a substantial supply overhang, with the likely result that the scrap market -- and I coined a rust run phase [ph] -- that the scrap market will hit a reset button in February and March and will bring scrap closer to its historical relationship to iron ore. Regarding Minnesota. Theresa discussed the fourth quarter impairment charge, and I'll now update you on the operations. The team actually has truly made great progress. During the fourth quarter, their operating performance reached a steady state, indicating consistency of production capability. We still believe the cost structure will ultimately be in the $340 to $350, maybe $360 per metric ton range. In order to do this, volumes must reach 32,000 metric tons per month or 360,000 metric tons annually. During the fourth quarter, our average monthly production was just under 28,000 metric tons, which is a solid footing, I think, to further ramp up the volume to that 32,000 a month. We also see the need to install equipment for the iron ore retrieval process. In the third quarter, we described the need to install scavenger equipment to improve yield, and that is -- and that it would be installed in November. However, the equipment was delayed at the ports, and we only now just receiving it. The plan is to install and commission it before the end of March. This should bring our cost to line come straight back to the level established in 2013, which is under $50 per metric ton. The cost was higher in the second half of 2014 due to lower recovery rate resulting from finer-sized tailings in the current base. But had we been at the $50 cost level during the fourth quarter, excluding the impairment charge, we would have actually been cash positive. The good news, we're producing nuggets at a steady pace. Unfortunately, as a result of the steady production, both steel mill utilization in December and January and transportation issues relative to bringing the nuggets down from Minnesota in the October to November, December period, we've had an overhang of volume of nuggets. So in order to correct the inventory situation and to allow the iron recovery equipment to be installed and commissioned to generate lower cost concentrate, we intend to warm idle the nugget production facility for some 6 to 8 weeks starting at some point during the first quarter. This will allow us to bring inventory production and cost to a better alignment. After several years of challenge, the fabrication platform had an absolute blowout year. Chris and the team did a phenomenal job both financially and operationally. Our fabrication operations hit the trifecta : achieving record annual shipments, record operating income of $52 million, and the highest level of market share. Industry utilization continues to improve, and it is certainly true for us. Based on sustainable increased demand and market share improvement, we've added production shifts at several of our plants, employing additional people in our communities. According to the Steel Joist Institute, the year-over-year domestic joist shipments increased 21%. Our annual joist shipments increased over 38%. The team continues to perform exceedingly well both in market share advancement and leveraging our national footprint. It is a credit to the foresight and positioning work of the team over the past several years. Regarding the macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence recently surged to its highest level since 2007 as labor statistics improved and people saw significantly lower prices at the gas pump. Durable goods and nonresidential investment each grew in 2014, both key measures concerning continued strength in U.S. steel consumption. Consumer spending also improved in the quarter. Forecast for the 2 key steel consuming end markets, automotive and construction, remain intact. Automotive could grow to almost 18 million units over the next couple of years. Overall construction spending continues to trend favorably. Despite fourth quarter seasonality, construction spending actually edged down about 0.3%. Manufacturing remains solid, and our customers are reporting that they remain busy and are forecasting growth through 2015, affirming positive market fundamentals. That being said, we have 2 current headwinds : one, the deteriorating energy market; but more importantly, imports. Firstly, energy. With the growth of shale now comprising -- the growth of shale actually makes the OCTG goods consumption around by 10% of our domestic demand. With the shock, that drop in oil price, OCTG consumption has fallen with rig count. Inventory is being reduced throughout the supply chain, and imports of both scrap and pipe are still on the system. The associated reduced demand has had a marginal effect on the Butler sheet mill as only a small percentage of these shipments are energy related. At Columbus, however, approximately 20% of the shipments were related to energy products, such as OCTG and line pipe, and they are seeing a greater impact. If you look at us, company-wide, exposure to energy markets approximates 8% in our steel business. We will further diversify the product mix of Columbus through 2015 and into 2016 so that we can move from market-to-market to optimize return. There are many reviews concerning the time line for recovering oil prices, but the constant is that oil pricing cycle is up and down. And it's inevitable that stronger pricing will return. It's just a question of when. Past cycles have demonstrated a return, about 70% of the prior peak, after approximately 12 months from that peak, thereby suggesting recovery beginnings in Q2 of this year. Imports had a second wind. I would suggest the most important headwind. While domestic demand remains robust, global economies are battling slow and inconsistent growth, resulting in weak global steel consumption. Global overcapacity, strong dollar and low raw material costs have been driving a historically wide price disparity between U.S. and foreign mills, and unfair trading practice only continue to compound the problem. Although now receding with the recent erosion in domestic pricing, the large price spread drove imports to a peak of 11.4 million tons in Q4 and were a near record 43.1 million tons for the year, a historical high of 28% of total demand. The combination of seasonally lower demand and elevated imports resulted in increased customer inventories, particularly for our distributors, and consequently decreased selling prices. We believe this overhang can be resolved in the first quarter 2015, with customers reportedly coming back to the market in strength in March. However, this has had a dramatic effect on our order entry late in the quarter, with mills throwing back production to match their respective order books, and this has continued into January. The associated low mill utilization, ample scrap flow and subdued export market will likely result in a drop in scrap pricing in the coming months. Anticipation of lower scrap pricing has already helped erode hot-band price, reducing the spread to levels that will begin to dissipate the attraction of imports. However, as the inventory overhang subsides, the underlying market demand will give support to product pricing while scrap trends lower towards historical relationship with iron ore. As raw material prices decline, the price support will provide opportunity for improved margin. In short, the first quarter may be challenging as the markets find themselves, but we believe the fundamentals are supportive of strong economic growth in 2015. We believe the current global growth expectations, combined with global production overcapacity, will be a headwind to steel pricing for the foreseeable future, but as raw material prices reset sharply, there's a margin expansion opportunity. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we continue to focus on the opportunities that maximize our financial performance. We believe our superior operating and financial performance clearly demonstrate the sustainability of our business model throughout the market cycle. We're focused on providing exceptional value to our customers, committing to the highest levels of quality and timeliness, conquering them to create value and deliver what they need today and anticipating what they're going to be needing tomorrow. As we look ahead, we continue to be optimistic regarding our future. Columbus is one aspect of our story and our organic growth projects that are beginning to benefit our operations, now another. We believe we're fully equipped to take advantage of new opportunities that lay ahead. Our resolve to maintaining a differentiated growth company that effectively and efficiently performs through all market environments is unwavering. We believe our superior operating culture, best-in-class performance through the market cycle and the strength of our financial performance provides clear evidence of a successful business model and a differentiation to our peers. The strong character and fortitude of our employees, I believe, are unmatched. Their dedication to our customers and passion for excellence compel us to achieve highest standards of performance, and I thank each one for their hard work and dedication and remind them that safety is always the first priority. So again, thank you, everyone, for your time today. And Kevin, we'd like to open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Brett Levy from Jefferies. Brett M. Levy - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research : It sounds like things are kind of slow in January and maybe slow in February. Can you give a little detail around that and just sort of give a sense, kind of order book by product in that sort of sense? Mark D. Millett: Okay. Well, again, if you look at demand, I think that the -- just sort of the overview. The strong import level and the fact that mill utilization haven't really ticked down [ph]. I think it just emphasizes that the underlying market fundamentals, underlying demand is absolutely there. And as I spent time with our customers -- I've been doing a lot of that the last 3 weeks. They certainly are busy, they are confident and they express growth through 2015. And depending on who you ask, they're looking at a 5% to 10% growth. Again, as we said before, not a hockey stick but slow incremental growth and demand, and I think things support that. And that's supported by the growing factory activity. If you look at the truck and tonnage volumes, they tend to be -- continue to grow and almost at record levels. Manufacturing is solid. Automotive is incredibly strong. And I think importantly, nonresidential construction, which I emphasize -- it's probably 40% of the steel market. It continues to show growth. Fabricators are busy particularly on the commercial side, and I think the -- and I've said it before. The visibility of our joist business into that market is a clear signal, and Chris continues to facilitate -- perform there. Chris, do you want to give some -- a look on that? Christopher A. Graham: Yes. I think that some of the things that we should take note of, our backlog as of December 31, Mark, was the highest year-end backlog, full size and value in our company's history. Our customers continue to be bullish regarding demand and in 2015, and as usual, I think our team is well positioned to successfully compete for that business. We see a lot of variety in the type of work we do, which is always good, from small things to big box to institutional, and indications are that, that will continue. Mark D. Millett: And I think the -- if you look at the softness, end of the last quarter and going into January and it's probably going into February, again, I think it was a combination of a strong import level. And that arrived at the distributors -- it started coming through in the supply chain and strength at the end of the quarter just as a little bit of seasonality, the tip of winter, the seasonally hit. So service centers, inventories have certainly grown, and that people just took their foot off the older -- or the sort of accelerator. I think people have also been anticipating this drop in scrap. And so people are -- they're kind of trying to readjust, tightening their inventories. They're buying currently on an as-needed basis just to fill holes, and I think it's the overhang -- that supply overhang subsides with the good demand, we'll start to see the order rate pick up in the latter part of the first quarter into the second half. If you look at our backlogs -- again, I don't want to paint an absolutely bleak picture, the Butler hot-band backlogs are around, I think, 3 weeks or so and finished -- it's around about 4, so would not in a bad shape. It's just volumes will be off quarter-over-quarter. I think Columbus is ahead or a little bit harder. They're closer to the import scenario given the Southern proximity, and they've got a slightly higher energy exposure than Butler. In total, Columbus' exposure is around about 20%, and so that's seeing a little greater impact, I think, with, yes, the Butler sheet mill. Christopher A. Graham: Mark, again, fabrication, as we discussed on previous calls that they would stand to reason that as we continue to approach more historical norms, we see the effect of seasonality become more visible again. We've seen a little bit of seasonality in Indiana and Virginia. If their backlogs remain at all-time high -- an all-time high for this time of year. More positive news would be -- while the Northern plants, we've seen -- there's a seasonal slowing. Or entry [ph], our plant serving in Southeast and Southwest continue their -- book new work in a pace that bars any seasonal effect. And again, our expanded geographic footprint continues to pay dividends, as we mentioned. Mark D. Millett: And just a couple of other markets. I guess, the truck trailer, material handling markets, are strong. I think that's a reflection of the large amount of freight being shipped around the country. In fact, the FCR, which puts estimates for the trailer manufacturer, actually swung. They revised their negative 6% for 2015 and actually now at positive 6%. So again, I think that tends to be positive for industry, but it's also a signal that the economy really is -- has got good demand out there. A couple of areas that we do see softness, off-road equipment, the mining, the Caterpillars, the John Deeres. They're a little light. That's impacted the engineered bar to a small degree. And then obviously, as I mentioned earlier, energy is -- affecting us all. But I think the -- our optimism is that American pricing has eroded, and it's eroded, in all honesty, a little more than you would see from plants in CRU data. And so -- whereas in November and December, the price disparity between Indiana or Midwest delivered pricing and China port pricing was a couple of hundred dollars. That is eroding dramatically. And one has to also remember you have freight expense to get it from China to here. You've got to insurance and other things. Probably, there's a $40 or $50 additional cost to get it to our ports. If we get it to the Midwest, there's another $40 or $45. And as I've said before, our Butler mill has a little insulation more so than, perhaps, some of our peers close to the ports. So that erosion of our spread, I think it's going to dissipate the attraction of import orders. And with demand where it is today, I think there is going to be a lesser -- the change in pricing relative to scrap movement. Brett M. Levy - Jefferies LLC, Fixed Income Research : And then the follow-up is in the context of the weak environment. You guys have a strong balance sheet. Can you guys talk a little bit about sort of trade cases? And then also about, perhaps, what geographies and product areas might be interesting from the standpoint of acquisition? Mark D. Millett: Well, as far as trade, I don't think there's been any dramatic change. Obviously, there are cheating [ph] unfair trading practices or there and currency manipulation that is compounding the import pressure. The termination of the price suspension, duties on Russian imports should be a positive for the industry -- sorry, for Columbus. As you know, the Korean OCTG was successful and that the line pipe filing against Korea and Turkey -- they comprise, I think, about 60%, 70% of the imported line pipe, had a sort of a positive commentary back in Thanksgiving -- around Thanksgiving time. And we hope that will be successful. That will be a big case. That not only impacts the import line pipe, but obviously, scalps [ph] suppliers such as ourselves, to that industry. What has been done on the corrosion resistant products, it remains to be seen, the timing of any action there. So again, no massive change in the trade picture at least from my perspective. Obviously, companies are -- don't always work through a-- They're also doing their own things. So I can't speak for them. Relative to acquisitions, as you can see, of late, folks are sort of throwing back some of their facilities, which has helping the industry in general. The elimination of -- or the reduction in [indiscernible] up in Chicago in the bar front is going to help, I think, our Pittsboro SBQ order book. And U.S. is rationalizing their facilities. I think that's a sign that everyone is looking inwardly at their portfolios, their asset base and see what is core and what is not. And that will provide the opportunity in the months and the year ahead for potential acquisition activity. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Luke Folta from Jefferies. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just as a follow-up to that, I guess 2 questions on line pipes. I think you're selling to some line pipe producers out of Columbus. Just curious to know if that market is seeing the same sort of weakness as we're seeing in OCTG. And also, I recall speaking with you not too long ago about the potential to -- that there could be interesting opportunities maybe in the line pipe business for steel and have it [ph] at some point in the future, at least something that have been thought about. So just any update in terms of your thinking around that would be interesting. Mark D. Millett: Well, I think that the larger line pipe consumers that we supply recognize the softness. They clearly recognize that energy and oil goes down and it comes back up, and they don't believe there's any paradigm shift that's going to hold oil down for a prolonged period of time. So longer term, I think they're optimistic. Obviously, they're drawing back their consumption in the near future. Recognize that Columbus -- as I said, we've got about 20% exposure there. In the past, that was higher, but I -- we're back to 30% into pipes and tubes, but some of that -- or a good portion of that is actually sort of water transmission, other types of line pipe, not necessarily structural, mechanical tubing, those sorts of things. It's not all energy. So only 20% of the mill is exposed there. Relative to -- I'm not clear as to what you were getting at, to be honest, in the second part of the question, but we have tended to stay away from competing from our customers. And so we're not actively pursuing, simply getting into the ERW line pipe business. Luke Folta - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. That answers my question. And secondly, on SBQ, just some energy leverage there as well. I mean, you mentioned some weakness on the ag side. I think that the expectation was that it's -- throughout the course of this year that you could potentially ramp that mill, the expansion, to roughly full. Is that something that you still think is possible for this year? Mark D. Millett: I think it's -- I'm not sure I ever said we'll be totally full in 2015, perhaps I did, but I think it -- I'm reasonably confident that we can get up to the 75% utilization, which should be meaningful growth year-over-year. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Brian Yu from Citi. Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Mark, on Columbus, you guys have gotten the energy exposure down 20. I think it was actually closer to 40 in the acquisitions slide. Is that 20% level where you guys are comfortable with in terms of -- over the cycle, with the diversification, that's where you want it? Or do you plan to take that lower as you break into new market? Mark D. Millett: Okay. Well, just for clarity, on the acquisitions slide, that referred to 2013 volumes, and that 40% was not just energy. As I said, it was also order transmission line pipe, structural tubing, that sort of thing. With the growth in shipments at Columbus over 2014, the total pipe and tube exposure is probably about 30%, and that -- actually, total shipment supply went up because we had much greater volume. The actual percentage, each stand at 30%. And as I said, pure energy, OCTG, energy line pipe is -- remains about 20% today. And I would suggest that it's probably a good level for us, but I think we fully intend on diversifying the product portfolio at Columbus. And that will allow us to shift from market-to-market to optimize returns depending on the profitability of the different sectors. That being said, we have no intent of deserting the energy markets, and I wouldn't want anyone to take that away. That's going to be a robust market for us going forward. The energy down tick, I do believe, is temporary. It's just a matter of when it returns. Brian Yu - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then second question on the fabrication business, that seemed to be doing well. Can you give us a sense of how much of that, the business there, has in -- locked in pricing? And the reason why I asked is, we are seeing prices coming down on the steel side, and I'm wondering if you might see some margin expansion there. And then maybe part B of that is, how much of that is supplied internally by you guys? So essentially, awash versus what you purchased externally. Mark D. Millett: Chris, do you want to take that? Christopher A. Graham: We would tell you that it's a fairly small portion of our business that's locked in for any length of time. That approach seems to work best for our customers and for ourselves, so really negligible, Mark. If there's opportunity one way or the other, we'll tend to have to work through that quarter-by-quarter basis. We have worked. It's kind of locked in for 12 typical life cycle, maybe 12 or 13 weeks, and we would expect that pricing to remain strong there. And that'd be great. We've taken the approach of buying the steel in normalized -- in normal times from the source that best serves that plant's needs as opposed to any subsidies or anything you have to talk about buying all internally. We tend to ask the mill to fill up and what's best for their mill and their customers and new millennium what's best for new millennium. Ultimately then, what's best for the corporation is the result. But we do buy a large amount of steel from our sister mills. Theresa is asking me what percentage. I'd say 65% is probably inside. That fluctuates. It's been higher. It's been lower. Operator : Your next question today comes from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : My question, I guess, 2 of them. Could you just talk a little bit about scrap prices, which appear to be a little bit higher versus published prices? And if you could just talk about the discrepancy and again, where you see scrap prices going and by what timing? Russel B. Rinn: Scrap prices, I think, again, are impacted by global issues, exchange rates policy. And as we see our customer base in the marketplace, they're all faced with the same issues that our own mills are faced with, and that's the threat of imports that has grown exponentially therefore affecting their worth. At the same time, we don't have the ability -- or the scrap industry has lost the ability to competitively export because of the strong dollar and their -- the pricing level. So I think, as I see the reset button, it's going to have to get to a point where some of those exports come back. And where it gives our mills -- our old mills, the U.S. Mills industry, an opportunity to compete with foreign competition to some degree. And that's not dollar for dollar, it's not ounce for ounce, but it is just a global market situation. And again, economics are going to drive it. Mark D. Millett: Would it be correct, Russ, to say that the last year or so, iron ore -- iron concentrate has come down very strong dramatically. And scrap, because of the export pressure -- no, not pressure, but to the export level, has remained a little sticky and this is the -- a point of reset, where that ratio gets real static? Russel B. Rinn: Back in the normal -- normal ratios. That's correct. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. Got it. And just maybe a question for Theresa. What is the remaining carrying value of the nugget facility at this time? Theresa E. Wagler: We actually prefer not to talk about that. We would tell you that what's left in Minnesota from a material value perspective is what we believe is the fair value of the asset. And that includes all 3 of the facilities. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : So can I ask if your write down equated to 50% of the value? Theresa E. Wagler: If I did that, you're smart enough to back into some sort of number, aren't you? Operator : Our next question today is coming from Matt Murphy from UBS. Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Another question just on the internal sales. On the scrap side, OmniSource provides the scrap to Columbus, right? Russel B. Rinn: Some amount of it but as we do with all mills, we supply some amount internally and a significant portion externally. Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. Yes, because I was just looking at intercompany sales. I thought they might pick up relative -- maybe external shipments of scrap going down. But maybe that's just an accounting thing as opposed to an actual cost savings for you guys? Russel B. Rinn: This, as Chris talked about it, it's a market-driven situation. And again, you're looking -- scrap, in large part, is -- will flow to its logical freight haul creating such a big issue of all scrap that, again, the distance will make a difference to some degree. Matthew Murphy - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got it. Okay, and then just on the effort over time to diversify the product mix at Columbus, just wondering if you can give some color on how long that takes, how nimble you can be in the short term if we see energy de-stocking continuing to weigh heavily there? Just my estimate is Columbus around like 82% capacity utilization right now? And is there a possibility to improve that notwithstanding weak energy? Mark D. Millett: I think, as we stated, that we're confident of diversifying the mix there based on our existing customer relationships. There's certainly a great deal of room to improve on the value add downstream. Because I think I also said in the past, that it's -- that's not a near term next week type of deal. It's going to work through 2015 and into 2016. Operator : Your next question today comes from Evan Kurtz from Morgan Stanley. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : My first question is on the Mesabi. So you talked a little bit about how scrap is moving down because of iron ore and currency, and I think it's probably fair to argue that pig iron would as well. And we've seen a little bit of a decline in pig iron but it also seems to be a bit sticky. And these numbers you gave you us, kind of, 340 to 360 on cost per metric ton, right now, you can eke out a little bit of profits but certainly, if pig iron falls anymore, I assume you price off of pig iron, it might be a cash neutral, maybe even a cash loss type of an operation. Would you ever consider shutting down the nugget plant? I know that Magnetation's pelletizing facility is online, so there's probably a market out there right now for concentrate and turning that into a cash positive operation, if that where the scenario would unfold? Mark D. Millett: Well, I think our position is -- well, the reality is on Q4, as we suggested, would concentrate at a $50 number, we would have been at cash breakeven, even at the 28,000 tons or 27,000-ton a month rate, that being based on the pig iron market over the last 2 or 3 months. As we edge up and ramp up the production level, again, we feel confident -- or pretty confident that we can get to that 350-ish cost basis. So the future then lies on as one views the market. To your point, pig iron has remained somewhat sticky the last year. Even -- well, the last couple of last years. Even when scrap has gone down dramatically, it seems to have stayed at that kind of 380-ish NOLA number, 390. And I think time will see, over the next couple of months, where the market plays out then. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then maybe just one more follow-up on scrap. You talked a little bit about the historical relationship between iron ore and scrap. Would you -- what you think that relationship would yield as far as if it took a -- low 60s iron ore price, what does that actually mean for the U.S. price for scrap? And then just maybe a second part of that, we're all hearing about this big leg down in scrap that were -- could get here in February. How long does that take to actually flow through your numbers on FIFO? How much inventory do you have on the ground? And would that help the first quarter? Theresa E. Wagler: As far as within what we have on the ground from a scrap perspective, we tend to always add and keep about 3 or 4 weeks on the steel side, and so that tends to be -- the way we factor it and the way you should model it, the 1 month lag. So what you buying in one month, you kind of get the benefit in, in the following month. And regarding the relationship between iron ore and scrap, I'll let Mark or Russ talk to that one. Mark D. Millett: Right. Again, historically, just on a simple ratio, is in the 3x to 4x ore. So if you take 70 -- I know it's $65, but let's just take $70 times 4, you're at a 280-, 300-dollar number. And there are periods last year, there was this more in the 5x to even 6x range. So I think, getting back to that 3x to 4x range is a realistic expectation. I've always been a great believer, the markets -- they're uncanny. They just have an efficiency to balance themselves over time, and I don't think there's been a paradigm shift that -- on a sustained basis, we can't get back to that ratio. I think the support or the stickiness of the export level, and for whatever it was, Russ, 3, 4 years, there at 22 million tons, 24 million tons, that's 25% of the metallics market roughly. That's dissipated dramatically. And I think things will return back to normal. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I don't want to mess up this philosophical discussion of scraps, I have one question on that and I'll move on to something else. On the scrap side, you made a comment that with scrap falling, you could see margins expand. I don't know that, that's happened historically. So I was just wondered if you were talking about some sort of outside scrap move relative to steel? Or if you were talking about how you've improved your underlying margins and that's where the expansion comes from? Or a little of both? Mark D. Millett: No, I guess, it's just looking at the general market pricing. The spread. Our headwind is certainly imports going forward. The import pressure is going to remain. Low below the capacity, it's going to be there for some time. The strength of the dollar, in our mind, is going to be there for some time. So the driver of the level of imports will purely be the price differential between domestic pricing and global pricing. As I said earlier, November, December, the spread, and people keep talking about a $200 spread, it's a little disingenuous because you've got -- that's the spread between Midwest delivered versus China port, and you've got to get it here, you've got to insure the cargo and not only do you have to get it to the U.S. port, you've got to get it to the Midwest. So the $200 spread, so to speak, is -- kind of amplifies the motion of it all. But nonetheless, the increased inventory level, the import level, the lower mill utilization, that is eroded -- and the anticipation of a lower scrap price has eroded domestic pricing a little more than what you might think from Platts and CRU. And that spread now between domestic pricing and Asian or European imports have dissipated dramatically and the attraction or the discount there is going to dissipate, in my belief, our customers' appetite to bring foreign steel in. So you've got that -- you're going to have a little bit of a price support there. Secondly, inventories are pretty strong right now, people don't have the capacity to bring a great deal foreign import in. And you've got underlying strong demand. So surprising, in our belief, is will it drift down a little bit? Perhaps it does. But there are some support there. On the other hand, scrap is, Russ coined the phrase, We think it's at a reset point. And so for the next couple of months, could see an adjustment there more so but then product price -- and that's where we sort of imply or infer there's the opportunity of margin expansion, even in kind of a strange market dynamic that we see ourselves today. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. So steel is overshot, scrap has yet to adjust, and that can be the margin expansion? Mark D. Millett: That could be. Yes. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then you guys have actually been importing scrap, from what I understand, into Columbus. How much of that can you capitalize on it with a strong dollar environment? Is that just a marginal strategy or is that a real opportunity going forward? Mark D. Millett: I know -- Russ, you may know better than I, but actual scrap import, I think, is minimal. Russel B. Rinn: Very minimal. Mark D. Millett: Obviously, we're bringing in pig iron. Russel B. Rinn: Pig iron, correct. Mark D. Millett: And that's a larger percentage. Timna Tanners - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got you. Okay, last question, I just thought it was interesting that you were pretty decisive about the weakness and the near-term being finalized in Q1. I'm just wondering if there was something specific that was giving you that impression or is it just your timing of imports or the inventory draw down or just if you could give some color on why Q1 will be -- will contain all this weakness and then you Q2 can rebound. Mark D. Millett: Well, I guess, it's just color more from our customers than anything else, Timna. It obviously depend on the level of imports in January, February and March. If they maintain their November, December level, maybe gets pushed into the second quarter. But the anticipation, again, because of that -- the price differential erosion, the -- I think some folks' expectation, is the import level will start to edge back and the underlying demand will pick up the slack. Operator : Your next question today comes from Michael Gambardella from JPMorgan. Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I just want to ask you a question on, when scrap hits this so-called reset button and drops down maybe $40, $45, $55 or something like that, get it back into relationship with iron ore. Have you, at Steel Dynamics, balanced that situation in terms of price versus market share grab? Mark D. Millett: On the -- when you say market share grab, you're talking about our market share of the scrap annex [ph] flow? Or are you -- Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Well, just between sheet market, not in the bar market. And long products, everyone has the same scrap advantage, disadvantage, whatever, because everything is bought, produced using scrap. But in the sheet business, it's basically you and new corner, the other smaller players account for about 1/3 of the supplies of domestic sheet are made from scrap and if you get a reset down in your scrap cost for 1/3 of market supply, there's an opportunity for you and the other scrap-based sheet guys to take some market share in that environment, specially down at Mississippi, where you got 20%, 30% is -- of your demand is being impacted by the drop in oil. So my question is, how do you balance that situation or opportunity between taking more share from your iron ore-based competitors, who are not going to see a reduction in cost, and this scrap reset happen, and your ability to capture that scrap cost drop, you take some share and maybe take a little price as well. Mark D. Millett: I guess, I think that it'll happen naturally as opposed to us sitting around the table and deliberating and saying, \"Hey, we're going to get 2% or 3% or 5% or whatever.\" I think naturally, we're going to be in a better position and the natural -- the last few months, the -- our integrated brethren certainly have had, at least on the hot metal side, a huge advantage. Nonetheless, even with that -- and even with that advantage, our efficiencies downstream are incredible and we still make up for that deficit, so to speak. But if there is this reset, obviously, we'll be in a better competitive position, and I think you'll see that our utilization rates, as been demonstrated in the past, will be higher than industry peers. Michael F. Gambardella - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : In the past, years ago, many mills in the sheet business would basically run at capacity to capture whatever volume they could. Do you anticipate running near capacity when you get this scrap reset? In the sheet side? Mark D. Millett: I would suggest that we will, as we do every day and every month, attempt to do so. I think the market dynamic is a little more complicated than that, and we will be in a more competitive position to get our mills up at full rate. Yes. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Tony Rizzuto from Cowen and Company. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : A couple of questions here. My first question, just to drill down a little bit further on Columbus, no pun intended there. But we're hearing some very aggressive behavior by another mill in the area. You probably see the oil comments and what's going on in that market. I'm wondering about the import congestion. Has that eased to the extent you're seeing import flows more easily into the South East and the Mexican market? And how is this making your job to reposition that mix, how is that affecting that process? Mark D. Millett: Sure. You want to take that? Chris, just to add, there was information. Chris Graham here is -- was given the task of integrating Columbus, is doing a phenomenal job along with the team down there. So you want to give some color there? Christopher A. Graham: Yes, I think, as Mark started out, we think the impact of the price of oil is going to be lesser than people may have thought, because of the lowering exposure, someone mentioned earlier that the mills was at 80% capacity. The folks at Columbus might say that they believe they have taken it to a higher percentage than that since they achieved over 3 million tons last year. But they recognize, as we do, the extra width and the opportunities of that -- or the capabilities of that mill, that there is some room there. So irrespective of some these headwinds, there are opportunities in certain construction products may not capitalize on certain value added mix down there. To Mark's point, we would -- no plans to desert anyone. We will add customers by pushing the envelope and even in the last 3 months, we've already expended daily capacity through bringing some of our best practices to bear there. We don't do a lot in the coated products. We don't do a lot of pickle and oil. Those opportunities are out there and that can allow us to affect ore rates as well as diversity almost irrespective of whatever noise is going on outside of those markets. Mark D. Millett: I want to be clear though that Columbus right in the -- or the month of January isn't running at 80%, 85%. If February and March return, then perhaps for the quarter we could get that. But it is being impacted by both the energy and by imports. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just to -- and then follow up on scrap, what do you guys think will happen to scrap flows when the reset occurs? Russel B. Rinn: Tony, I think that certainly, there will be some impact to it, again, it will slow to some degree. Again, until the export market starts coming back up being meaningful part of it, there's plenty of scrap around in the system. So yes, there will be some slowing down. Again, a different price level brings up different levels of scrap. But in the end, until we get to a point where exports are a viable alternative or a more viable alternative, the flows or the availability of scrap is still in oversupply in the United States. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And Russ, I have heard that one of your competitors is maybe sourcing some scrap from Canada and Europe. Are you guys also? Russel B. Rinn: Well, we look at everything, Tony, as it applies to how we support our customers in our mills. And so we do have -- on the case, I think, we talked a little bit earlier, we have had opportunistically taken advantage of some of those opportunities. So we look at everything. Again, that's part of our business is to deliver the best low cost scrap to our customers. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : All right. and I just wanted to ask this question, if I may. I heard, obviously, you're talking about different factors affecting the market. And, I think, Mark, you brought up about the OCTG case with South Korea. And interestingly, at least what we're seeing so far, maybe we're not looking at the data correctly, but it doesn't really look as if the South Koreans have really turned down or taken their foot off the gas pedal. And I'm wondering, has the devaluation of South Korean won offset the relatively modest tariffs that were set against OCTG from that country? Mark D. Millett: Again, haven't looked it at that level of detail either to be honest. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Nathan Littlewood from Credit Suisse. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just had a question on your fabrication business. Obviously, a fantastic result there. You did mention in your commentary that you had added a couple of more shifts. But I was wondering if there was anything incremental you might be able to tell us about the sort of capacity of that business? How much scope is there to sort of scale things up further? And how much further could you take the tonnage of that business in the assumption that the demand for it exists, which certainly seems to be the case. Christopher A. Graham: We are, from an infrastructure standpoint, positioned to probably build every joist necessary in the United States. As our other joist suppliers, the regional and the effective freight tends to limit how many shifts one can run in that particular region and not be in a cycle of up and down with employee headcount and doing things we like not to do. So we're running on one shift basically. Our market share has continued to grow 5 consecutive years now. I think that we're not the only one with late capacity. But I think we're as positioned as well, if not better than most, to continue to take -- to be looked upon to service large parts of increase in market, and in demand. So I guess, you can say we've been at -- we could double or triple the number of production crews but that's not it, we're not a steel miller on 24/7. But we have a lot of search capacity and I think that the suppliers in our industry, in general, are ready for a lot of growth and maybe we more so than most. Mark D. Millett: And I think the -- our market share has grown to 38% or thereabouts of the market, right, Chris? Christopher A. Graham: Yes. Mark D. Millett: And again, there's kind of a natural freight-regulated sort of volume for the players in that business. I don't necessarily see that we will have any great change in market share going forward. But obviously, that industry continues to grow on a volume basis and also on a margin basis. Theresa E. Wagler: And the thing I would add is that there is additional margin expansion capability, both through lower raw material costs with the support of higher pricing given the high demand, but also incremental volume going through the New Millennium facilities is exponential to the margin because the cost compression, it's just pretty astounding how volume impact their margins. And there's margin -- I would -- Chris, I also put words in your mouth, the margins can expand from where they are today. Christopher A. Graham: Absolutely. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And I guess, on that same thing, Theresa, if we do get this sort of scrap price collapse that everyone is talking about here, and we've already seen the weakness in steel prices, could you talk a little bit about how pricing works for that steel fabrication business? Are customers immediately going to turn around and require you to pass those raw material cost reductions onto them? Or is there some sort of delay with respect to the way contracts work there? Christopher A. Graham: Well, I think that -- the good thing for our customer base is that they're able to price things in such a way as to reflect current situations, were able to procure materials as necessary without much speculation. And so everybody understands the rules of engagement. Day to day that can change. The one thing that might provide some price support is that the market and the capacity of the providers. We're running at a very high utilization rate as the joist industry now, maybe as high as anybody can remember, ever, because of some of the changes in companies entering and leaving the industry. So as construction deadlines loom, lead times will stretch a bit. We have that capacity previously mentioned so we can still take the work. But lead times tend to offer a good support, when they get extended, the way you expedite it is to do it for a price -- provide a service for a price. It does tend to buoy the pricing even if other drivers would tell you it would go other way. Demand is going to be a big lever for one side or the other in our industry. Nathan Littlewood - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. Much helpful. I just had one final one on Columbus. At the time of acquisition, you talked about some interesting opportunities there with respect to changing product mix and also scrap procurement. Obviously, there's been some new term headwinds that you already spoken about with respect to the ore price. So maybe the product mix thing -- side of things is not quite there. But how are you going with the opportunities that you've spoken about earlier with respect to scrap procurement? Mark D. Millett: Well, let me just speak a little broader, perhaps for the conference integration [ph], as a whole. The team down there demonstrated a record level of production. Well, total shipments were close to 3.2 million tons, of which though about 138,000 tons were imported Russian band. The good news there is that mill is never going to import Russian band again in the future, I guess. So total shipments from the actual mill itself were around about 3 million tons. I think very, very gratifying is that if you exclude the -- without questions of canning, the LTM [ph] cash was about $306 million. This clearly demonstrates its earnings power. Theresa E. Wagler: That's EBITDA. Mark D. Millett: EBITDA, yes, without the synergies. And I think you speak of the synergies that we suggested some $30 million and from everything we see, that those are going to be achievable over the next 18 months. Not just in diversifying the product mix, we spoke of that earlier. That's not going to happen overnight. It will certainly occur over the next -- about 2015 going into 2016. I think the teams have done an incredible job in working together and sort of we have a plane that goes down, takes a group of our folks down from Butler and it takes a group of the Columbus folks back up to Butler. And so there's a very, very rapid sharing of best practices, I would tell you, both sides. It's not just from Butler to Columbus. I think it's occurring with a strong benefit to both mills. And it's not just on production or sort of technical issues, it's across the sphere of finance and just everything we do in business. The mill is being challenged. They are challenging themselves now that they see what the Butler mill can do relative to the gauge with the nice strength, which is going to allow us to broaden the product portfolio near term into high strength quality light gauge materials that's been a benefit to Butler over the years. And the learning curve on the coating and the pickling side at Columbus, I think, is rapid and will continue to be rapid. And those -- it's been interesting, once you get into the numbers and we talk together. They had quite a -- or they had a much higher exposure to coaters and to pickle products in the past, and unfortunately, there's been -- the past teams and some quality issues, and we lost a little bit of credibility there. I think that and working together, they are solving these problems -- those issues, and we'll gain that market share back, I think. It's a very, very positive down there. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Mark, can you balance your SBQ growth comments that you made earlier with the slowing in mining and energy? Because I know a lot of those markets are served by the SBQ piece. Mark D. Millett: The off road Cat business, again, that's not just the slowing over the last 4 weeks or a 1.5 months, that was in place through the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year. There's not a meaningful downtick to their order book sort of from segmental last year to this year. Energy is being impacted but -- and I think it's running about 15%, 20%. Theresa E. Wagler: No, no, no. It's well less than 10%. Mark D. Millett: Less than 10%? Okay. We've got one customer in particular there that their business, for whatever reason, is remaining a little sticky. I would say the engineered bar, in general, their order input rate is a little light. Again, people are picking holes in the inventory. It's just sort of a readjustment, I think, by everyone there. But we don't have any -- we are not losing any sleep over an implosion in their utilization -- the utilization, their backlog is reasonable right now. And once we are now getting out of the holidays, we're getting back -- all industry is getting back to work, those orders and lead times will extend. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And Mark, what's the longer-term potential within the company for the current and long-term potential to be a player in exposed auto? Mark D. Millett: Our focus, currently, is not necessarily exposed. If you look at our Butler facility, right, 32%, 30% of their output is going into auto applications, nonexposed. And the focus is not to grow their automotive share dramatically but grow Columbus' share. I think they were about 2% or 3% auto last year in 2014. We are focused on emulating kind of the Butler's role model down there and pushing that auto percentage up to whatever, 10% or thereabouts, over the next year or so. We've actually put on a team of how many divisions we have? Six or seven, I think. Folks that we brought on from Dearborn, quite capable people in the automotive world, and they are making some progress with BMW and VW and the folks in that piece relative to qualifying products and getting some business. Philip Ross Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Thanks, Mark. And Theresa, can you just provide us the mix as you typically do for the sheet business? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes. Phil, I'm actually going to, at commercial perspective, going to combine both Columbus and Flat Roll, and were going to be a little more summary in the level. For hot-rolled and P&O, in the fourth quarter, we shipped 916,000 tons. For cold-rolled, we shipped 95,000 tons, and then for all other coated products, which include painted, Galvalume and galvanized, we shipped 447,000 tons, for a total of 1.5 million tons. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrew Lane from Morningstar. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Regarding effective imports, could you provide some color as to which product lines across your portfolio have been subject to more displacement than others as import volumes have risen? Any specifics would be interesting to hear. Mark D. Millett: I think hot-band, in general, has been an issue. And I think our -- what's frustrating, our product is light gauge, which tends to be sort of as a stock building material, that standard width, standard gauges, the Galvalume. So that has impacted the Jeffersonville facility. Andrew Lane - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then with respect to the energy end market, could you provide just a rough estimate as to the sequential percentage decrease you expect in shipment volumes going in the first quarter? Would it roughly track the decrease of the U.S. rig count? Or do you think your energy-related volumes would deviate from that baseline? Mark D. Millett: Given that we're only about 3 weeks into to the quarter, I have not necessarily looked to that, to be honest. Theresa E. Wagler: I guess, I'd reiterate. As a company -- from a company perspective, and if you look at our steel-making capabilities, we're only about 8% in total specifically energy-related. So it's not -- I think we need to keep that in mind. And no, I don't think you should look at rig count and try to correlate that to our volume. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Aldo Mazzaferro from Macquarie Securities. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : I have 2 questions. One, I think, pretty straightforward, you mentioned right upfront you had 7,700 workers at this point now. Would you be able to break those into the 3 big buckets of mills, recycling and fab? Do we have a little feeling for that? Mark D. Millett: Let Theresa take a look at that. I've got numbers in my mind but I don't want to give you wrong numbers. So let's go to the second and we'll get back to that. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Right. You don't happen to remember how many people you added at Columbus though, right? Mark D. Millett: Columbus was 600 people or thereabouts? Russel B. Rinn: 650. Mark D. Millett: 650, Aldo, was the addition. Theresa E. Wagler: And Aldo, for steel, we have about 3,700 people; in mills recycling, we have about 2,300 people; and fabrication, we have about 1,200 people; and then the remainder, even though I wish they were corporate, they're not. A few corporate but they're mostly the JVs. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Right. Okay. And my second question, Mark, is a little bit philosophical again. Nucor came out and said they expect scrap to fall. But I'm just wondering, have you heard any good reasons in the marketplace from a supply and demand perspective why that would happen? Because I'm just thinking that the strength in the dollar, I think, was the major driver on what happened in steel and scrap, I think, since around the early part of December and I'm wondering if you see anything else that changed that maybe drove scrap higher than it normally would be? Or something that you see that might change that would drive scrap down all of a sudden. Mark D. Millett: It's like, again, I think out of the price support for why scrap remains sticky relative to ore coming back is principally the export market. And if you consider that exports reach 22, 24 million tons against the metallics, general metallics market of whatever, 85 million tons, there's a time when 25% or 30% of scrap was going offshore. That had a major -- or was a major driver to keep pricing up, in my humble opinion. That has dropped dramatically with the relative currency, Turkey and folks can buy cheaper in Europe and from Russia than they can from our shores. So we would surmise that the export market is going to -- is coming down and will stay down. You couple that with reasonable inventories gone into the fourth quarter, quite a downtick in utilization at the end of the fourth quarter going into January. Ample flow. I mean the weather has not been -- not been bad, it's been a little gray around here, but the scrap keeps flowing. And you're actually getting scrap imported today at a much higher level than ever before. So if the -- I think you've got a sort of a perfect storm. Demand has dropped off dramatically and supply isn't as strong. And that imbalance is, I think, going to reset that market. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : That all makes a lot of sense, except I wonder why it hasn't happened yet. Mark D. Millett: Well, we felt the same so -- sometimes you've got to be patient, though. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : Well, it feels like Nucor is just saying, \"Hey, you guys at OmniSource better cut the price to us and we're not going to cut steel prices and everything resets and margins get better.\" I don't know. Mark D. Millett: Sorry, Aldo, we totally lost that last commentary. Aldo J. Mazzaferro - Macquarie Research : I was just saying it's funny how Nucor suggest that that's going to fall when they're really kind of saying that OmniSource is going to cut price to us and they're not going to give it back on steel price. But -- Mark D. Millett: I'm not so sure what they've said. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Charles Bradford from Bradford Research. Charles A. Bradford - Bradford Research, Inc.: Please, don't take this as a forecast. One of your competitors published some data showing that the relationship between shred and iron ore for the last 10 years has been about 0.8. And based on their analysis, although the data that's been presented, shred should be about $250. However, if you do shred versus WTI oil, the correlation is 0.93, and that would drive the shred price to less than $200. Now the -- that has lots of ramifications like maybe a $400 hot-band. But also, shred relates a lot to what the shredders are willing to pay for the bodies. And if they drive down, if shred were to go and it was near these kind of prices presumably, the price that shredders will pay will drop dramatically and the bodies won't show up. Is there an equilibrium in there some place? Mark D. Millett: I think -- and I'll let Russ -- Russel, this one, answer after me. But I think you're right, the floor of scraps will obviously be set by the flow of obsolete common to the yards. Scrap has been elastic. I'm not so sure it's so elastic that you're going to down to $200 a ton. But I think there's substantial room to move from where it is today and where it has been in the fourth quarter. Russel B. Rinn: So I would tell you that, again, I think there is -- there does become a point where economics will come into place from the collection standpoint. In other words, you get to a point, where it is not economically viable for the dealers or the peddlers or those guys to collect scrap and sell it, because they can't make a return. So again, I thought the economics will drive what that is. So again, mathematics could tell you it's going to get here or get there, but I think in the end, it's going to be those market dynamics that are going to set that low. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any final and closing remarks. Mark D. Millett: Well, I just would like to thank all those that's still on the line. Thank you for your support and your interest in our company. To our customers, we will continue to -- and I continue to commit to you that we will try and create greater value for all of us. And to our employees, thanks, guys and girls, for doing a phenomenal job. We are the best in the industry, you demonstrate it clearly, and just be safe right there. Thank you, all. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. Have a great and safe day.",

And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you Marlene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It\u2019s certainly been an interesting first quarter of 2015, some significant industry shifts have taken place that were fundamental for the domestic steel community, and I believe others are still occurring. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Theresa, for a few comments, before providing thoughts on these industry and market dynamics, and how Steel Dynamics is positioned for both near and longer term opportunities within the landscape. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. To begin, just a quick note regarding the format of our supplemental data this quarter, based on questions concerning the reconciliation of operating income and the calculation of adjusted EBITDA, we\u2019ve modified the format for clarifications and additional transparency. You should be able to still find all of the data previously provided. Our first quarter results were negatively impacted by the continuing challenges related to excessive steel in the quarter, and significant scrap price volatility, which were the meaningful decreases in domestic steel pricing and shipments. Excluding $17 million or $0.04 per diluted share call premium and other finance expenses associated with the March senior note repayment, our first quarter 2015 adjusted net income was $40 million or $0.17 per diluted share, which is above our adjusted guidance of between $0.12 and $0.16. This compares to sequential adjusted fourth quarter 2014 net income of $97 million or $0.40 per diluted share. Including the finance charges, first quarter reported GAAP net income was $31 million or $0.13 per diluted share. First quarter 2015 consolidated revenues were $2 billion, 19% lower than the sequential fourth quarter. As a result, operating income was $100 million compared to adjusted fourth quarter results of $179 million, a decline of 44%. Decreased steel volume and pricing drove the decrease in operating income, most impactful within our flat roll group. Steel imports and scrap price volatility created a challenging operating environment. For the third quarter, steel shipments decreased 381,000 tons to 1.9 million tons, a 16% decrease compared to the fourth quarter. Metal spread also contracted as the cost of scrap used in the first quarter declined $34 per ton, while our average steel sales price fell $43 per ton. The full benefit of lower scrap prices was not fully realized in the first quarter as we first used the higher priced scrap in inventory because of our FIFO accounting. Additionally, with lower production rates, the timeframe to use existing raw material inventory was longer than our typical one month lag. We will realize the benefit of lower price scrap in the upcoming second quarter. For our metals recycling platform, ferrous shipments decreased 7% in the first quarter as domestic steel mill utilization declined and metal spread also contracted as selling prices decreased between 25% and 30%. Non-ferrous shipments also declined about 10%. As a result, our metals recycling operations recorded a slight loss in the first quarter as operating income decreased $3 million sequentially. A much different story for our fabrication operations. The positive momentum continued into the first quarter. Despite the expected seasonal decrease in volumes, operating income improved to $189 per ton compared to $159 per ton in the fourth quarter, a $30 improvement. As a result, first quarter 2015 operating income from our fabrication platform was $21.4 million, well below the record $21.7 million achieved last quarter. We continued to see improvements in underlying, non-residential construction demand, good news all around as the construction sector is also the largest domestic steel consumer. During the first quarter of 2015, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $235 million, operational working capital provided $93 million, as inventory and customer account value declined. First quarter capital investments totaled $33 million. We still estimate annual 2015 capital expenditures to be between $150 million and $175 million, number could increase as we proceed through the year and evaluate new growth projects. As mentioned earlier, in March we repaid our $350 million, 7.625% senior notes, which were due in 2020. They were our highest coupon debt. We incurred $70 million of finance costs, which are reflected in other expenses on the income statement. This debt reduction results in annual interest savings of $27 million. We also increased our cash dividends to shareholders by 20% in the first quarter. This follows increases of 5% in the first quarter of 2014, and 10% in the first quarter of 2013, demonstrating evidence of the continuing confidence of our board of directors in the strength of our cash generation capability, financial position, and optimism concerning our future. Throughout market cycles, our operating performance generated strong cash flow, based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations. Combined with our strong cash flow performance, even after deleveraging our balance sheet and increasing shareholder dividend, our resulting liquidity at March 31, 2015 was more than $1.3 billion. Total debt decreased 12% to $2.65 billion, while net debt decreased 6% to 2.5 billion. Coupled with pro forma trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA at just over $1 billion, net leverage decreased to 2.4 times. Our credit profile is already aligned with our preferred recycle net leverage of less than 3 times, a testament to our disciplined approach to growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook is very flexible. We don\u2019t have any near term meaningful maturities and those in the longer term are well laddered and have call flexibility. Looking forward, we believe that our capital structure and credit profile has a flexibility to not only sustain current operations but to support additional growth investments. Mark Millett : Super. Thanks, Theresa. Well, nothing is more important than creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Safety is at the forefront at Steel Dynamics, same thing goes to everything we do, so it\u2019s also where we\u2019ll start our conversation today. Our safety performance continues to be better than industry averages. Our goal remains squarely as zero safety incident work environment. Our companywide recordable incident rate improved in the first quarter with 70% of our locations having no recordable incidents. I congratulate all those that work in those divisions. We continued implementing new initiatives and reinforcing others to drive toward our goal. In that regard, we\u2019re excited about the creation of a companywide core safety group to enhance our grand philosophy, to that expectations and ensure best practices are being implemented across all our work groups. We\u2019ve high expectations. We\u2019ve positive impact from an even greater collaborative safety effort. Operationally, the team has performed well in a very challenging environment. As predicted in January, steel input levels remained high, the lower scrap and raw material prices led to steel product pricing to decline to globally competitive levels, which we believe will result in decreased steel import activity in the coming months. Sustained first quarter 2015, steel import levels combined with an existing customer inventory overhang drove domestic steel mill utilization to less than 70%. Our steel operations operated at [indiscernible] of utilization, still ahead of the industry as shipments declined 16%. Flat roll is definitely the hardest hit, and our flat roll shipments declining 20% in the quarter. While our company wide exposure to the energy sector approximates only 8%, it is higher to our recently acquired Columbus flat rolls steel mill, which was particularly impacted by both imports and reduced energy sector steel consumption. In 2014, approximately 40% of Columbus\u2019s product mix related to the steel tubular business, but which about half was tied to the energy sector. In 2014, imports represented almost 60% of due domestic steel tubular consumption. And during the first quarter 2015, imports of the goods increased again almost 50%. As you may recall, our first order business upon closing the Columbus purchase was of further market and product diversification. Moving toward a greater number of customer relationships and a broader mix of value-added product lines serving more industries. Unfortunately, it\u2019s really nice to have a strong energy market last a little longer within which to accomplish this task. But that being said teams are making tremendous progress in automotive from construction related products, as well as utilizing the benefit of existing SDI customer relationships. We\u2019re also making good progress [indiscernible] Mexican export opportunities but as we had previously stated these market shifts do take time. In the interim, we continue to improve Columbus\u2019s operating costs and product quality capabilities. We will further diversify the product mix of Columbus through 2015 and into 2016 to provide a commercial flexibility existing at our other steel mills in order to mute market volatility and optimize financial return. It is still abundantly clear to us that acquiring the Columbus mill was an incredible opportunity for Steel Dynamics. Leveraging synergies across two highly efficient flat roll steel mills and eight coating lines provides us a unique opportunity to significantly increase value for all our stakeholders. In addition, creating a single flat roll group provides us a platform probably utilize our core competencies, allowing us to develop stronger customer relationships, maximizing logistical efficiencies and savings, grown our product capabilities through the gauge and strength diversity and diverse via geographically into the Southern U.S. and Mexican regions to further increase exposure to high growth markets. Overall while it\u2019s still challenges created turbulent environment, all of our employees performed well in the first quarter, driving operational and financial metrics that were again one of our peer group. Our most significant recent organic projects are great examples of SDI employed performance. The addition of premium rail to our product portfolio allows us to become the preeminent rail supplier in North America. Both the domestic Class I railroads have qualified our premium rail and we\u2019re setting shipping records for [indiscernible] rail. We\u2019re receiving great quality reviews. The capability to weld 320-foot rail length versus the conventional 80-foot rail, gives us a strong competitive advantage. It provides our customers with a high quality product that has 75% fewer welds. This improves safety by significantly reducing the number of potential failure points. And the longer rails also save our customers money by reducing maintenance costs and installation time. We believe domestic rail consumption will increase during the next three years to five years based on railroad investment forecasts, which we believe are still substantively intact despite the energy decline. Additionally, the growth in other sectors would also demand both new rail investment and replacement of rail. We\u2019re committed to this market, and are still targeting 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons annually. First quarter 2015, total rail shipments were slightly higher than the fourth quarter, while the portion of premium rail increased over 20 --. We expect to see further improvements in both volume and a higher proportion of premium rail through the year. The product and capacity expansion within our engineered special bar quality operations also continues to ramp up and show good benefit. The SBQ markets have been less robust in the large diameter sizes for the last several months. And our ability to now produce smaller diameter bars has provided product diversification, and an important support to mill utilization. The annual domestic SBQ market is typically consumed about 8 million tons to 10 million tons, of which smaller diameter bars have historically represented about 50% or 55% of that market. So, we don\u2019t believe our market share expectations have an additional 325,000 tons is unreasonable. The first quarter was particularly challenging for our metals recycling business. As we suggested in January, lower steel mill utilization, combined with ample scrap flow and subdued export activity resulted in a dramatic drop in scrap pricing during the first quarter. Prime scrap fell approximately $110 per gross ton in the quarter, while obsolete grades dropped approximately 85% - $85. Interestingly, strong prime scrap generation provided excess availability reversing the typical $10 to $15 per ton premium generally gone for this grade. Export scrap levels have fallen in the past two consecutive years to volumes significantly lower than recent historical norms. The continued significant overcapacity of shredders, particularly in the southeastern U.S., continues to compound volatility and continues to constrain margin as processors are all competing for the same material. We reported a slight operating loss as rapidly decreasing ferrous and non-ferrous prices contracted metal spread and shipments decline. We expect both scrap volume and margins to improve in the second quarter as domestic steel mill utilization is expected to improve and scrap price volatility to abate. Nonetheless, a symbiotic relationship between our recycling operations and steel mills allows us to have a lower average input costs as compared to our peers. Regarding our Minnesota operations, as discussed on our January conference call, nugget facility was idled in February to reduce companywide iron nugget inventory and to install equipment in the iron concentrated facility in order to reestablish product yield. As planned, the iron concentrated equipment was installed and product yield has shown significant improvement. When operated at full capacity, concentrated cost would return to $750 per metric ton delivered to the nugget plant. From a broader raw material view, imported pig iron pricing has decreased significantly in the past several weeks, sourced mostly from Russia. And it\u2019s currently at levels below our expected iron nugget cash cost of $340 to $350 per metric ton. Given the unexpected [indiscernible] decline and non-traditional source of the imported material, which is typically sourced from Brazil. We\u2019re assessing the longevity of this pricing erosion, and in the meantime, I know - trustworthy will remain in an idle state, at least until a review with our Board of Directors in May. The fabrication platform continues to achieve strong operational financial performance. Chris, and the team did a phenomenal job. Our first quarter financial performance is only $340,000 less than our fourth quarter record results. And that\u2019s during the first quarter, which is seasonally the slowest construction quarter of the year due to the impact of winter weather. According to the Steel Joist Institute, year-over-year domestic joist shipments increased over 20% in 2014 as we gained market share, and our shipments increased over 38%. The team continues to perform exceedingly well both in market share advancement, and leveraging our national footprint. It is a credit to the foresight and positioning work of the team over the past several years. Based on sustainable increase demand and market share gain, we have added production shifts at several of our plants, creating more jobs in our local communities. The strength for this business provides a key window into the strength of nonresidential construction activity. The steel market is at an interesting point. The U.S. has strong demand dynamics in place. Consumer confidence is expanding - continuing to improve boosted by significantly lower prices of gas pump and bullish equity markets. Durable goods and construction investment continue to grow both key measures of U.S. steel consumption. Forecast for the two largest domestic steel consuming sectors, automotive and construction, remain intact. Automotive is forecasted to grow to almost 18 million units over the next few years. Overall construction spending and domestic manufacturing continues to trend favorably. Most importantly, our customers reforming positive market fundamentals. However, the excessive levels of steel imports and lower seasonal demand dynamic, combined with high inventory levels and scrap price volatility has caused an uncertainty for the consumer so, they are waiting. As the inventory overhang subsides in the coming months, the underlying market demand should give support to steel product pricing. Scrap flow remains good and the strength as well will continue to compete in the export markets. So, the new strong drivers for scrap price appreciation. We therefore expect raw material pricing to remain somewhat stable at current levels. In short, the second quarter 2015 may continue to be challenging, as the market finds themselves. But we believe the fundamentals are supportive of the stronger economic growth this year. We believe the current global growth expectations, combined with global production over capacity would certainly be an industry headwind of steel pricing, but as raw material prices remain at lower levels, there is margin expansion opportunity later in the year. Additionally, in order to insulate ourselves from imports, part of our strategy is not only to develop strong customer relationships but to also manufacture products that are more able to compete with, on a global basis so such as our plain and flat steel, highly engineered SBQ steel, and longer life rail. As such we were able to mitigate some of the import impact, and maintain [indiscernible] mill utilization rates, when compared to our peer group. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we are focusing on opportunities to maximize our financial performance. Our superior operating and financial performance clearly demonstrates the sustainability of our business model, we\u2019re at the market cycle. We\u2019re focused on providing exceptional value to our customers, committing to the highest levels of quality and timeliness, partnering with them to create value and do what they need today and anticipating what they will need for tomorrow. As we look ahead, we continue to be optimistic regarding our future. Yes, Columbus is one aspect of our story and our organic growth project\u2019s another. And we believe we are also fully prepared to take advantage of new opportunities that lay ahead. The strong character and determination of our employees are unmatched. The dedication to customers and passion for excellence compels us as a management team to the high standards of performance. I thank each one of them and remind them safety is always the top priority. And again, thank you everyone for your time today. So Manny, we would love to receive calls from our audience. Question-and- Answer Sessio : Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Luke Folta of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Luke Folta : Nice work this quarter. Mark Millett : Good morning, Luke. Thank you. Luke Folta : I think first question, I was hoping to discuss Mesabi a bit. You had, you talked about the cost structure being in the $340, $350 range as you had said previously. If we operate under the assumption that iron ore prices stay where they are for a while and pig iron prices stay below $300 a ton and ultimately the project becomes uneconomical. I mean from a longer term perspective I guess how important is it to have a scrap substitute source, to the extent, I mean there\u2019s likely things you could do to improve Mesabi, but if we just assume for a second there is an, do we - should we expect later on that you might be making investment perhaps into your iron, and something that could bring you an internal source? Mark Millett : Well, I think, Luke our perspective on DRI in particular is one that still, we have problem returning or having a good return through the cycle that there will be good times perhaps, but it\u2019s not a technology that we want to invest in. Yeah, it may give you iron units at the current market price, but it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t believe, it\u2019s going to return you a great deal of money on your investment. Regarding the Mesabi nugget, selling with the recent drop in iron ore costs along with the strengthening dollar, pig iron pricing decreased significantly recently. It\u2019s only pierced the level of the price support for the last several years, 360, probably 380 has been a floor for pig iron. And it certainly has pierced that and currently they ran about 260, 270, 275 in the Netherlands, but certainly below our cash cost nugget. The sourcing has changed although for Brazil, it\u2019s been our principal importing partner so to speak. But that has changed, Russia seems to be the predominant supplier today. And I\u2019m not so sure how long that will last, obviously the valuation of the Ruble, and then iron ore costs is - makes it very attractive for them to bring it in today. But we\u2019re just accessing the longevity of the current pricing environment. And as I said, we continue to review, discuss it at our board meeting in May. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll make the prudent decision as we go forward. Theresa Wagler : Luke, I would add that, I wouldn\u2019t want you to forget that we do have Iron Dynamics, which has been producing around 250,000 metric tons of pig iron for the Flat Roll Division in Butler, which is very important to their productivity. So, we do have an additional iron source as well. Luke Folta : If you wanted to keep Mesabi on a long-term idle to maybe a couple year idle, if that\u2019s the way it turned out and perhaps turned out at a later point, if needed. Is that something that you could do? Mark Millett : Certainly, yes, obviously- this spectrum of options, we\u2019re evaluating them all. Luke Folta : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tony Rizzuto of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Anthony Rizzuto : Thanks, very much. Hi, everyone. Mark Millett : Good morning. Anthony Rizzuto : Hi, Mark. I got a couple questions here. First, on the service center side, would service centers support a price cycle right now in your opinion? Mark Millett : I believe that there is opportunity for upward price movement as inventories subside. Obviously, the - you\u2019ve got a period of excess inventory overhang today. I do believe pricing has overcorrected as mills have struggled to retain an adequate backlog. The import discount today is significantly below the $100 to $150 per ton, but it has taken for customers to take a speculative risk for import volume. So, I think naturally, as the inventory level does subside, and I think it is - if you look at our order profile, people are coming to us with large orders today, and they are prompt orders. Those are signs we\u2019ve seen in the past that inventories are sort of are getting holes, and becoming more imbalanced. As that inventory level subsides, I expect naturally the market can absorb a price increase. Anthony Rizzuto : Okay. So just to confirm, you guys are seeing improving orders, so inquiries clearly picking up, orders picking up, where would you see your lead times? Have they begun to extend then at this point? Mark Millett : Well, they are extending from some pretty horrific levels. Anthony Rizzuto : Right. Mark Millett : But nonetheless, the order input rate at both Butler and Columbus picked up quite significantly. Unidentified Participant : Yeah. We had - at Columbus, we had the two best weeks since September and we see it continuing, we believe. Mark Millett : Yeah. Obviously pricing still is under pressure, but it\u2019s the first time. Anthony Rizzuto : Okay. Good, good. And just a quick follow-up on the Mesabi, then one other question with me. On Mesabi, are you - is it totally written down now at this stage? Theresa Wagler : So, we\u2019ve valued the Minnesota operations, Tony together. And at the end of December, we felt like we had it down to the fair value, and I would suggest that the nugget facility itself has been written down substantively. Anthony Rizzuto : Okay. All right, great. And just on Columbus, so the recent uptick in oil price, has that benefited you guys there? And if you can bring us up to-date with the mix shift in synergies, if you could provide some granularity, perhaps percentage improvement based on what you\u2019re kind of targeting in terms of goals there for the mix shift and synergies? Mark Millett : Yeah. I think the recent uptick in oil price is certainly directionally the right thing to have in first. Again, in that space, you\u2019ve got a massive inventory overhang that needs to dissipate, and you also have a considerable input volume. But with time we\u2019ll turn that market around, and I think later in the year, and it\u2019s going to take some time for that inventory to dissipate down. Unidentified Participant : To very much, to very much so. You\u2019re right. Mark Millett : Okay. Unidentified Participant : Again, to try to give you a little granularity, it\u2019s difficult to do, because we\u2019ve really been pushing new products, we\u2019ve been pushing expansion into automotive and into other applications and which are new for SDI, but we\u2019re begun under the Severstal [ph] reign and now being developed in a more fully fashion. So it\u2019s a pretty much across the board, we\u2019re very pleased with the receptance, we\u2019ve improved the pickling performance, as well as coal rolling and galvanizing, and those in turn are giving us opportunities to go back to customers that we may have failed in the past. And so those aren\u2019t necessarily new products, but they are headway into a market that we\u2019ve been absent from for a little while. Anthony Rizzuto : Could you guys give us any sense of where you were operating Columbus at during the quarter? Theresa Wagler : Yeah, so from a year-to-date perspective Columbus was just under the 70%. Anthony Rizzuto : Okay. All right, Theresa. Thanks very much. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you. Mark Millett : Oh, just Tony just, you did ask about the synergy update? Anthony Rizzuto : Oh, yeah, yes, please. Thank you. Mark Millett : I would suggest that they are working quite well on the cost compression. Certainly, just recently, I think the team renegotiate with the power contract down there that will bring savings, and on the customer front diversifying the product mix, a new steel team, I think has done incredibly good job penetrating BMW, BW and the Ford, late to pick up potential opportunity there. Unidentified Participant : And I guess, all I\u2019d say is that, I think we\u2019ve turn the corner in the beginning of the reestablishing our relationships with our customers that are down in the region, but there\u2019ve been customer of Butler, and not being fully utilized from a Columbus perspective, and those relationships are being warmed up, and hopefully bearing fruit. Mark Millett : We still have an incredible excitement there. Yeah again as I said earlier, it\u2019s really unfortunate that the energy in market didn\u2019t last a year, but they - we\u2019ve been challenged before, and we\u2019ll survive this one too. Anthony Rizzuto : Sounds like a good progress is being made. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Kurtz : Hey good morning, guys. Mark Millett : Good morning, Evan. Evan Kurtz : There is a question on the metal spreads. You mentioned that in February, we have this big scrap move down, but you\u2019re not really going to see any of the benefit of that until we get into the second quarter here just given the inventories, and in the FIFO accounting. So, how should we think about the second quarter, steel prices have also edged down a bit over the past couple of months obviously. So, would you actually expect at this point to see FIFO metal margin expansion in the second quarter or flat or how should we think about that? Mark Millett : I think, Evan, it\u2019s a little too early to tell because again lead times are or backlogs aren\u2019t stretched out into May or June as yet. We\u2019ll certainly see on the sheet side the benefit of scrap move as that inventory, high priced inventory got consumed in March and April and lower price stuff gets consumed later in the quarter. I would suggest that our fine values, particularly with Butler they have been historically, have been above the general market. And again, that pricing has come off as we come closer to market and maintain a backlog. So, we anticipate some margin expansion, it\u2019s difficult to quantify like this one. Evan Kurtz : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then I know you guys don\u2019t drive the bus on these things, but any thoughts on the Potential Trade Case and we keep reading about potential timing there? Mark Millett : Dick? Dick Teets : Yeah. Okay. I guess I\u2019d say that everyone recognizes and hence why the conversation is there that I think between 2013 and 2014 imports increased much under 40% and year-over-year in the first quarter and many products increased another 30% or more. And hence that\u2019s why the focus has been on it. But the industry including SDI continues research on trade cases and we\u2019ll file the cases when the industry\u2019s Legal Counsel believes the timing is right, when there is unfair trade in the form of both dumping and or subsidies can be demonstrated. And so we\u2019re - we\u2019re working on things, we have our counsels communicating amongst interested parties of participation. And we\u2019re - we\u2019re focused on. Evan Kurtz : Okay. And then maybe just one last one, you kind of hinted at or didn\u2019t hint, you mentioned that you got a new power contract on Columbus. Just given the weak energy markets out there, could you maybe try to quantify a little bit, what sort of benefit you might see this year from not just Columbus, but your power costs as cost of spectrum? Dick Teets : Well, I guess that\u2019s - that\u2019d be a tough one to quantify that the contract that Mark was referring to is really a follow up to the original contract that Columbus had under prior owners and some of the programs were coming to a completion here this spring. And so what we negotiated, it was a not an extension, a new power contract, but with slightly better performance, but it\u2019s slightly, it\u2019s not going to make a huge impact, but it\u2019s still that we look for every of opportunity to be executed on. As far as other energies meaning natural gas, that we consume around that company we have hedges in place just about everywhere, again varying levels based on the strength of their backlogs and order books. One or two locations that do not have hedging opportunities based on their tariff and the contract arrangements. But we\u2019re comfortable at each of those that they\u2019re, they\u2019re constantly looking at energy efficiency opportunity. So I think it\u2019d be very hard to quantify. Theresa Wagler : And then just as a reminder, natural gas is about 3% to 4% of our manufacturing costs and then electricity tends to be closer to 67%. Evan Kurtz : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. I\u2019ll hand it over guys. Thanks so much. Mark Millett : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gordon Johnson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Gordon Johnson : Thanks for taking my question guys. I just wanted to piggy back on the trade case comment. We\u2019ve had some recent discussions with people in Washington and they told us that there\u2019s two different dynamics being discussed now. One is overall legislation with respect to getting, I guess, awaited the ITC and the DOC looks at the trade case and then as the official trade case. And what heard is that, I guess attacking both of those things at the same time could be somewhat tough. So the different legal I guess entities looking at these are looking to wait to increase the strength of the trade case. Can you guys comment on that? And then I have another follow-up. Mark Millett : Well, I guess all I say is that needless to say current legislation as it moves through Congress is being watched whether it would be TPA or TPP. I guess we are independently pursuing lobbying in a manner that is a responsible through our elected officials on those issues. And we\u2019re also supportive of potential legislation whether it would be through an independent move or an addendum to another build that\u2019s there for the modifications of the injury calculations. Again tragically it takes a catastrophic collapse on industry\u2019s part whether it\u2019d be steel or any to really do the terminations and so we\u2019re looking for different definitions to be used from an injury calculation standpoint but I can assure you that we are not resting on our laurels looking at filing trade cases on many other different products that are being under siege in the steel community. Gordon Johnson : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, lastly just again on the trade case, we\u2019ve heard that from some industry specialist said steel companies - certain steel companies need to report two quarters of losses. This doesn\u2019t seem to be a static rule but have you guys heard these same comments and do you think that\u2019s accurate or do you think now a trade case could be filed? And thanks again for the questions. Mark Millett : Well, as I said no timetable has been determined. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a written rule that\u2019s talk about two quarters of losses. It has to do with performance needless to say negative performance is - what is looked at and the magnitude of that. And so, sometimes it occurs in a longer period and sometimes it\u2019s very quick and dynamic. And so, each and everyone has looked at independently. Gordon Johnson : Thanks again. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matt Murphy of UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Murphy : Good morning. Theresa, you mentioned the potential that some growth opportunities could be considered that push up your CapEx this year. Just wondering if you can provide some thoughts on what some of the considerations are? Theresa Wagler : Well, there\u2019s several different projects that we have that we\u2019re looking at internally and will announce those and talk about those when we get to a point in price where we\u2019re ready to execute but I just think it could possibly push up the CapEx later this year as this projects get approved. Matt Murphy : Okay. And I guess on the fabrication segment, it\u2019s good to see such a strong result in Q1, and I was a bit surprised how much, how well you did on pricing, just wondering how sustainable that price is? And is that something moved up as steel prices recover or it will be determined just based on demand within fabrication? Mark Millett : Thanks for the question. I think that the demand capacity relationship is such that, there is no flow that\u2019s going to fall off from under us, if steel prices increase, I believe we\u2019ve been able to move those along through the supply chain. Things are just very well positioned at the moment in our industry. And we should be able to react to, whichever direction things are at. Matt Murphy : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. JorgeBeristain: Hi, good morning guys. Mark Millett : Good morning. Jorge Beristain : I just wanted to get back to the cost, input cost, and just again are you guys currently profitable at your other raw material supply in terms of iron ore? Mark Millett : I guess we - the only iron facility we have were Iron Dynamics. Jorge Beristain : Yes, Iron Dynamics, right. Are you guys currently profitable there, I\u2019m just trying to understand, Theresa had mentioned that you\u2019re still getting supply there about few hundred thousand tons a year. And so, is that sort of an independent profit making unit right now or is that indirectly also being subsidized? Mark Millett : Well, it\u2019s certainly not being subsidized, the transfer pricing is based on pig iron pricing essentially. You also have to remember that - pig iron go into the electric arc furnace which adds substantial both the cost and productivity advantage. So iron dynamics is integral into the productivity, and the cost structure of Butler, but under itself, it\u2019s still a profitable entity. Jorge Beristain : Okay. And then at Mesabi, could you comment if, you said, you\u2019re going to have a board review decision there. But roughly assuming current iron ore prices hold flat, and you\u2019re able to import, you said from Russia, it sounds like below that operating cost. If you were to idle that facility for a longer term or do a full shut down there, what kind of EBITDA cost savings would that generate and versus the current market environment on an annual basis? Mark Millett : Yeah, I\u2019d prefer to wait until we have that review in May, and make a final decision and we\u2019ll let you know the details. Jorge Beristain : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Timna Beth Tanners : Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone. Mark Millett : Good morning, Timna. Timna Beth Tanners : Both Theresa and Mark talked about the capacity, and the balance sheet to pursue opportunities ahead. And so, I just wanted to get your latest thinking on M&A opportunities in the space. So I know it\u2019s probably a broad question, but to be a little more specific. There is a lot of financially stressed scrap companies or shredders and may be some fabricators and service centers, so just wanted to get your broad comments on kind of where, what end markets or what products, what type of opportunities you might start to look at? Mark Millett : Okay. Well, as we discussed, and I think, as you look into our results, we had an incredible quarter even as challenging as it was and kind of cash generation was quite dramatic and again sort of a testament to our operating model, a low cost structure, highly variable cost and the team is just doing a phenomenal job. And we expect that strong cash generation to continue in any event in any market. You saw that we increased our dividend 20% in the first quarter, again I think that\u2019s testament to, where we see the future of that cash generation, certainly the confidence, I am more confident in our performance and continued performance. So far as sort of cash allocation beyond that, we do feel that there are some small organic projects that we can still leverage and then also as you indicated, there\u2019re going to be acquisition opportunities, I think going forward. Our focus, I would suggest is not in scrap in any great way. Obviously, that industry, as we\u2019ve suggested in the last 12 months is about to go into a shakeout and I think we\u2019re on the doorstep of that - there is a lot of financial stress throughout scrap organizations everywhere we look. I don\u2019t believe that we will be in part of that shake out in a larger way. I think our focus seems to be downstream, and still make inside of our business, for sure, where we can get a value-add opportunity and increase the quality of our margin. And now, New Millennium is executed on its growth path, done an incredible job. I think it was a couple of years ago, Chris when we -- after we both see, we repositioned that business, had a lot of management sort of change to fill that up. His charge - his teams charge was to go execute, that they done so. And I believe there might be opportunities that we can also give them support. Timna Beth Tanners : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I just want to also ask a little bit a general question about, it\u2019s been the best times, the worst of times in terms of flat roll pricing over the last 12 months where we had a really steady price level about $200 a ton higher in current spot market, now we\u2019re at these depths that you say you know we\u2019re creating a over corrected. But do you think that as prices recovered, do you think the mills are going to be more mindful of the import offers, given the strong dollar going forward or do you think they\u2019re just going to look at the domestic market in their lead time still independent of the import environment? Mark Millett : Well, and I do would say yes. They would be mindful of the relative pricing between domestic and global markets. The human nature and capitalism tends to get away from here - from time-to-time. I don\u2019t believe, we will see pricing spreads get up to the $200, I think it was $230 a ton that back in -- look forward over the last year. I think there\u2019s every opportunities to expand margin though. Again, I do believe pricing is over corrected as mills have chased the backlog. The spread between domestic global pricing has dissipated dramatically today, it\u2019s certainly way below the $100 and $150 premium that or discount that attracts an inflow of ton. And I also think that the whole utilization obviously there has been less fixed cost absorption at the mills. So, as we go forward, as pricing sort of rebalances, as we pick up more volume, the fixed cost per ton will increase. And so, there is certainly margin expansion opportunity with a stable scrap market. Timna Beth Tanners : Okay. Thanks for your answer. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Matthew Korn of Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn : Hey, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. It looks like we\u2019re all waiting for the same inflection point right now, but beyond this turn in the cycle, should we be bridged, should we expect to return to this kind of challenging quarter regularly until we see substantial capacity largely in China taking offline, with scrap lower, iron ore lower, coking coal taking a leg down. Do you have concern that another turn of lower input costs spins the wheel again until it reached the point where there has been enough pain to bring the global supply demand into better balance, maybe that\u2019s happening now, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m looking for your thoughts there? Mark Millett : Well, it\u2019s difficult to see that raw material costs go much lower with oil pricing like it\u2019s come up a little bit here in the last week or two. But $50, $55, I would suggest is certainly - certainly a flow. And scrap pricing, I believe has reached to the flow, and level of stability. As Russ indicated in the last call, that the reset button has certainly been pushed and I believe the scrap arena, the recycling world is realizing that we are doing a new level now. The flow - absolute flow has started to come back as brokers and dealers recognize that it\u2019s not just a [indiscernible]. So I think there is opportunity as previously discussed for the market to pick up, pricing to pick up and margin to pick up through the end of the year. We\u2019re a cyclical business. Those un-relations will continue to be there - the rest of our lives more likely. We endeavor to try and mitigate or mute those cycles to a small degree. Again our focus is in a very broad product diversification. We see that the advantage there at Butler and in our other mills. We certainly see the Achilles\u2019 heel when you don\u2019t have that at Columbus right now. And I\u2019m confident that the team over the next 12 months will diversify that mill such that we never see such a - some of the re-inversion again going forward. So, I think, yes, we see those in un-relations. I do believe you will. But they\u2019re probably being more like those in 2012-2013 and not as precipitous is the one that we\u2019ve seen. Matthew Korn : All right. I appreciate the answer. Let me ask more particularly about the domestic market end-use demand. When you\u2019re thinking about the big buckets; construction, auto, energy manufacturing, how would you say your reads change relative to when you reported at the end last year. Is auto looking worse, is construction looking better, isn\u2019t overall maybe slight contraction for the U.S. and total demand for steel, is that a fair forecast today? Unidentified Participant : I believe that underlying demand, our picture of the underlying demand remains relatively intact with the exception of across in energy, it depends on when you say at the end of the year, but you go back to the September, October, our energy thoughts were perhaps a little different than that\u2019s of today. Automotive remains incredibly strong, manufacturing appears solid to us and we do believe construction is, continues to recover. The performance at New Millennium is just outstanding. I think it gives us a window into the recovery. Unfortunately the beam market isn\u2019t necessary seeing that same shift, as we\u2019re fighting with same issues of the sheet. Inventory overhang there, you got a pretty large amount of inflow steel that came in at the end of last year in that last couple of months and that needs to dissipate. As the weather changes, that inventory dissipates there, I think our structure business will pick up, back up. Mark Millett : So, I would say, I don\u2019t see a massive changes in underlying demand. Our major headwind as an industry, certainly I think probably only one that concerns me is the SDI - is the input pressure. Matthew Korn : Appreciated. Best of luck for the rest to you. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Michael Gambardella of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Gambardella : Good morning everyone. Mark Millett : Good morning, Michael. Michael Gambardella : Question mark on, if you could talk a little bit about the timing lags that you see in that will impact your metal spread particularly in the sheet market, your sheet market business, you had the scrap prices usually lead steel prices down and you had to reverse this time scrap held up, and now you\u2019ve seen scrap come down. Can you talk about, how you see the timing lags on both your steel price realizations and particularly on the sheet business, and the scrap cost going down. How that\u2019s going to impact with the second quarters and the third quarters going forward? Mark Millett : Well, I think the -- on the scrap raw material side, it\u2019s not much different than we\u2019ve reported previously. We carried about four weeks or five weeks typically of a - the typical production the month at steel mills. So, the -- you got two of it, one, the industry fell through, which would typically suggest that you\u2019re going to see the lower raw material level hit in sort of April, essentially May timeframe. That extends a little bit, because the production levels have been down in April. So we should see sometime in May, June, our own material cost come down. On the timing of pricing - our product pricing on the sheet side of our business, we can\u2019t lag the CRU index of the market, I would say buyback [indiscernible]. Theresa Wagler : Mike, just to be clear - the drop that you would have seen in the quarter called scrap taken in February - so for the February buy. We typically would have seen most of that in March where we\u2019re not able to see that in March. We\u2019re going to see that more in April. This timeframe we can just slow our production. And so as Mark talked about [indiscernible]. So we\u2019re still - we\u2019re going to see some of that benefit earlier in the second quarter. Michael Gambardella : How do you balance these lower scrap costs filtering-in because you have the higher variable cost versus up two thirds of your competitors domestically are more fixed price - fixed cost with iron ore or integrated producers. How do you balance your new lower cost structure with taking share and the ability to take share from two-thirds of the market domestically and putting more pressure on pricing? Mark Millett : I don\u2019t think we will - there\u2019s a need to put full pressure - look when you say pressure on pricing, I assume, downward pressure. I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any need for further downward price structure. I think we\u2019re going to see that we\u2019ve hit a bottom. See things, again you got a couple things happening like as you know, inquiries have no doubt coming down, we\u2019re seeing it as I said in the order profile that our customers have given us. You also have some blast furnaces that are out so the demand is - demand, capacity generally has ebbed little bit. So I don\u2019t see a need for downward pricing pressure, I think we\u2019ve bottomed, the spread between domestic pricing and global pricing has eroded to a point where at least if I was a customer or consumer, I\u2019ve got no idea why you would take a speculative risk, the quality risk, the claim risk, and everything else associated with an import done today. So, import levels should naturally start ebbing, and then take any pressure from. Michael Gambardella : Do you feel you are currently gaining share in the sheet market? Mark Millett : Well, we\u2019re certainly seeing a significant increase in order rate. Unidentified Participant : Yeah. I think, it needless to say, as you just mentioned blast furnace outages, as they run through their slab inventories and so forth. There\u2019s maintenance outages, we think advantageously took our maintenance outages early, and have those behind us, and are prepared to take advantage of the opportunities going forward, and that would needless to say translate into a slightly higher share, may not be sustainable in the real long-term when flat furnaces come back in the market, but our mission will be to hold on to with and play for more. Michael Gambardella : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Justine Fisher of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. JustineFisher: Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Justine Fisher : I just have one other question that\u2019s a steel price environment, sorry to kick the dead horse here, but the question to you guys is can the steel prices increase meaningfully if a dollar doesn\u2019t weaken, or is the dollar even strengthened? Mark Millett : I think is the price, well, the dollar does two things. I guess, it creates the import pressure, which puts pricing pressure to our market, and it produces the operating costs of strong competition, which gives them a greater ability to reduce cost. I think that the principal headwind as I said to both the utilization and the product pricing is the level of import. Justine Fisher : Okay. So basically, because when I think - I think if people look at where steel prices have gone, they can - you can bifurcate it into the raw materials question and the dollar question. So on the raw material side, it definitely seems as though, the consensus is that they can go much lower. But on the currency side, I mean could that continue to be a headwind to prices going meaningfully higher as a lot in the market seemed to expect in 2Q and 3Q? Mark Millett : It depends, it depends where you see the dollar go, is it going to strengthen significantly more than we see today. I think our perspective is that this is going to be a pretty stable. It certainly not going to weaken in the near-term for sure. It certainly will create that the input [indiscernible] competition to bring materially, the price of up handle and put up and today. I think it is 400ish per ton. By that time you get that to a Midwest location, probably run about at 450, 460 and lo and behold that\u2019s where the market price is today. Justine Fisher : Okay. Thanks for that. And another question I have is just on the kind of high level view of what the engagements for this scrap industry now, someone had asked if you guys were interested in acquisition in scraping and you said no, but how does it end, I mean assuming the dollar just stays even stable so the export market is not great so the U.S. scrap industry remained under pressure. I mean, does if we think about liquidations of smaller scrap, I mean does that put significant pressure on the scrap reservoir, and then prices go up? Or does it just mean that the remaining yards collect the same amount of scrap so we shouldn\u2019t expect the scrap pricing necessarily go up because of a shortage? Is it just a matter of who is collecting it of who is collecting it as opposed to how much scrap there is? I mean, should we be think about there being like a much higher scrap market in the next two years if there is a meaningful shake out in the industry or is a just a game of shuffling the cards in terms of ownership. Mark Millett : I think it\u2019s a lot of - let roughly expand and let\u2019s what it is more of the shuffling of the cards, the scrap reservoir actually is good, the prime generation is phenomenal, right now. Again because the old model seems so strong, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the kind of the inversion of the prime obsolete premium. I think as the industry goes through a shake, the impact is not necessarily on the price of scrap, the market price of scrap to the mill, it\u2019s a matter of what the scrap industry pays for its obsolete scrap. Obviously today there\u2019s fierce competition between all the players, and there\u2019s a lot of them, and that changes. So will there be competition for those units? Russell. RussellRinn: Yeah I would agree [indiscernible], I think again the amount of scrap which is generated in the U.S. not going to move down significantly, not going to change significantly, I don\u2019t think even in the long term. So I think, what you\u2019re going to have is fewer players collecting the same amount of scrap. Justine Fisher : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Lane of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Andrew Lane : Hi, there good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Andrew Lane : Really just - really just one big picture question from me. We\u2019ve always appreciated Steel Dynamics low cost position in the market, but just take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Given local cost deflation in major steel producing countries like Brazil and Russia and significantly lower seaborne raw material costs for previously high cost operators in China. Has Steel Dynamics positioning on the global cost curve changed at all over the last couple quarters? Mark Millett : Well, our cost structure given that the price of scrap coming down is obviously dropped. And I would suggest that relatively as others come down, that\u2019s where we change our relative position. But they\u2019ve come down closer to us, and we remain as effective and as efficient as anyone. I think, the recent scrap move is certainly reestablished the industry and the states to be at somewhat on a hard metal cost basis, attractive, whereas the integrated mill have a advantage there for a few months. Theresa Wagler : The other thing, I\u2019d just pass you to remember is that, we treat 85% to 90% of all our cost are actually variable in the nature, which is something that most of these are these other operations can\u2019t really approach that level which is a big benefit on the competitive side as well. Andrew Lane : Great. Thanks and congratulations on a resilient quarter. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question from Brian Yu of Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Hsien Yu : Thanks. Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Brian. Brian Hsien Yu : Hi, Mark. That the flat roll does get a lot of attention likely so, but the loan products markets and merchant bar, rebar tends to fly in the radar a bit. And if I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly, you got no margins that are actually expanding premiums versus import tend to be remaining high. Is there something fundamentally different here versus the role, in terms of, how imports can respond to one of these pricing dynamics? Mark Millett : Well, I think it tends to be more established sort of the trade roots in the relationships on the sheet side of the business. And just the physical nature of the [indiscernible] versus the structural tends to make it more meaningful to import. Structural quarter-over-quarter has seen a slow, but continue to increase in the import level for sure. I think that may have anticipated a little bit, here recently, because the industry readjusted it\u2019s pricing. What was that though\u2026 Unidentified Participant : [Indiscernible] Mark Millett : Yeah. And again that adjusted the domestic level spread again. Brian Hsien Yu : Okay. Second question is, I\u2019m not sure, if I miss this, Mesabi Nugget what\u2019s the ongoing idling cost associated with it? Mark Millett : You didn\u2019t miss it Brian, we didn\u2019t said that. Brian Hsien Yu : Okay. Is that something you can tell us...? Mark Millett : I don\u2019t mean to be positioned, but we\u2019re - after our May board meeting or review, I think we have clarity for you all to what that might be? Brian Hsien Yu : All right, maybe try a different one, the fabrication backlog and your shipments in the core, I think were up about 19% year-on-year. What is - is there anything you can gain from your backlog in terms of you have the fabrication volumes might unfold for the year. Are we - is it strong - so strong that we\u2019d be looking at that double-digit growth rates for your fab business? Mark Millett : Well, the indicators we watch, if you look at the typical order life cycle for us, Brian it\u2019s about 12 weeks, 13 weeks. So you\u2019re about at the quarter. Code activities are stiff, remained strong, so we believe that that\u2019s indicative at least through the next quarter. We see continued strength in the architectural billing index. We see bookings year-over-year as the industry still in double-digits. So, we don\u2019t have any cold water to pull on it at the moment. We only have that to go by, and right now, our customers are fairly bullish. The one thing, we don\u2019t face quite to the extent of our other product lines is the import pressures. Most of our imports that we compete with come from are limited in North America. And so, we are really sensitive to what the domestic markets doing, and how our industry is aligned to serve that market and both remained healthy at the moment. Theresa Wagler : Brian, from what we can see right now, I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s unreasonable, we\u2019ve think that double-digit growth in shipment is possible based on market expectations in our current market share. Brian Hsien Yu : Okay. Great. Thanks, it\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Philip Gibbs : Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the supply demand dynamics [indiscernible] and a long products markets, and how that might be a bit different relative to what you are seeing on the flat roll side? Or imports - have imports been as big of an issue there for you. Mark Millett : Well, needless to say with our product diversification, by mill we don\u2019t have as a large of a concentration as some of our domestic competitors doing a long products arena, but rebar remains under attack even with the successful or partially successful trade case that was a result on rebar. I will tell you that we\u2019ve tried to remove our self from the rebar market as much as possible, serving our longtime loyal customers and so forth, but just reducing the amount of exposure that we are attempting to turn on from an inventory cycles perspective. Another long products, I\u2019d tell you that we\u2019re doing extremely well, Steel of West Virginia running flat out basically a 100% utilization of their time. They\u2019ve brought on 12 new sections of [indiscernible] flats and so that\u2019s product differentiation there is no other domestic competitor. Those are used in ship building and marine applications and we\u2019re getting tremendous reception from the marine architects and fabricators and so forth. So we\u2019re excited about that, but it is a different dynamic than the flat roll, the product by product again we developed a new product in Pittsboro, a threaded rod. We\u2019re going to trial three inch threaded rod this quarter and that just stands to again be another success to us. So we have a little bit greater opportunity to push out and into other arenas in the long products. They are all demanding but we are very proud of the efforts that have been made today. Philip Gibbs : Okay. Terrific. And then a question on Columbus if I could, any update you could provide us on the synergies there and maybe some progress moving more toward utilizing the downstream assets? Unidentified Participant : Well, I just say that we continue to explore our synergies on a weekly basis, we have employees going both directions, in all the arenas, whether it would be melting, casting or hot rolling. And then finishing as you pointed out that we have a great opportunity we just put a manager and galvanizing, he comes out of the Butler operations. We deployed the existing galvanizing manager into the engineering arena. And so there has been a management shift to try to bring maybe faster acceleration of the integration and the synergy recognition between them. But I don\u2019t have a dollar, I can\u2019t dollarize it for you, but I would tell you that both teams are serious about it. Butler is gaining knowledge from the way Columbus has done things in the past. And Columbus is I think reaping the benefits and will continue to of the integration process and the realization of those synergies as we go forward here. Mark Millett : Yeah, I think to put a number on it, we\u2019re probably around $12 million $15 million by the end of the year. Theresa Wagler : The outside of any product mix shift et cetera. So more [indiscernible] we talked about. Unidentified Participant : I mean one point again, we\u2019ve introduced different ways of thinking about stuff and I think there actually their head count is down by 45 people. And again not because they\u2019re put into any distressed mode so forth. It\u2019s actually just a different methodology, we had different programs. We\u2019re still going to implement order entry systems that for that we\u2019ve developed over the years and that will help them streamline opportunities we\u2019re not - we\u2019re not done. Philip Gibbs : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Charles Bradford of Bradford Research. Please go ahead. Charles Bradford : Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Charles. Charles Bradford : Hi. As we all know U.S. Steel has announced that they\u2019re going to put in an electric furnace into Fairfield, Alabama. It\u2019d seem like that furnace isn\u2019t enough for them to continue their current mix and they may very well be going at a flat rolls deal. Are you seeing any of their customers beginning to gravitate towards you and Columbus? Because that would be sort of like the natural progression of things. Mark Millett : I don\u2019t think we have, Charles. Not yet. It\u2019s probably a little premature. But certainly if that does happen, I think it would certainly help Columbus in a great way. I think they\u2019ve got a doubling line down there, doubling lines, which will help dramatically. Unidentified Participant : But I think needless to say they have options, they\u2019ve have other facilities in which they supply slabs. And so it would be I think a little bit premature for us to determine what U.S. Steel\u2019s thinking is going to be as far as total asset utilizations. Charles Bradford : I think that customers are beginning to think about supply? Mark Millett : Sure. They\u2019re thinking it. Needless to say we\u2019re thinking about the customer from the scrap side and so it\u2019s cuts both way there. Unidentified Participant : Thank you very much. Unidentified Participant : Thank you, Chuck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Nathan Littlewood of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Nathan Littlewood : Thanks guys. And I appreciate all your time here this morning, being so generous with it. I just had a couple of questions on trade cases. I guess if we distill the situation down, there is fundamentally two parts. One is the demonstration or proving if you will of material injury then there is the existence or otherwise of anti-dumping or dumping and the countervailing duties or subsidies. So I guess if we think about it in the context of those two parts, are you able to kind of or tell us whether in your opinion you believe that the material injury had all has already been met. And if so, does the absence of the trade case today imply that given things like currency and fuel prices and freight rights, somewhat not, it is actually pretty hard to prove there is dumping actually taking place at the moment? Mark Millett : Well, I think, I can tell you that again each of us in the steel industry look at who we believe the targets of our - of our cases should be, we divide up those and work on them independently. Everyone who is participating in a possible trade case will bear a share of responsibilities to go into the home markets of those countries, determine what the market, home market prices are for the products in question. And we also then do research on subsidy potential because as you pointed out that the account bearing duties are really to address the subsidy issue and antidumping of course is the unfair trade practices of selling in our market at a number as lower than our market or other markets that they serve. And so, I can tell you that there is some tremendously large percentage of damages, potential damages that we believe are being exploited improperly, illegally and those would be the subject of any case. But even a question earlier about the strengthening dollar, and whether that would influence from a pricing, as the dollar is moving in single digit percentages, I\u2019m talking double digit and triple digit damage being done here, in some cases or in some products, and so, it could be, we\u2019re not worried about the changing dollar to really affect the trade case issues. Nathan Littlewood : Okay. But I guess that\u2019s certainly useful background, but is it stand today, do you feel like you\u2019ve proven the material injury, and that hurdle has been passed. And that therefore we\u2019re at the point now, where it sort of made about whether or not there is a reason kind of [indiscernible] and dumping going on? Mark Millett : Well, again I cannot speak for - I only deal with my trade council, and I can\u2019t talk about as I don\u2019t know about any of our competitors, and their material injury, needless to say their products where as an industry we\u2019re under attack and yet SDI still makes a profit. So, therefore we had to wait until all the trade councils communicate on those issues, and then that of course would affect the timing. Nathan Littlewood : Okay, got it. Okay, thanks very much guys. I appreciate the information there. Mark Millett : You\u2019re welcome. Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Nathan. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Curt Woodworth of Nomura. Please go ahead. Curt Woodworth : Hi, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Curt Woodworth : Just want to get back to the metal spread question, Mark. Obviously since the last mid-quarter update you\u2019ve seen fair amount of incremental pressure there with flat roll down about $30 to $35 a ton in scrap. Seems to be that bouncing somewhat in the U.S., so lot more in Europe. So, I just want to get your take on, on how that should flow through to you guys given, it seems like you are talking about four to five week lag mechanisms, because thus far metal [indiscernible] pretty resilient for you guys, I mean you are only down slightly year-on-year and about $16 this quarter relative to your average yet. If I look at total numbers for this year on a spot basis, spreads were about 190 versus last year they seemed to be averaging about 270, so is there - is there some offset on a long side, or is this a lag - a lag this year that we need to think about? Mark Millett : I\u2019ll let you conclude at that, but I would suggest, and I\u2019ve not looked in detail, not just recently quantifying the difference between this year, last year, and any other year. But sequentially, again as we suggested earlier, the - on the upside of business we should see the benefit of scrap that was sold in the second quarter flowing in. As Chris alluded to and I alluded to, yeah, she thinks that it will little soon and I with six weeks to eight weeks after February. We put the full benefit there, obviously the market pricing on the sheet is under pressure at the second, but as that inventory dissipates we truly believe, we\u2019ll see an uptick in pricing because of the that the I don\u2019t say priority, but the erosion of domestic level pricing. So, generally we should see margin expansion in to some degree not massively in the second quarter, something we\u2019ll see it through the second half of the year. Curt Woodworth : Got it, okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aldo Mazzaferro of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Aldo Mazzaferro : Hi, good morning, Mark. Mark Millett : Good morning, Aldo. Aldo Mazzaferro : I wanted to congratulate on the earnings you\u2019ve reported and the balance sheet improvement and the free cash flow and dividend in - such a tough quarter. I\u2019m wondering, do you see further scope for the reduction of working capital going forward or do we think we saw most of it in the first quarter? Theresa Wagler : Aldo, I think do we still have an opportunity for some working capital reduction - that working capital reduction that you witness in the first quarter was largely related to value versus there are still opportunity on the volume side. So I still think there is some opportunity for some working capital funding into the second quarter. Aldo Mazzaferro : Great. My next question is on the scrap business. I was amazed that how you minimize the damage from this volume and pricing. And I\u2019m just wondering Russ, maybe can you tell us how you did it? Was it early in the quarter, you just clampdown on the scale pricing, and sold your inventory early. I don\u2019t know, I just wondered, if you could just explain a little bit how you managed to come out with such a minimal loss on it, such a bad quarter for scrap? Mark Millett : It\u2019s just a magic, Aldo. It\u2019s just a magic. No, it\u2019s just again, it\u2019s good and top team, and the depth and the talent of our scrap team. They - again manage their business very well, they did a good job of controlling their inflows and maximizing their outflows, and it\u2019s just as simple as that. Again knowing that that we saw that\u2019s coming, and since that coming that we managed our business quarterly and again it contributes to the team. Aldo Mazzaferro : So we saw - if you saw prices flat from here for the second quarter, do you think you\u2019ve any change in your metal spread or roughly stable? Mark Millett : Well, it\u2019s - if we say - if we see top prices flat from here to the quarter. Aldo Mazzaferro : Yeah. Mark Millett : I would say, it\u2019s still bad luck there, although there is still awful lot of competition out there as we talk about earlier. So, again we\u2019ve got a still lot of orders, so we\u2019ve got - we\u2019ve got to participate at whatever level. So, ideally when the script selling price goes down, the buying price ought to go down in accordance or more, that\u2019s always what we try to do, whether we\u2019re successful at it, I guess we\u2019ll have to wait to see in June or in July. Aldo Mazzaferro : Thanks. And then I just finally kind of a similar question on the steel side. I think the pricing ended the quarter at the low point, when I gathered. So, going forward, if we stay at flat pricing, we\u2019re probably going to see lower average pricing in the second quarter, and yet you are picking up some benefits in a FIFO basis from the step class, declining. Theresa, when you say your metal spreads in second quarter would be improvement from here assuming flat pricing? I mean assuming flat pricing from the end of the quarter? Mark Millett : Yeah. I think we stated out of that -- too soon to know, but we\u2019re going to get the scrap benefit. Order backlogs are not substantial. So you don\u2019t know really where the May, June pricing will end-up. What we do feel that there\u2019ll be a slight margin expansion are. Aldo Mazzaferro : Great. Well, thanks Mark. Congratulations. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you the next question is from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Philip Gibbs : Just a quick follow-up here. You said your utilization in Q1 I think was around 73%. Any range that you can provide us for the second quarter? Mark Millett : Again Phil, without transparency into May and June it would be hypothetical at this moment in time. I would say though that it\u2019s up, again Butler and the - and Columbus in particular have had strong bookings and there is no reason to think that as inventory dissipates, that should change. Philip Gibbs : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, everyone. I don\u2019t know if anyone still on the call after we beat that dead horse and then in times on spread, and market. But I just would like to emphasize the differentiation of our team, and our company, and our business model. I think we\u2019re continued to be well positioned, a low-high variable cost structure, the low fixed costs coupled with the highly diversified product mix, will continue to generate a very, very strong cash flow through the cycle. And as things, pickup, it should pick up also. We certainly clearly differentiated ourselves, I think consistently outperformed our peer group. And we got a passionate team and have a wonderful customer base to support that. Our organic initiatives, engineered bar and rail are proving to - continue to prove our abilities there. New Millennium Building Systems, I mean continues to shine and so I think we\u2019re well positioned to going forward, so I appreciate your continued support of our company. And to our customers, thank you for your support also. To our employees, sincere thanks; your passion for excellence, hard work and dedication is backbone of our company and just as we all say each and every day, each and every minute we say, thank you all. Operator : Once again ladies and gentleman that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you Marlene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. The first half of 2015 continue to be an interesting start of the year. Significant industry shifts taking place for the fundamental through the domestic steel community and raw material and product pricing as well as recent preliminary and trade case advancement. But before exploring our thoughts regarding the domestic steel landscape and how Steel Dynamics is uniquely positioned for growth I have Theresa to comment on the second quarter financial results. Theresa? Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Our second quarter 2015 adjusted net income was $53 million or $0.22 per diluted share which was within our adjusted guidance of between $0.20 and $0.24. The adjustment excludes two items, the first approximately $29 million or $0.07 per diluted share of expenses associated with idling our Minnesota iron operations and of that excluded amount, approximately $21 million represents non-cash inventory evaluation adjustments. The second item represents approximately $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share of reduced earnings related to the planned furnace maintenance outage at iron dynamics. The last time a significant maintenance was required was in 2008 over seven years. Including the adjustment, second quarter 2015 reported GAAP net income was $32 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Regarding Minnesota, the operations are in their expected idle state with the corresponding reduction in our employee base completed. We expect the ongoing financial impact from the operations to Steel Dynamics financial results to be minimal at less than $1 million a month from both an earnings and EBITDA perspective and as such we don\u2019t expect specifically identified and separately in the near future. Second quarter 2015 consolidated revenues were $2 billion, 2% lower than the sequential quarter based on average product pricing reduction, not volume as both steel and metals recycling shipments increased sequentially. Adjusted operating income was $120 million compared to first quarter results of $100 million a 20% improvement based on record fabrication performance and significantly improved Metals Recycling results. For the second quarter 2015 steel shipments increased 15% to over $2.2 million tons compared to the first quarter. However, profitability remained relatively flat as metal spread contraction offset the improved volume. As steel imports remain high, steel prices were pressured and our average second quarter sales price declined at $101 per ton while our average scrap cost declined only $57 per ton. For our recycling platform, ferrous shipments increased 10% in the second quarter stemming from domestic steel metal utilization improvement. First metal scrap stand at 9% as scrap cost volatility subsided. From a non-ferrous perspective, shipments also increased 6%; however, metal spread fleet fairly flat. As a result our metal recycling operations second quarter operating income increased meaningfully over the sequential quarter to $12.2 million. A continuing terrific story for our fabrication operations. The positive momentum in underlying non-residential construction demand combined with our national presence and stellar customer service, result in record performance metrics for the quarter and for the year so far. Second quarter 2015 record operating income from our fabrication platform was $20 million or 27% higher than our previous record. Record operating income per ton was $252, over 30% higher than first quarter performance. We continue to see improvements in underlying non-residential construction demand, which is good news for all of our business as the construction factor is also the largest domestic steel consumer. During the second quarter, we generated significant cash flow from operations of $309 million with operational working capital providing $193 million. The working capital reduction was a result of more normalized scrap volume at our steel mills as second quarter production utilization improved and also due to reduced overall scrap values. Second quarter capital investments totaled $23 million. We estimate annual, excuse me, we estimate annual 2015 capital expenditures be in the range of $150 million. This includes some payments for the recently announced $100 million paint line expansion at Columbus. However, most of the cost for that project will be incurred in 2016. We maintain our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders, which increased by 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Our history of increased quarterly dividend continues to demonstrate evidence of the confidence our Board of Directors have and the strength of our cash generation capability, financial position and optimism concerning our future. As demonstrated during the first half of 2015, throughout market cycles, our business model generates strong cash flow, based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations. Even after deleveraging our balance sheet and increasing cash dividend, we have record liquidity of more than $1.6 billion at June 30, 2015. Total debt remained consistent at $2.7 billion while net debt of $2.2 billion decreased another $258 million in the quarter or 10% due to free cash flow performance. I would like to point out that the adjusted EBITDA in the press release schedule denotes the number we use for financial covenant purposes. However, if we would have fully adjust for the Minnesota and Iron Dynamics items that occurred in the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $197 million and pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA is $973 million. This gets us to a net leverage of 2.4 times. Our credit profile remains in line with our preferred through-cycle net leverage of less than three times, which is a testament to our disciplined approach to growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook is incredibly flexible. We don\u2019t have any near term meaningful maturities and those in the long term are well laddered and in the interim years have call provision flexibility. Looking forward, we believe that our capital structure and credit profile have the flexibility to not only sustain current operations, but to support additional strategic growth investment. Mark? Mark Millett : Thanks Theresa. I think it's never redundant to state that there's nothing more important to us than creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Safety is the forefront and integral to everything we do. Though our safety performance is better than our industry average, our goal remains at zero safety incident work environment and the team did a great job in that respect in the second quarter. They reduced companywide recordable entries by over 25%. We continue implementing new initiatives and reinforcing others to drive toward our ultimate goal of no injuries and no incidents. Operationally, the team has performed well in a continued challenging environment. The ongoing flood of steel imports continue to pressure steel product pricing to a greater degree than the benefit from lower scrap cost. As a result the steel dynamics along with the industry in general experienced margin compression in the second quarter. Our average selling price fell $101 per ton, while our average scrap cost per ton only decreased by $57. However, due to continued solid domestic demand, our steel shipments improved 15% offsetting the margin compression in the quarter. After operating at a trough utilization rate in March, our steel operations have been achieving monthly sequential volume improvements. Driven by stronger flat row production, our second quarter steel utilization rate recovered significantly to 87%. It was meaningfully higher than our first quarter performance as well as the average domestic mill utilization. While our company-wide exposure to the energy sector approximates only 8% it is higher at our recent acquired Columbus flat row steel mill, which was particularly impacted by both imports and reduced energy sector steel consumption. As you may recall, our first order of business after buying Columbus was to significantly expand market and product diversification moving toward a greater number of customer relationships and a broader mix of value added products serving more industries. The teams are making tremendous progress in automotives and construction related products. They are also making good progress in potential Mexican export opportunities. Market shifts take time, but our planned paint line and Galvalume addition on the Columbus campus will be a significant catalyst. The $100 million investment will provide roughly 250,000 tons of annual coding capability and further diversification into higher margin products with Columbus. We already have two paint lines and Galvalume capability in Indiana, but this project allows for higher product quality, double-wide steel and access to seller markets including Mexico. We plan to sell service-critical appliance-grade steel as well as construction related products. Operations are expected to begin during the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, we continue to improve Columbus' operating costs and product breadth and quality capabilities. Columbus saw 34% more value added galvanized steel in the second quarter and achieved record production results on those lines. We continue to see the benefit of collaboration between our Columbus and Butler Flat Roll teams. Along with production and process successes, since the acquisition, Columbus is implementing great cost reduction initiatives with many more in the works. Additionally, our steel platform continues to benefit from more significant organic growth investments. The additional of premium rail capability and expanded engineer special bar quality capacity. In rail, all domestic class one railroads have qualified premium head-hardened rail. Year-to-date, rail shipments have increased over 45% from last year and premium rail has been the driver. Railroad investment forecast suggest domestic rail consumption will continue to be strong during the next three to five years despite the energy decline. We're committed to the rail market and are targeting shipments of up to 350,000 tons per year. The capability to well 320 foot length rail versus the conventional 80 foot strips is a strong competitive advantage, improving rail safety and reducing our customer's maintenance cost and installation time. Regarding SBQ, the product and capacity expansion within our engineered special bar quality operations also continues to ramp up. With the energy market weakness for the larger diameter SBQ market has not been as strong in 2015 and our addition of the smaller diameter bars has provided product diversification and aided mill utilization. Metals recycling as we suggested less volatility in scrap prices and higher domestic steel mill utilization, the profitability from our metals recycling operations meaningfully improved in the second quarter. Compared to a slight loss in the first quarter, we recorded a $12 million operating profit in the second based on increased storage shipments and metal spread. Additionally, the symbiotic relationship between our recycling operations and steel mills facilitates lower average input costs as compared to our peers. The recycling environment remains challenging and there appears to be a shift in the supply and demand balance. The continued significant overcapacity of shredders, particularly in the Southeast and U.S. continues to constrain margin as processes are competing for the same material. However scrap export levels have fallen in the past two consecutive years, with volumes significantly lower than recent historical norms. The expectation of the continued strong U.S. dollar reducing scrap exports and the resulting ample scrap supply, we don\u2019t see any unlikely drivers for significant increases in ferrous scrap prices in the near term. Based on this difficult operating environment, we believe there will be consolidation or rationalization of smaller scrap companies in the near future. As communicated in our May 26 press release, we elected to idle our Minnesota iron making operations for an initial 24-month period given the significant and sustained decline in iron pricing. In this market condition, the cost to produce iron nuggets is meaningfully higher than product selling values. Again the strength of U.S. dollar and raw iron ore supply and demand factors support the thesis to sustain lower pig iron prices. Since our investment in iron making capacity was indented to the hedge against high price pig iron is scraped, the indefinite idle was a prudent and necessary response to the prevailing market environment. While the lower raw material cost environment advantages our steel platform, it has resulted in our own economic situation in Minnesota. Let me say, I want to sincerely thank the whole Minnesota team for their commitment and persistence in pioneering and succeeding in bringing a new pig iron production technology to life. Unfortunately, in the end it was not a matter of technology and/or management because the process works and is purely the result of the market economics. I commend the dedication, hard work and strong commitment of the employees and the area of communities and I\u2019m pleased to report that we were able to offer positions to approximately 90% of those employees who wish to have employment within the SCI family out of the locations. The fabrication platform continues to achieve record operational and financial performance. Second quarter operating results was $28 million surpass the previous record by 27%, which was achieved in the fourth quarter of last year. The fabrication group achieved record operating income at four of our six plants. The team did a phenomenal job. Going to the field joist institute, year-over-year domestic joist shipments increased about 2% year-to-date. We\u2019ve gained market share as our shipments increased 11% over the timeframe. The team continues to perform exceedingly well both in market share advancement and leveraging our national footprint. It's a credit to the foresight and positioning what the team did over the past several years. Based on sustainable increased demand and market share gain, we've added production shifts to several of our plants creating more jobs in our local communities. The strength of this business provides insight into the continued growth of non-residential construction activity. Overall, while external challenges create a turbulent environment for us, all our employees performed well in the second quarter, driving operational and financial metrics that are gained with the top of our peer group. Now to the macro environment, we believe the U.S. has solid demand dynamics in place. Consumer confidence is expanding, remains intact. Durable goods and construction investment continue to grow, both key measures of U.S. steel consumption. Forecast for the two largest domestic steel consuming sectors, automotive and construction, remain good. Automotive is forecasted to grow to almost 80 million units over the next few years and overall construction spending and domestic manufacturing continues to trend favorably. However, excess steel import volume combined with higher than typical inventory levels has limited U.S. steel mill productivity, but we believe the tide is turning. Inventory levels should continue to decline in the coming months. Underlying market demand should give further support to steel product pricing, which we believe has stabilized. On the raw materials side, scrap flow remains good and the strength of the U.S. dollar should continue to impede scrap export market. Consequently, there doesn\u2019t appear to be strong drivers for ferrous scrap price appreciation. We expect raw material pricing to remain relatively stable at current levels and perhaps trend lower for low iron ore pricing environment persists. We believe the fundamentals are supportive of stronger economic growth in the U.S. during the second half of the year. However, the current uninterested global growth expectation, combined with severe worldwide steel production overcapacity will continue to be an industry headwind to steel pricing. But we believe domestic pricing overcorrected based on the recent spread to foreign prices and we think there is room for price appreciation later this year. As raw material prices remain at lower levels and utilization improves, there is margin expansion opportunity in the second half. Additionally, in order to insulate ourselves from imports, part of our strategy is not to only develop strong customer relationship, but to also manufacture products that are more difficult to compete with on a global basis, such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SVQ steel and longer length rail. As such we were able to mitigate some of the import impact and with our broad portfolio of value added products, maintain high steel metal utilization rates when compared to our peer group. On the trade front, we believe the ITC has confirmed that the flood of unfairly traded imports of corrosion-resistant sheet steel has materially reduced our shipments, pricing and profitability. I believe in fair trade that the U.S. has a dumping grand for world excess steel capacity. We are confident that such actions will create a more positive pricing environment for us going into the second half. So driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we are focusing on opportunities to maximize our financial performance. We believe our superior operating and financial performance clearly demonstrates the sustainability of our business model throughout the market cycle. We\u2019re focused on providing exceptional value to our customers, committing to the highest levels of quality and timeliness, partnering with them to create value and do what they need today and anticipating what they will need tomorrow. As we look ahead, we continue to be optimistic regarding our future. Columbus is one aspect of the story and our organic growth project is another. Strong cash flow generation through the cycle will give us solid foundation from which we can take advantage of the near opportunities that lay ahead. With strong character and determination of our employees are absolutely unmatched. The dedication to customers and passion for excellence compel us all to higher standards of performance. I thank each and every one of them and remind them safety is always the top priority each and every day, each and every hour. So again, everyone thank you for your time today and Brenda we'll open up the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Luke Folta with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your questions. Luke Folta : Hi, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Luke. Luke Folta : Great quarter. Mark Millett : Thank you. Luke Folta : Tough environment. Good execution. Well done. Mark Millett : We got a good team mate. Luke Folta : First question on SBQ, can you just give us some sense of what the order book looks like? Is the second quarter you think representative of what trough should look like near term, and any color in terms of just the end market dynamics there, I'm sure energy's weak. Any color on the other markets and how much you are shipping from the small diameter mill would be very helpful. Thanks. Mark Millett : Luke, on the actual volumes on the SBQ side, Dick probable could give a little clearer picture, but I think all our markets the SVQ arena is a little more lengthy and a little flat, I would tell you. Things that have maybe picked up just ahead the last couple of weeks, but I think mainly the customer base is just patching holes at the present time. Dick, any thoughts on the -- versus\u2026 Dick Teets : We really haven\u2019t been the stated numbers and so forth and we are still in the start-up and is a very small market. We do report into our -- through the SMA and SVQ family, but we don\u2019t report individual. But we are improving. We've gotten our precision mill working and delivering a great product out there and as you pointed out in your original statement thank goodness for the expansion in that because of the bigger bars have been the weakest of the products there. So it\u2019s really come to play quite well. Mark Millett : I think it\u2019s -- emblematic or testament to the strategy because we've had since the very beginning to diversify our product mix across many products and market sectors as we possibly can and I think seeing the benefit of that right now and obviously when the market returns there is going to be leverage that to greater profitability. But Luke I think you also mentioned that the general market and I think the markets remain somewhat mixed, but in aggregate, incremental demand growth remains intact. As we stated automotive continues to dominate. Truck trailing and material handling are actually having a peak year. Energy is almost stagnant, but we see manufacturing is solid. Residential is recovered and non-residential construction continues to rebound. I think its testament to our new millennium billing systems platform, which had a record second quarter. Their quarter activity continues to be very strong. Backlogs are suggesting another very strong year for us and so in general as the construction markets come back, I think we have considerable leverage to that because we've got about 1.5 million tons of latent unused volume that is highly correlated to that non-residential construction. I think customers are affirming sort of active demand, but right now are still reluctant to take inventory positions until I see more market transparency. They just don't want to take it in good position. As I think you just saw inventory destocking is slow, we sold I think it was the fifth month in a row of slight destocking. They were around about 2.6 months on hand today. Higher sure than last year, but slowly, slowly trending there and that destocking, I think is obviously positive for us. Dick Teets : One other observation Mark is that some of our forging customers have basically given us a double size order, but they haven\u2019t given us multiple month worth of order. So we're still trying to interpret that but we do believe that there is some strengthening, but they still have a reluctance to take along view of yet. Luke Folta : I guess on a similar note, the bounceback in shipments from the Columbus mill was pretty robust, and I know that energy tubulars is a pretty decent sized end market for them. You talked about some initiatives to expand the product offering at that facility. It seems a little early to be having that big of an impact from some of those initiatives, so if you can talk about what drove the big bounceback in Columbus shipments sequentially. Dick Teets : Well, I don\u2019t know that it was really the tonnage that was a big bounce back. We're very proud of the percentage of bounce back of the value-added I think is what Mark said because we've had the -- we're focused on additional customers, additional products, value added in particular. Theresa Wagler : To your point, they did have over 100,000 ton increase in shipment and that was again just to the marketing pushback that Dick is talking about. So it was quite a bit on volume side as well. Mark Millett : Yeah I think, we continue to say for a long time now that demand truly has incrementally grown and that underlying demand was there, which is that we had a slow imports coming in kind of the February, January, February, March timeframe and that just suffocated the market for Columbus in particular because they\u2019re obviously exposed to the Huston import arena. I think we\u2019re incredibly excited though the Columbus team is doing incredibly well. I think the collaboration between Butler and Columbus teams is incredible and it really is growing fruit. As Dick said our value-added shipments have grown quite significantly and we made great strides in quality there and are regaining a lot of the customers that another ones had. We\u2019re also leveraging our existing customer base. We have some promise that we had great working relationship over the years and their volumes have picked up dramatically and New Millennium building products also has been sourcing more steel from the Columbus. Luke Folta : Great color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead with your questions. Brian Yu : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on a good quarter especially on the free cash flow side. First one is just you guys have impressive shipments in the second quarter Mark and you said you\u2019re expecting improved financial results from the back half of the year. Does that -- embedded in there is that you will maintain these strong shipments in the back half and then I think you mentioned earlier that you think price will probably recover and those are the two combination of factors continued high volumes and some improvement in the underlying markets going to drive better results? Mark Millett : Yeah there\u2019s nothing that we see that should change the volume profile and in fact I would consider that volume profile appreciating and I think just generally with good volume, I think in turn was with margin expansion it's a positive. I think imports even though imports June, July are incredibly simple I would say, domestic pricing through the first quarter and into May declined dramatically and kind of eroded the spread and when we saw a slight decline in the import number. That is the increase. Unfortunately China\u2019s profits price dramatically and dropped by about 18% in May and the import number today is probably $390, but I think because the global spread has mitigated somewhat, I think that the trade case success will certainly bring things to a greater -- a more level playing field and the continued inventory destocking and alignment is going to help the supply demand balance to our favor. Automotive will be strong, construction is growing, manufacturing is good. You never know. Maybe the politicians will come through finally and do some infrastructure build, which will be very, very positive too. So I think there\u2019s a climate for short, stabilized, slightly appreciating pricing and at the same time raw material costs scrapped in particular I think is selling on a trend more unlikely than you got a iron ore supply all today I think is round about $50ish and will remain low and that\u2019s going to draw scrap down. Strong dollar is going to continue to impede exports. The billet pricing, global billet pricing is very, very low and therefore that will help that also. You got solid scrap flows, absolute flow has come back pretty well, a prompt flow due to the strong automotive production is incredible I would suggest and nuclear is that going to market with inline supplying some other mills. So I think we\u2019ve got an environment whereby raw material pricing is at minimum high most likely banned and you have some appreciation drivers for pricing. So I think from a second math perspective, we\u2019re still optimistic. Brian Yu : Okay. Great. And second question is just on working capital, there\u2019s been a significant improvement year-to-date, if we look at some of the relative metrics like days outstanding or churn rate are these at your targets or is there further room for improvement? Theresa Wagler : What you\u2019re seeing in the quarter Brian is again a realignment on the scrap volume at the steel mills based on the improved utilization in the second quarter and a decreased scrap value. But going forward, there is still room for improvement. One example is that we still don\u2019t necessarily have the finished goods volumes at Columbus where we\u2019d like to see those. So there is different areas where we still think we can lift some additional cash from working capital but we feel pretty good about where we are. I wouldn't expect huge strings in the second half. Brian Yu : Okay, would you say at today's prices, would you be able to quantify and how much more working capital you could extract from Columbus? Theresa Wagler : I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable. I think it\u2019s not unreasonable to say probably in the $50 million range. Brian Yu : Okay. Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions. Matthew Korn : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my call. Mark Millett : You\u2019re welcome. Matthew Korn : So Mark as you pointed out, raw materials are low, steel shipments for the overall industry steel seem weighted down by the energy markets who got domestic capacities still in the lower mid-70s, couple months back there was a smattering these price hike announcements, but the index has really only moved gradually. Do you think we can get above $500 and for hot rolled in this environment and how much do you think we need to be worried that the China Midwest spread is starting to blow out a little bit again as the prices in Asia crumble? Mark Millett : I think the domestic pricing kind of over corrected to some degree and I was pretty back in April, May pretty confident that you could see some metal price increase. With them coming down even further, that\u2019s almost going to be a headwind and put pressure on pricing. But the -- you can see a $500 or $480 number domestically. I think that is more than reasonable particularly when you have the potential trade case kicking in next month or two well June second quarter it\u2019s going to have more and more of an affect. Matthew Korn : Second half. Mark Millett : Yep. Matthew Korn : Okay. All right. Then let me ask this a little bit specifically I remember the last time we all spoke, how you took the lead time that expanded Butler and Columbus, but from I think it was terrific levels, orders moving up the best rates since the fall. Where are we now comparably? It would be helpful maybe you can do a rundown of the major product groups, give a little bit visibility on where lead times have shifted from last quarter? Mark Millett : I\u2019m not so sure we\u2019re going to go through each mill, but the principle players obviously are Butler and Columbus and they are in a three to four week run, and the balance that's where we typically hold that backlog through the cycle in good times or bad times to be honest. So we\u2019re quite happy obviously with little more price, but nonetheless backlog and lead time there is on target. Matthew Korn : All right. Thanks very much. Congratulations again on the quarter. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Evan Kurtz : Hey good morning, everyone. Mark Millett : Hey Evan. Evan Kurtz : I thought some of your commentary on end market demand was pretty encouraging and certainly congruent with everything we\u2019re seeing on construction data as far as permits and non-res spending and auto sales and so forth. So kind of one question that I have in my mind is if you look at the service center data for the past couple of months, their shipments are actually been down year-on-year. So it\u2019s kind of inconsistent with kind of what we\u2019re seeing from the bottom up and I was just curious to get your thoughts on for one, what\u2019s driving that and then also what these drivers speed and how long would that take and any thoughts there would be appreciated? Mark Millett : Well, I\u2019m not sure, but a clarity than anyone else, but I do believe you\u2019ve got a -- you still have a sort of imports still on the dark side and that is kind of slowing or is a resistance to the destocking. We certainly just from the order profile that with people patching holes, they're certainly not taking positions yet and just also the possible sentiment in our discussions but it just slow drill down but it will continue. Evan Kurtz : Okay. Dick Teets : No, yeah very strong comments some of our larger service center accounts and they don\u2019t have any concerns about the year so can\u2019t give any color on it. Mark Millett : I think the other thing that the service center industry in general is essentially taken advantage of the situation, I don\u2019t blame them, but times have been short, but they're increasing. And also on the structural side, rolling schedules, I do believe have been shortened hours and that allows that sector to be well closer to the jet so to speak on inventory and on ordering. So they're ordering almost on a just in time type basis. Russ Rinn : And in chemical products, our long products its mill direct shipments and don't even go to the service centers many cases. Evan Kurtz : Okay. Thanks. The other question I had was on some of the trade legislation that\u2019s gone through and maybe you guys are close to this than some of your peers. But what do you think this all means as far as leveling the playing field, new ways to define material injury and it sounds like in conference right now and the customs build, there could be some enforcement measures that are added to the market, how do you see that from a timing perspective actually impacting pricing the U.S. and any thoughts on magnitude? Mark Millett : I would tell you that I don't see it right now. From a pricing perspective, I think it\u2019s a little bit longer term. I think it has a real meaningful impact to us because it gives commerce department greater clarity and gives us a greater opportunity to be more expeditious in our trade case filings and so forth coming up. So I think there is a lot of benefit to our industry and other industries and like situations, but right now from a direct impact on crude products or in upcoming cold rolled or hot rolled load cases, ultimately it may influence that final determination which would be in 2016 and so forth. but not in our short term quarter to quarter results that there will be nothing there for us right now. Evan Kurtz : Okay. All right great guys. Good luck on the quarter. Thanks. Mark Millett : Cheers. Operator : Our next questions comes the line of the Matt Murphy with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. Matt Murphy : All right. I have a question just on the longer term margin picture at Columbus with these investments. Is this -- you talked about when you bought Columbus, trying to eventually get to a sustained butler type of profitability, do you think these investments put you on track for that or is there more to be done beyond this? Theresa Wagler : The addition in the paint line. Mark Millett : You mentioned 15, I don\u2019t know where the 15 came from, but I would say we\u2019re absolutely confident that the earning profile of the Columbus mill has every bit more surpass equal or surpass the butler mill with the changes that we\u2019re doing. Again as I said earlier, the cap collaboration of the butler and the Columbus teams brining actually benefits to build both locations, but certainly has brought great quality, great thought diversification of capabilities there. The synergies, the near-term synergies that we advertised through 2015 are intact and the week before last, the team is incredibly focused and passionate and have a lot of opportunity to further decrease the cost structure. Obviously as we withstand the value add quoted output that's going to bring our margins up appreciably and got to believe and painted the expansion that we announced is going to be a major catalyst I think to greater earnings there and to greater diversification in great times and also improved profitability in the troughs. Matt Murphy : Great. Okay. And then I guess longer term on fabrication profitability, in the short term it sounds like the outlook is good, which is great, but medium to longer term, I am just wondering has anything changed from, if you look at 2006 through 2013 it was basically a breakeven segment. So we are in this great market for demand right now, but has anything changed you think in the long-term from an operating income perspective and your ability to sustainably report this type of operating profit? Mark Millett : Well, I think there is certainly in recent years been a market shift. Obviously if you go back a number of years, there was pretty fragmented market. Today there are essentially three players, Nucor has ramped up is got lion\u2019s share of the market was second and then Canam is another principal players, but there are couple of other little organizations out there. So I think the industry has changed. It's allowed stronger spreads, stronger margin on a per ton basis. The team I think has done a phenomenal job in recent years positioning New Millennium for this expected growth. We have a national footprint and we're leveraging that incredibly well across the country. As I think the earnings profile long-term is high highs and high lows for that business. Theresa Wagler : Matt, we're structurally different. If you look back to 2006, in 2006 we only had a couple of facilities in Indiana and in Florida and we had just added a couple of foreign acquisitions. Today we have six facilities that are throughout the United States. So structurally we have the ability to earn more as Mark said on a more sustainable basis. So I am suggesting not compare back to 2006 and 2007 timeframe. Matt Murphy : Sure. That's fair. And I guess if I look at 2013 and 2014 you had a pretty strong bump up in volumes in Q3, I am just wondering on the short term basis you talked about adding a shift. Should we -- is there a possibility we see kind of that Q2 to Q3 type of volume bump that we've seen in recent years? Theresa Wagler : Given that we're looking at construction is somewhat being obviously the strongest timeframe and given that we've been ramping up the facilities over the last several years, I think that volume and appreciation is something that would be reasonable. Matt Murphy : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. That's helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning, guys. Theresa Wagler : Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Timna. Timna Tanners : So I don\u2019t want to beat the dead horse here, but I think that one of the things that I hear from a lot of people is that concern that it will be difficult to see steel prices rise much with scrap prices weak. What do you -- how do you comment on that? I know you said there is certain conditions with the trade case and with the scrap market being over-supplied, but is it really possible to get much margin expansion in a depressed over supplied steel market as well? Mark Millett : I think Timna we kind of answered that, applicable probably is no greater than most, but in case of supply and demand, the supply side we think in Americas for the second half is going to target imports will mitigate a little. Entry is certainly coming down and the trade cases should put us on a more level playing field from a pricing standpoint. So I think those three in concert will certainly give or drive us for price appreciation. Timna Tanners : Okay. And you did, sorry I just was clarifying because this is something we hear a lot about? Mark Millett : So that being said imports is the headwind and I think if you look at SBI, we're incredibly well positioned across the whole steel space. We have organic growth. We have latent volume that we can capitalize on as the construction markets come back. So even in status quo, I think we're going to continue to take more. Dick Teets : I think just a clarification on coated products the prior countries, there are seven countries that supply more than 3% of the imports, that's the criteria, the benchmark for filing trade cases, two of them being in Canada and Mexico. And so they were two, the other five made up 67% of all imports and so when kind of availing duties are applied and dumping, it's hard to imagine how quickly that void will be created because no one is going to want to be caught having to owe those duties. So as soon as the preliminary duties are announced, it's going to become an interesting -- we already have traders looking for substitutes, but those that magically appear. It's a process. Timna Tanners : Yes that's great. So we address the margins, but talking about volumes a little bit, historically it had been the case that steel makers have more profitable in the first half than the second half, but that's kind of broken down recently and I am just wondering on fabrication, do you think fabrication long products with this end of destocking. Talk us a little bit more about what kind of volume recovery or why we could see a nice strong recovery second half from what's normally a typically seasonally strong first half? Mark Millett : I think if you look at the steel consuming economy and everyone at least when you got blinkers on in all business, its more just because profitability isn\u2019t where we would like to see it. But from the standpoint of the American economy it's strong. If you look at the steel consuming economy, it's strong, but we're consuming around about 120, 125 million tons on pace right now. The demand is there. I saw the three headwinds is the import issue. The premises would be to increase utilization in increased volume domestically would have to be that the imports mitigate to some degree. You've got a continued slight increase in demand with a erosion of imports and that would give you greater utilization in America. Timna Tanners : I was talking more about fabrication on long products. I hear what you're saying for flat rolls, if you could just add a little more because long products I was kind of surprised the second quarter decline year-over-year and structural and declining first quarter to second quarter, seasonally I wouldn\u2019t expect that and then similarly on the fabricated side better profitability, but a little lighter volume than we would have expected. Thanks. Mark Millett : Again our order book and our bidding rate is still very strong and must assure certainly we see huge strong second half. Relative to structural, I think our actual order of structural beams in the second half were slightly off. Our actual market share relative to domestic produces actually increased because imports have been just progressively successfully increasing quarter-over-quarter. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Gambardella : Yes, good morning and congratulations on the quarter and the process. Mark Millett : Thank you. Good morning, Michael. Michael Gambardella : I have a question thought on your market share and if you could just -- if you could just take a look at your flat roll shipments were up 24% quarter-on-quarter and while, your scrap -- you mentioned your scrap cost didn't go down as much as the selling prices clearly they went down lot more than the iron ore cost of imports and your domestics integrate competitor. So you must be gaining some market share. Can you give us some color on that in your flat roll business? Mark Millett : Well I guess the broad numbers would suggest that Michael. I think we are -- we don't necessarily specifically culprit that or analyze it on a very specific month by month basis. But I would say, yes we're picking up market share at a what I would consider a reasonable selling value without sacrificing profitability on margin necessarily due to additional volume. Michael Gambardella : And on the flat roll side of the business, how much more volume capability do you have in reserve that you could possibly push out in the second half of the year? Mark Millett : The utilization there, I don\u2019t have the\u2026 Dick Teets : Well we\u2019ve -- let\u2019s say the text and again that\u2019s not molding capacity but coating capacity and we're probably operating at about 70% to 75% of capacity and all three lines running at little less or little more than three crews worth. We're looking at addressing more on those lines by adding some new products and new opportunities there to boost it up. We're not sitting ideally by just limping along but we're excited about an opportunity there, but there is about 25% of texts and if we had, we actually said, that's about a million ton or some thousand. We would say that\u2019s 200,000 tons of idle coating capacity and we do have some capacity down at Columbus, but others running too faster for months now. Right now we're down for a five-day outage. We pulled our maintenance outage ahead. It was supposed to be in October, but we found cracks on our melt shop -- our melt shop cranes and we're addressing those right now and so we won\u2019t take maintenance outage again until the spring. And so we're pulling all of our larger products soon and so we're comfortable with that, but then we will be back and going full strength again. So there is no real capacity available at Butler. Theresa Wagler : So Mike, we have 7.2 million tons of total flat roll shipping capability and that includes detect, which if you think about it from that perspective, that\u2019s about 1.8 million to 1.9 million tons per quarter and I think in the second quarter we had total shipments of just under 1.6. So you got 200,000 to 300,000 tons on a quarterly basis, but if you look first half to second half obviously the first quarter utilization was down significantly. So there is more already in the second half than that. Michael Gambardella : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your questions. Phil Gibbs : Good morning. Good morning, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Mark, we saw a little bit of pick up in scarp in June and I think July has come off a little bit, but is it reasonable to think that in third quarter relative to the second quarter that we can see your raw material cost stay relatively flat or should we expect them to be up a little bit given the fact that scarp bounce in the middle of the year? Mark Millett : Well, I'll let Russ give you some color, but I think we don\u2019t see any massive shift downwards like another $100 or anything crazy, but Russ do you think a general erosion. Russ Rinn : I think the trend is definitely going to be down. I think you've got no exports. The strong dollars and limited exports and actually has encouraged some imports of scarp, which again is going to be really mean that excess scarp or scrap supply in the U.S. is going to be clinical, which logically puts pressure on the -- downward pressure on scrap price in the near term. Phil Gibbs : Are you thinking August is going to be a reasonable reset given what we see in the export markets right now given what at least the Turkey come of 50 to 55 in the last six weeks? Russ Rinn : I think the question is what's reasonable. I think from this perspective reasonable would be maybe different than mine, but no, I think certainly there will be a downward price pressure in August and probably the next couple of months. Phil Gibbs : Okay. And then in terms of the fabrication momentum, you're running up against a tough volume comparison in the second half of the year. Are we looking for fabrication volumes to be relatively in line with where they've been in the first half of this year or should they step up and try to compete with the volumes that you had in the second half of last year, because I heard you say earlier on the call that you have added some headcount. Theresa Wagler : From a volume perspective Phil, based on where the market would allow us, I think that we could see a second half that has pretty reasonable volumes and definitely higher than we've seen in the first half of this year. Phil Gibbs : Okay. And then just lastly here if I could, the recycling business Russ, how much of that $12 million or so profitability at OmniSource was driven by some of the work that you've done behind the sense to clean up some of these higher cost operations in the South, thanks? Russ Rinn : Well I don't know that we can point to a specific, but certainly we\u2019ve taken some steps in idling some shredders or some shredders and closing some unprofitable yards down in the south. We've also done that in the Midwest. So we continue to focus on again adjusting our business levels and our business is what the market would allow us to operate profitably and we still got some more to do. Phil Gibbs : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stacey Kerelska with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question. Stacey Kerelska : Good mornings, guys and congrats on a good quarter. My first question is how much of the $100 a ton decline in sequential pricing in the flat roll was due to mix and how much due to the lower market pricing? Russ Rinn : No, I think the question was how much of the $100 a ton was\u2026 Stacey Kerelska : Just for me to clarify that $101 per ton reduction was not flat roll specifically that\u2019s over all of our product lines. So that average pricing bodes across long products and flat roll products. So I need to clarify that. So how much was I guess the mix and how much was lower pricing. Was it more due to shipping more flats or\u2026 Theresa Wagler : I would suggest that it wasn\u2019t unbalanced to mix versus just lower pricing. We had lower pricing throughout in the mix. You're right, its flipped a little bit more the flat roll side equation, but I would say it was just more overall reduction pricing. Stacey Kerelska : Okay. And my second question has to do with your capacities in galvanized coded and painted products. Could you give us a little bit of color on how much do you have of those at Columbus, Butler and the tax currently? Mark Millett : The tax is a million tons. We're going to give you the exact numbers that we report here I think the way Theresa would like to\u2026 Theresa Wagler : So from a coding perspective, the tax has a million ton of galvanizing capability and at Butler we have 720,000 tons of galvanizing capability and 240,000 tons of painting capability. And at Jeffersonville, which we've included in the flat roll division results, we have an additional 300,000 tons of galvanizing and additional 190,000 tons of painting. And then at Columbus, we have about a little over a million tons of galvanizing capability and we will be adding the painting capability in 2017 and that will be about 250,000 tons of painting capability. Stacey Kerelska : Okay. Great. Thank you. And how do you think your positioned for the case and coated? Mark Millett : How do we think about it? Stacey Kerelska : Yes. How are you positioned, you just give us some of the capabilities you have. Mark Millett : We are positively inclined but we\u2019re able to stick to zero passage by the ITC in the commerce department we'll be scheduled to at least or scheduled to from account and duty perspective, give a ruling and late in August. Now again I\u2019ll tell you, they're understaffed and so many times they delay that and so forth. But I think we have a very, very strong case on the coated products and it will only get stronger as people start reporting their earnings for the second quarter. Stacey Kerelska : Great. Thank you, Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions. Jorge Beristain : Hey guys just to again recap and beat the dead horse here, what do you think the market is missing here in the sense that I think you guys clearly articulated that two-thirds of coated imports of five countries could be targeted with anti-dumping duties anywhere north of a 100% as early as August and yet we\u2019re not seeing accelerated buying from your end clients. So what do you read through to that? Is it that the market is expecting that maybe the countervailing duties will not be as strong as the recent collapse in Asian prices take in a little bit of that potential price hike away. Could you just comment as to what you think the market is seeing, because there seems to be a disconnect. Mark Millett : I think the -- Dick, you probably add more color, but from my perspective you still have a large inventory that has to be consumed. Again as you said earlier, the customer base is currently not -- they are reluctant to take a position. They're patching holes and you just see that the inventory levels are slowly coming down once we get back to the market and those imports are not available to them, I think is when you start seeing the price appreciation, Dick? Dick Teets : Yeah and again I think that again there will be a preliminary number possibly here by the end of August. So there is still time for some deliveries before that. And as we noted prices are still coming down, which mostly from the Chinese and so they\u2019re in almost total disregard, which will not only improve the duty calculation in the very end to the final determinations, but I think that people are expecting is a delay in that ruling that may go. It\u2019s theoretically it could be delayed until the end of December. And so they\u2019re hoping and anticipating that delay and still get some tons in before the hammer calls and so that\u2019s their right to do that, but once the anti-dumping act ruling comes, which is pretty firm in November, I think everything will firm up very quickly and no one will want to have steel on the water couple of weeks before either those two rulings. Jorge Beristain : Perfect, that helps tighten up the timing outlook. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lane with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Lane : Hi good morning all. Mark Millett : Good morning. Andrew Lane : Just one question here I would also like to ask about the fabrication segment, by my account we\u2019ve now seen margin expansion for six straight quarters and just really impressive results this quarter. Could you provide some color as to the texture of the improvement in non-res construction activity that you're seeing? Are there any particular project types or particular regions that have really been driving the pickup in activity? Thank you. Mark Millett : I think the problems that shifted last year there tended to be a lot of big bulk warehouse Amazon type construction that shifted to more institutional I do believe today and it's across a broader spectrum of construction segments. So it gives us optimism, but it\u2019s sustainable and again, we have certainly a plethora of bidding, engineering backlog on the tables. So we continue to see a strong market. Theresa Wagler : The one thing I would add to that Andrew is that we\u2019re at record strategy right now in the fabrication side of the equation. So you mentioned that in the last six quarters we keep seeing improved margins that weren\u2019t just about the volume side of the equation. So we\u2019ve been able to because of the strength of the market with prices that have stayed very steady and the raw material, which has been flat with steel has been declining. So that there\u2019s really been a benefit there and I\u2019m not sure that one should expect that we stay at record levels in the second half of the year necessarily, although I believe volume can more than offset that. Andrew Lane : Great, very helpful. Congrats on a good quarter. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead with your question. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. There have been reports in the trade press of Chinese billet exports to turkey near $100 a ton, and while this is a liquid contract, the LME steel billet future has been at $100 a ton for seven weeks. Why don't you buy some of those cheap Chinese billets and either run them through your long mills or chop them up and mill them as scrap? Mark Millett : While we like quality. John I think you raised a good point, but again that's a big step to take. We\u2019ve got some loyal dedicated employees doing some great things there and the improvement that we would see is I don\u2019t think will be massive, but\u2026 John Tumazos : Do you think the scrap prices we read in the trade publications are accurate given the overseas markets being in a different place in terms of pricing? Mark Millett : Well John I had seen the $100, I saw like $202 and I was doing my calculations going back through the metrics and beating on Russ and trying to figure out how I get lower cost scrap and strap in Roanoke and to compete because I\u2019m after them to trying to figure out how to move some billets little less extensively and so forth. But I\u2019ve never seen the $100 number and even $200 is the stressing, with the $202 or $210. So again I don\u2019t know how to even say on that. Again we were pressed to bring in Chinese coils to the text to quote and we had a customer who demanded it and when a customer demands it and it\u2019s only part of the portfolio, originally I had said no, but I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize the value of that customer's business. It\u2019s been long standing and we had our tough times supplying any other reasonably priced products. I was willing to take a hit on certain amount of the product, but then truth be told, after -- it was after Sparrow's Point went away and the light gauge became a tighter market and people -- it was a tough time to find the product, when we brought some in and think goodness it's been run really well and the customer wasn\u2019t happy with the supply, but they're the ones who source it. So it wasn\u2019t us, but even that was the stressing, but I justified it because it kept our employee working and earning bonus and so forth, but any kind you start dabbling in that world you start worrying about me. I worry about the appropriateness of it because I\u2019m finding them every day in Washington through trade cases and so forth and how would I look to that was an importer of the same product and my customers not to enjoy the benefits of the cheap steel. John Tumazos : Some steel is out there at less than scrap values, you don't want the Chinese to be subsidizing your nice Turkish competitors when they could be subsidizing you instead. Mark Millett : We're not looking for the subsidy. We want the fair trade and we want to compete on the basis of what we do well and so we haven\u2019t considered that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Frank Duplak with Prudential. Please go ahead with your question. Frank Duplak : Good morning all. Just a quick one. You may have already done this, I hopped on and off the call. Have you guys updated your CapEx forecast for 2015? Theresa Wagler : We have Frank. We're expecting 2015 CapEx to be in the range of $150 million. Frank Duplak : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your questions. Phil Gibbs : Thanks. Just had a question, broad question for you Mark on M&A as to whether or not you see that as a potential in the next 6 to 12 months for your company or would you continue to do more of these internal investments like you've been doing and things like a downstream assets in Columbus? What's the priority for your company in terms of capital allocation within that view of M&A? Thanks. Mark Millett : Okay. Well, Phil as we spoke in the past, I think we frequently assess our cash allocation. We're blessed to have a phenomenal team doing phenomenal things in a challenging market and our cash generation remains incredibly strong and it\u2019s to your point what do we do with it. From a balance sheet standpoint its net leverage is under $2.4 million. We got liquidity of $1.6 million and so we got phenomenal foundation to grow. We will continue to consider to opportunities but, first going back to early this year, obviously we increased our dividend 20% or so, but to obviously with some of our value back to the shareholder. But from a growth standpoint, we continue to look at organic opportunities there. I would say few from a standpoint of capitalizing on the assets, but Roanoke has access metal capping capability obviously arguably as some excess metal capability. And so we\u2019re looking to optimize that and further diversifying and looking at that value-add sort of at that. On the MA front, I do believe there will be opportunities have been and will continue to be opportunities available to assess. Phil Gibbs : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like turn the floor back to Mr. Millett for any final and closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you, Brenda and again thank you, everyone. Just I guess to recap, SDI, I think is incredibly well positioned. We don\u2019t manage to hope, but we try and control our destiny. Obviously the important arena is little bit out of our control maybe, but we\u2019re certainly managing our business I think prudently. Low high variable cost structure and low fixed costs and highly divested product mix I think continues to generate strong cash flow through the cycle. I think we\u2019ve clearly differentiate ourselves. We have consistently outperformed our peer group and we'll continue to do so. We've talked about the latent capacity that we're yet to unleash in our steel capacity in total energy about a million tons and we\u2019ve got a million plus tons to truly leverage and are going to continue to capitalize on engineered bar expansion and our rail expansion and we\u2019re going to continue to capitalize on the contact position going forward. So we continue to partner with our terrific customer base and we've got a phenomenal team, I believe is passionate is driving whole company toward a new level of excellence. So we're fully engaged, fully focused, fully passionate and fully optimistic about our future and certainly appreciate your support, but you've given us in the past and do so currently and hope be with us for our growth in the future. So thank you everyone. Operator : Once again ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Marlene, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. 2015 continues to be an interesting challenge. But as often said, in adversity there is opportunity, and I think at least for those that have prepared for it. Significant industry shifts have taken place in both the global steel community, in raw material and product pricing, as well as recent preliminary trade case advancement. But before exploring our thoughts regarding the domestic steel landscape and how Steel Dynamics is uniquely positioned for growth, I ask Theresa to comment on the third quarter financial results. Theresa? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, one quick note. Consistent with how we're now managing the business, we've made a change to our reporting segment. The segment that we previously referred to as metals recycling and ferrous resources has been changed to just Metals Recycling. The previous segment included not only our metals recycling, our OmniSource operations, but also our two iron-making initiatives and another small 55% owned joint venture. Beginning with our third quarter earnings report, our Metals recycling segment will now only include OmniSource results. Iron Dynamics has been moved to our Steel segment, as 100% of its output is used at our Butler Flat Roll Division and the impact of Minnesota and the JV have been moved to other. The supplemental quarterly information reflects this change for all periods presented. For your convenience, we've also posted the quarterly 2013 and 2014 historical data in this format on our website, under Investors' Supplemental Financial Information. Now regarding our third quarter 2015 financial results. Net income was $61 million or $0.25 per diluted share, just above our guidance of between $0.20 and $0.24. These results compared to sequential adjusted second quarter 2015 net income of $53 million or $0.22 per diluted share and reported GAAP results of $32 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Third quarter 2015 consolidated revenues were $2 billion, approximately 3% less than the second quarter 2015 results, based on lower pricing and a 12% decline in external fair shipments from our metals recycling operations as well as lower steel shipments from our Flat Roll Group. Operating income was $131 million, compared to adjusted second quarter results of $120 million, representing a 9% improvement based on improved Steel margins and record setting Fabrication performance. For the third quarter of 2015, Steel shipments remained relatively unchanged at 2.2 million tons as the 4% decrease in our Flat Roll Group shipments were basically offset by a slight improvement in our Long Product operations. Despite slightly lower shipments, operating income increased as both average sales pricing and scrap cost improved in the quarter. Our average sales price increased $3 per ton, while our average cost of scrap used declined $3 per ton. As we indicated during our second quarter conference call, we expect the Steel imports to moderate in the third quarter and they did decline. However, higher customer inventories combined with continued high albeit decreased imports continued to cause downward pressure on steel prices especially in the Flat Roll arena. For our metals recycling platform, total third quarter 2015 ferrous shipments were relatively unchanged from the second quarter, however, internal shipments increased, 10% representing 59% as our total ferrous volume. Ferrous metal spread contracted 14% as the cost of procuring unprocessed material increased while selling values decreased. Additionally, although our non-ferrous shipments increased, non-ferrous metal spread declined 20%, as both copper and aluminum index prices fell in the quarter. As a result, our Metals Recycling operations third quarter operating income decreased meaningfully to a profit of $463,000 compared to $12.3 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our Fabrication operations continue to provide terrific results. The positive momentum in underlying non-residential construction demand, combined with our national presence and stellar customer service, resulted in another quarter of record performance metrics. Third quarter 2015 record operating income from our Fabrication platform was $37 million, 30% higher than their previous record achieved just last quarter. Record operating income per ton was $285, over 13% higher than second quarter performance. I'd also like to congratulate the Fabrication team on the acquisition of additional steel decking facilities from consolidated systems, which closed on September 14. The purchase price was $45 million, including net working capital of approximately $30 million, resulting in what we believe is a transaction price below fixed asset replacement value. Great job from the team. We incurred approximately $1.3 million of cost associated with the acquisition in the third quarter, most of which is included in non-segment operations within the Supplemental Quarterly Financial Table and with that other expense from the Consolidated Income Statement. We continue to see improvement in underlying non-residential construction demand, good news for all of our businesses as the construction sector historically is almost the largest domestic steel consumer. During the third quarter 2015, we continued to generate significant cash flow from operations of $164 million. Operational working capital was essentially unchanged and required $7 million in funding. Third quarter capital investments totaled $30 million. We estimate annual 2015 capital expenditures to be in the range of $120 million. Our preliminary estimate for full year 2016 capital investments is in the range of $250 million to $300 million, which includes the $100 million paint line addition at our Columbus Flat Roll Division that is expected to start operations in the first quarter 2017. Year-to-date 2015, we've generated $708 million of cash flow from operations and after CapEx, $622 million of free cash flow. We've maintained our quarterly cash dividends to shareholders which increased by 20% in the first quarter this year. Our history of increased quarterly dividend continues to demonstrate evidence of the confidence our Board of Directors have in the strength of our cash generation capability, financial position and optimism concerning our future. As demonstrated during the first nine months of 2015, throughout market cycles, our business model generates strong cash flow, based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations. Even after deleveraging our balance sheet and increasing cash dividends to shareholders beginning with the first quarter this year, we have record liquidity of $1.7 billion at September 30, 2015. Total debt declined slightly the $2.6 billion and a net debt of $2.2 billion decreased $61 million due to our free cash flow performance. The adjusted EBITDA in our press release schedule denotes the number we use for financial covenant purposes. Our third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $214 million and trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA $850 million resulting in a net leverage of 2.6 times. Our credit profile remains aligned with our preferred through-cycle net leverage of less than 3 times, a testament to our disciplined approach to growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook is incredibly flexible. We don't have any near-term meaningful maturities and those in the longer-term are well laddered and in the interim years have call provision flexibility. Looking forward, we believe that our capital structure and credit profile have the flexibility to not only sustain current operations but to support additional strategic growth investments. Thank you. Mark. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Super. Thanks Theresa. The safety and wealth of our employees is always top of mind and nothing is more important to us than creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Safety is at the forefront, integral to everything we do. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued diligence to work safely. Our safety performance is better than the industry average, but our goal remains squarely a zero safety incident work environment throughout all our locations. The team is doing a great job. Over half our locations achieved zero recordable injuries so far this year. We will continue to implement new initiatives and reinforce others to drive toward our ultimate goal of no injuries. Operationally, the team has performed well in the challenging environment. The ongoing flood of steel imports and elevated customer inventory levels continued to pressure steel product pricing and domestic steel producer volumes, most notably in commodity grade flat roll steel. Although commodity grade CIU average hot roll coil pricing fell in the quarter, our overall third quarter average steel selling price increased by $3 a ton compared to the second. Our value-add diversified product mix allowed better than industry performance. Somewhat improved average pricing coupled with lowest average scrap costs allowed our metal spreads and profitability to expand in the third quarter, despite lower steel shipments of approximately 2%. Our third quarter steel production utilization rate was 82% compared to 87% in what was a fairly robust second quarter. The production decline was driven by lower commodity grade hot roll coil shipments from our Butler division. However, our overall performance remains well above average domestic mill utilization. While our company-wide exposure to the energy sector approximates only 8%, it is higher at our recently acquired Columbus flat roll steel mill, which has been particularly impacted by both imports and reduced energy sector steel consumption. As you may recall, our first order of business and after buying Columbus was to significantly expand market and product diversification, moving toward a greater number of customer relationships and a broader mix of value added products serving more industries. The teams are making tremendous progress in automotive and construction related products. We're also making good progress in potential export opportunities into Mexico. 94 new customers have been added. Market shifts take time, but our planned paint line and Galvalume addition on Columbus campus will be a significant catalyst. The $100 million investment will provide approximately 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and further diversification into higher margin products for Columbus. We already have two paint lines and a Galvalume capability in Indiana, but this project allows for a higher product quality, double-wide steel and access to the Southern markets, including Mexico. We plan to sell surface-critical, appliance-grade steel as well as construction-related products. Operations are expected to begin during the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, we continue to improve Columbus' operating costs and product breadth and quality capabilities. During the third quarter of 2015, Columbus served 46% more value added galvanized steel compared to the first quarter of this year, and achieved record production results from those lines. Just less than 50% of Columbus' shipments were hot roll coils, almost a 10% shift in the beginning of the year. We continue to see the benefit of collaboration between our Columbus and Butler flat roll steel mills. Along with production and process successes, since the acquisition, Columbus is focused on implementing significant cost reduction initiatives with many more in the works. We have realized that at least $15 million in sustainable annualized cost savings so far in 2015 with identified plans for at least another $15 million in 2016. In addition, we anticipate continued benefit from the progressing product mix shift. Additionally, our steel platform continues to benefit from our organic growth and investments, including the addition of premium rail capability, our expanded engineered special bar quality capacity which has provided product diversification and aided mill utilization in this tough market environment for the structural mill. The planned increase in flat roll pickling capacity through the new push pull pickle line being installed at Butler will increase their downstream value add volume capability in 2016. Metal recycling platform profitability, meaningfully deteriorated in the third quarter, compared to a $12 million operating profit in the second quarter, we were just above breakeven for the third quarter, the erosion driven by significantly lower metal margins. Not what we would like to see, but a solid performance by the team against the tough market backdrop. Our ferrous metal margins declined approximately 14%, while non-ferrous margins declined 20%. Non-ferrous market indices have fallen over 10% in the third quarter and spreads have contracted substantially. The recycling environment remains challenging. The continued significant overcapacity of shredders, particularly in the Southeast and the U.S. continues to constrain margin as processors are all competing for the same material. Additionally, scrap export levels have fallen in the past two consecutive years to volumes significantly lower than recent historical norms. With the expectation of a continued strong U.S. dollar reducing scrap exports and the resulting ample scrap supply, we don't see likely drivers for significant increases in ferrous scrap prices in the near term and believe the market is essentially bottomed. The fabrication platform continues to achieve record operational and financial performance. Third quarter 2015 operating results of $37 million surpassed the previous record by 33%, which was achieved during this year's second quarter. Through the third quarter of 2015, the team has generated $86 million of operating income, 184% more than last year's year-to-date $30 million record. The team is executing on all fronts, doing a phenomenal job. Our September acquisition of additional decking assets further supports our growth strategy by enhancing New Millennium's position as the leading North American provider of steel, joist and deck. It will accelerate our growth and diversification into new steel deck parts. By increasing our deck production capability and sales, we plan to better match our joist market share of approximately 34%. In 2014, our deck market share was only 24%, so it's definitely an opportunity for growth, initiative to supply the catalyst. Additionally, the acquisition provides an opportunity for increased utilization on our Columbus Flat Roll Division. Over the last three years, the acquired operations averaged over 60,000 tons of annual steel purchases, predominantly flat roll galvanized steel most of which from other suppliers. This volume can be substantially sourced internally, which would help shift Columbus' product mix, boost utilization and compressed conversion costs. The New Millennium team continues to perform exceedingly well, both in market share gain and leveraging our national footprint. It is the credit to the foresight and positioning work the team did over the past several years. Based on sustainable increased demand and market share gain, we have added production shifts at several of our plants, creating more jobs in our local communities. The strength of this business provides positive insight into the continued growth in non-residential construction activity. Relative to the macro environment, the U.S. has steady demand dynamics in place. Forecast for the two largest domestic steel consuming sectors, automotive which historically represents about 25% of total U.S. steel consumption, and construction which is represented by 40% of total U.S. steel consumption in the past, both remained good. Automotive has continued forecasted strength and overall construction spending continues to trend favorably. SDI has growing exposure to both of these sectors through our Columbus Flat Roll Division, additional long products production capability and our growing Fabrication operations. Annualized at (19:09) the current domestic demand is reasonably strong, at about 120 million tons to 125 million tons. It is not demand that is our industry's challenge, it is squarely the excess levels of unfairly traded imports. Other countries are exporting their own financial problems to America. Excessive steel import volume combined by high customer inventory levels has limited U.S. steel mill utilization and pressured domestic steel pricing. While SDI's production utilization remains well above our peers and the industry in general, there is certainly more to be done. The continued decline in scrap prices has resulted in a stalled customer order activity. As everyone waits on the side lines until the scrap market stabilizes. The scrap flow remains good and the strength of the U.S. dollar should continue to impede the export market. Consequently, there doesn't appear to be any strong driver for ferrous scrap price appreciation, which is certainly good for Steel Dynamics. Again, we expect a relatively flat scrap market in the months ahead. We believe the fundamentals are supportive of a continued positive trend and economic growth in the U.S. In contrast, the current unimpressive global growth combined with a severe worldwide excess in steel capacity will promote imports and continue to be an industry headwind to steel pricing and utilization. However, we've seen import levels have consistently receded year-to-date, and the trade cases under review will likely reduce them further. Reduced imports, idling of domestic capacity along with upward trending demand should create a positive pricing environment that should allow some room for price appreciation going into 2016. As raw material prices remain at lower levels and production utilization improves, there is margin expansion opportunity. Importantly, as we typically do, we're not waiting around. In order to help insulate ourselves from imports, part of our strategy is to not only develop strong customer relationships but to also manufacture products that are more difficult to compete with on a global basis, such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ steel and longer length premium rail. As such, we are able to mitigate some of the import impact, and with our broad portfolio of value-added products, maintain highest steel mill utilization rates when compared to our peers. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we are focusing on opportunities to maximize our financial performance. We believe our superior operating and financial performance clearly demonstrates the sustainability of our business model throughout the market cycle. In these challenging times, our low, highly variable cost structure coupled with a highly diversified value added product portfolio will continue to generate significant cash flow. As we look ahead, we continue to be optimistic regarding our own future. Columbus is one aspect of the story, and our organic growth products is another. We have a solid financial foundation, and an outstanding liquidity profile providing a unique position for growth as opportunities arise. We will concentrate on opportunities that will improve the quality of our margins with a particular focus on downstream, value-added growth to mitigate imports, and inevitable cyclicality of our business. The strong character and determination of our employees are unmatched. They are a phenomenal group, and I am proud to stand with them in these challenging times and look forward to creating new opportunities with them in the months and years ahead. I thank each one and remind them, safety is always the top priority. Again, thank you for your time today. And Manny, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. And with that, our first question is from Tony Rizzuto of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. Hi all. Got a couple questions. First of all... Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Tony. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey Mark. Good results in a very challenging environment. My first question is how should we think about your fourth quarter metal margins with all the moving parts. Scrap has plummeted again and there has been more broad-based selling price weakness. How should we think about that? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There certainly continues to be import pressure, Tony. And as I said, imports are continuing to recede. They have sort of almost month-over-month through the year. I think with the one exception, July just popped up a little bit. We do believe the trade cases will further improve that situation, although the timing of that is a little uncertain. I think, Dick can speak to the trade cases in a second, but the timing is kind of extended out to the end of the timeframe. And so, when the impact of that occurs is, I guess, anyone's guess. I do think margin expansion in the fourth quarter is tough, but I think there is certainly a positive pricing environment going into 2016, and with a flat scrap arena I think there is margin expansion certainly in 2016. Whether that occurs or not in the fourth quarter is doubtful. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. It's very helpful. Dick, do you want to add something there that Mark indicated or...? Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : All I could add is that, looking at the license data for August and September, there is a couple of bad actors that sort of are thrusting a few of their extra tons this way, but quite a few of the countries have been moderating their tons. And so, the slope of the imports have been decreasing through the second quarter and third quarters. So, I think the trade cases are getting the traders' attention, even though preliminary determinations have been pushed off into the December timeframe. I do believe that overall, things are improving in the marketplace. So, they will begin to make some difference not necessarily whole lot in the fourth quarter but rolling into 2016. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. That's very helpful, both of you. Thank you. My second is, I was surprised to see the magnitude of sequential decline in shipments at Butler. I think they were down about 11.5% sequentially and then in rail, which was down about 14% and obviously the imports affecting HRC shipments. Was there anything else going on at Butler during the quarter, I just want to check on that? And then rail shipments have been improving quite nicely over the past three quarters, four quarters and I was a little bit surprised that they were down, but just wanted to get your view of that and how we should think about going forward here? Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Let me first \u2013 I'll address the rail. Actually from a rail perspective, I think railroads adjusted orders a little bit. October is usually when they start placing orders for the next calendar year. So, I think that they were really looking forward to what was going to happen in 2016. I could tell you that we already surpassed the production of our Continuous Welded Rail in the third quarter that we did in the total year of 2014, and that we expect to ship 265,000 tons of rail in all of 2015, which would be a record for us. And so, I think things are going well there. And we'll also look at shipping 150,000 tons of Welded Rail. So, again, extremely well. So, I think the rails everything is healthy and fine there. At Butler, again things turned down as basically the spot market on hot band is not a lot \u2013 there wasn't that much out there and the stuff that was out there was at prices that we just weren't interested in it. There is a line that you draw and with our variable costs at such a high level, we've said before that 80% of our costs are variable. And so, I think some companies need cash. We are not a company that is on survival mode, and so cash isn't what we require, and so we don't chase them. And so, we pull maintenance and do a few other things, but we didn't need the market share approach. Theresa, do you want to? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Tony, I would just add if you \u2013 where the weakness was with, I'd only (29:00) reiterate what Dick said, it was really in the hot band. If you look at the value-added line, they operated at basically the same levels that they operated in the second quarter, and second quarter actually Butler operate at over 100% capacity... Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Yeah, we are... Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a little difficult to compare. Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Yeah. But we have a bottleneck. I mean, we are backlogged through our pickle line and we're looking forward to the startup of our second pickle line at the beginning of 2016. And so therefore, we couldn't put anything through. We're running at over 98% in total utilization through our complete cold mill complex at Butler. And so therefore, the only thing that was not running full was the hot metal. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Matthew Korn of Barclay's. Please go ahead. Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning everybody. Thanks, for taking my call. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, let me ask, Mark, with imports and shipments both falling apparently, how much of the incremental order softness is really coming from imports taking additional market share, if that's actually happening for a certain products in certain regions? And how much of it is this \u2013 that are these lower global prices that are causing the deflationary expectations really setting in among buyers? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, it is truly difficult to discern whether the issue is underlying demand or just total excess inventory levels. From our perspective, underlying demand still remains in many areas and I won't say is robust and phenomenal but it certainly hasn't deteriorated by any great degree. There is a significant inventory out there. You see that in the recent MSCI data and unfortunately that data doesn't reflect material that is at the port. Obviously, a lot of the material is hot rolled coil and that's where we're seeing the principal softness. The customer base, I think, as I said earlier, is just stalled. They were expecting a price decline here this month. Obviously scrap came off $50 or so and they are essentially waiting sort of stabilization or at least transparency as to where that level ends up. And again, as I said earlier, we believe the scrap market is somewhat bottomed and should be essentially flattish in the weeks ahead, certainly not going up, but sort of soft sideways. Matthew James Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Let me follow-up with Graham on the Fabrication division. Of course, very good result for the quarter. Now, at your recent analyst event you mentioned that kind of region-to-region you're seeing some fluctuations in demand levels, good in the South, out West, maybe some less good out in the East. But, you are seeing overall order rates in line with normal seasonality. Now this quarter I saw year-over-year volumes did end up falling pretty substantially. Is that a slowdown in project, certain (32:26) activity or is that competitive pressures or the downstream customers, are they showing the same type of kind of stalled out expectations on price? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Chris? Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: That's more of a competitive pressure in our regional basis. We see the overall joist market still has grown. We've had one or two plants in Midwest and East where there is a more of a concentration of producers. To your point, Texas and California still remain, far and away, the most robust markets that we're participating in. The Midwest and the Northeast did not grow at the rates that the West did and the Southwest, and hence we seemed to feel a little more competitive pressure in those areas this year than historically we've experienced. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Evan. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: First question is on SBQ. It looks like your Engineered Bar shipments were up, which I thought was a pleasant surprise given that the pure play SBQ producer in the industry got in for some severe kind of demand shipment weakness in the third quarter. Could you give us a little bit of color on what might have happened there, were you able to take share, was it end-market exposure? What caused that? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, obviously that arena has seen some softness recently. For us, we've seen a little deterioration in our book, energy-related heavy equipment agriculture, but that has been largely offset by the expansion into the lower diameter SBQ. It would have been nice for that expansion to be increasing volume over last year, but in this tough environment it's kind of replacing that and keeping things relatively flat. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, it's helpful. And maybe a question for Ross. What are you seeing as far as scrap collection behavior at these sorts of price levels particularly after this last October drop? Is there money to pay peddlers to go out and collect, are they exiting the business? How are smaller feeder yards faring in this environment? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President- Metals Recycling : Evan, thanks for the question. As we look at the world we live in, certainly these lower price drops have created some problems, particularly for the obsolete grades of scrap, and we're seeing some reduced flows in some areas of the obsolete scrap collection. Again, if you can just put in perspective, a year ago, one year ago, the prices that we were able to get for scrap out in the marketplace was double what it is today. And so, over the year's time, our market price has been cut in half. So certainly, that's put financial duress on many of the dealers and collectors out there and it's also made it, in some cases unaffordable for people to collect scrap and bring it in. So there has been some impact particularly on the obsolete grades and we have seen some instances where if you look at the American metal market, over the last six months or so, you've got some folks that have exited the business and we also are seeing the phenomenon of some areas where people are walking away from the accounts because they are underwater. So, again, this reinforces the bottoming out of the scrap market. And again, as Mark said, I think we're looking relatively flat from my perspective, going forward, for the next several months. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Yu of Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Good morning. On the... Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Brian. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. On the Fabrication business, I know the results there have been doing quite well and you've got a 21% operation margin there, and in the press release you talked about benefits from lower steel cost. Is there a way to try to quantify what the benefit is of lower steel cost or maybe another way, is there a longer term sustainable operating margin percentage that we can think about for the Fab business? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Brian, as we've said, I guess, probably the last three quarters in a row, because each quarter has been a record quarter, we're trying to help you with rationalizing that number because, to your point, we're actually operating at what we'd consider record spreads today and that's been the \u2013 Fabrication has been a beneficiary of rapidly decreasing scrap \u2013 or steel prices. As that moderates, they're actually now bidding on jobs that don't have kind of real steel prices with real products pricing as well, which they're starting to get some pressure on that side of the equation. So, yes, the third quarter probably shouldn't be what you use for a through-cycle margin for Fabrication. I believe the operating income per ton for them, which is kind of how we looked at it in the third quarter was $285, EBITDA per ton was actually I think like $308 per ton. That would suggest that's very much on the high side of the equation and numbers that we've not seen here Q4. But for that to be in the $200 range probably on an operating income per ton isn't something that is unfathomable for a through-cycle type number. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think it should be pointed out that, again, through-cycle, the future is certainly not like it would be if you look at it on a historical basis. That industry has consolidated dramatically. We have a national footprint there having \u2013 sort of restarted three of the CMC assets, we got 34%, 35% market share in joist and there are essentially only three principal players there. And so that will bode well and the future through-cycle earnings are going to be certainly much, much better than the past. On the decking side, market share has been lower and typically you kind of sell a ton of deck for a ton of joist, give or take a little bit, but we've been around that 24% market share percent in deck. Obviously the acquisition of the CSi assets will act as a catalyst to boost that up and we'll get parity, we do believe, quite quickly between joist and deck. So, it's an exciting business. And again, my hats off to the team. They made some decisions several years ago and they build upon that and it's a good platform for us. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. And then the follow-up question separately is just on your utilization rates here, as you mentioned, it was quite high, and probably close to 90% in the third quarter. Say your competitors are looking to idle some of their blast furnaces, does this open up some opportunities for you guys to maybe grab a little bit more market share and keep that utilization rate at high levels in what is typically a seasonally soft fourth quarter? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say, absolutely. I think there is a potential. Again, we got a phenomenally low cost, highly variable cost structure that we can take advantage of. The rationalization should allow greater utilization of other assets that are operating. And also, we still expect imports to continue to come back. So it should be a good market environment for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Timna Tanners of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hey, good morning. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Timna. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, just wanted to dig in a little bit more and I know you said on the call in your commentary that this isn't a demand problem, it's a problem of imports. But there have been some recently reports from other companies in the industrial sector in particular, in some construction highlighting potential weakness. So I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color of what you are hearing from your customers, a little more granularity please? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, if you look at the principal markets, Timna, obviously a couple of them are pretty stagnant and weak, energy remains slightly poor as is mining, off-road and agriculture. But in other areas, we'd not necessarily assume any great weakness or deterioration. Automotive continues to be strong I think. We have intelligence there through our scrap management programs and relationships, the stampers are still stamping and cars are still being produced. So we don't see anything to get overly concerned about there. Truck, trailer, material handling, it's a peak year for us, but it's \u2013 no near-term change over the next quarter. Manufacturing for us is okay. That would be perhaps one area that could be under pressure given the strong dollar, but we're not necessarily seeing that yet ourselves. And we still remain incredibly optimistic on the non-residential construction side of our business. We see it through New Millennium Building Systems for sure. The beam markets are okay, a little under pressure, but again the imports have been picking up there. But from a standpoint of our customers, I spent some time at METALCON last week, which are principally sort of value-add coated and pre-paint customers. The building products folks suggesting that 2015 that they're up 12% year-over-year over 14%, and they see continued strength through 2016. So I wouldn't say I'm doing cartwheels down the hallway, but we're optimistic that things are \u2013 they're certainly not deteriorating. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. I guess I also just wanted to ask in light of that downstream strength that you've been highlighting, is that still a preferred use of cash and cash generation has been quite strong. Any updated thoughts on the opportunities there? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think just at a high level, from a cash allocation perspective, we've positioned ourselves over the past year to make sure that we've got some dry powder and a strong leverage profile to take advantage of, I think, core strength opportunities that are going to befall us over the next 12 months. We expect to maintain the positive dividend profile that we've seen in the past. Obviously, we boosted that 20% early in the year as a reflection of the step-up cash flow generation from Columbus, but we would hope to see that being positive going forward. And we'll continue to repay debt as appropriate to comfortably stay within our 3 times net leverage. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, Mark, Theresa, Dick. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Good morning. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And Russ, and Chris, you're all there. Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President- Metals Recycling : They are all here. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I saw that about 60% of the ferrous scrap that you sold was to your own steel mills. I think historically that's been around 50%, so a pickup here in the quarter. Should we expect that to continue right now? Is that more of an imperative for you to get that that percentage up in this market or was it a just bit of a, just one quarter, and we shouldn't read too much into it? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President- Metals Recycling : Well, Phil, I'd tell you that as, again, the one thing that you've got to keep in mind is whether the scrap is at steel mills or it's in our scrap yards, SDI owns the scrap. So it is certainly in our best interest to make sure we utilize the working capital, we've got already in place to do that. So, again, I think the function of what we supply internally versus externally is really market related and again demand related based on what the demand of not only our internal mills are, but external mills, so it naturally will flow depending upon where that demand is. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. And then on the energy side, are your major sheet buying customers particularly in the South giving you any indication when things may pick up for them in terms of their buys? I know they're probably a couple quarters away, but what are they telling you in terms of timing when they may look to procure a bit more steel. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Dick, you may have a different impression, but I would suggest that it's quite a ways out. There's some business in sort of larger transmission type projects out there, but from the standpoint of just basic energy pipe, ERW type line pipe, it's going to be quite a while. We kind of have to come up and the inventory have to dissipate before anything meaningful happens. Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : That's right. Again, the Columbus mill, as you just pointed out though, we ran the hot mill at about 83%, 84% utilization. So the tonnage isn't bad. Need to say the sales prices on where we want it, but the ton has been okay. A lot of that had to do with the increase in number of customers you pointed out, the 90-plus new customers, most of them were trying to direct forwards through the cold mill and the galvanizing line and so forth. We're doing quite well with new automotive enquiries and so forth and we've gotten some new platform work already for 2016. We've received another automotive company platform work last week. I'm very pleased with that. That doesn't necessarily translate to shipment for the fourth quarter of this year, but we continue to be awarded work for next year. But we're going to continue to try to move work through the galvanizing lines through value-add and so forth. But as you pointed out, there is not a rebound in the energy sector yet and those hot band tons that we are producing, what we really want to do is increase the value. We made shipments of X70, and so I think we're the first mini mill to successfully supply X70 grade line pipe substrate to the market, and we're extremely pleased with the efforts by the whole team down at Columbus on that success. And we look forward for their continued supply of that and development of additional grade. So we're working hard down there. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And not to be redundant, but I think the team needs to be congratulated. We knew we have to diversify that product portfolio when we purchased Columbus about just a year and a week \u2013 a year and two weeks. But they've done a phenomenal job in a tough market. It would have been nice for the energy market to have been sustainable for a year-and-a-half whilst we did it. But hey, it is what it is. But to boost our customer base by 94 customers or so and worked incredibly well with our existing customer base to expand exposure there. And to Dick's point, I'm amazed at our automotive team. As we may have mentioned in the past, we've changed our supply \u2013 sort of supply chain there and going direct, they got seven or eight very, very capable young men and women there and their penetration of that market is \u2013 in such a short time is... Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Phenomenal. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...is phenomenal. And also the production team down there, we challenged them to push the equipment to go lighter, to go wider on the high-strength, low-alloy grades; getting to the X70 type pipe grades, and they've responded incredibly well. And it's all reflecting in the utilization of that mill in a very, very tough environment. It's a reflection of the record coated shipments production activity that they've been able to accomplish there. So seriously, my hats off to the folks there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Aldo Mazzaferro of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Can you hear me? Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Yeah. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can hear you, Aldo. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Oh, great. Sorry, I thought \u2013 okay. So this might be a question for Theresa. Your average selling price actually went up a few bucks sequentially. And I would bet there's the shift between the flat roll being a little softer in the mix and the bars being stronger and the rail stronger had a mix effect. Can you break out a little bit what the mix effect was in the quarter on a per ton basis? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Aldo, we purposely try not to get into that granularity by products for obvious reasons on the average selling price perspective. I'll tell you that it is mix related. As you will notice, when we talked about it for \u2013 Butler is a great example as their hot band actually decreased, the mix shifted much higher to the value-add side, which actually impacted their average selling price very positively. And you just saw that shift throughout the product chain for us in the steel perspective. We feel that that is pretty sensitive commercial information, so it's hard for us to share that. I apologize. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I get it. That's okay. Thanks. A follow-up question then on the \u2013 Mark, on your comments about margins being tough to improve in the fourth quarter. If scrap goes sideways from here on an index basis, wouldn't there be some \u2013 at least a little bit of a lag effect, where you'd see a declining usage cost in the fourth quarter? And if that's true, would that imply that you're thinking junk prices might go down in the fourth quarter for you? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I guess, my comment is just marginally in general. There's certainly a flow through of scrap, not quite as steep as we'd like to see it because operating rates aren't maxed out there. But I guess my concern is what is the relative rate of decline of our scrap input cost relative to product pricing, and the product price environment is a little (53:42) right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Mark, and everybody. Mark, could you provide any insight through your legal team as to why we saw this delay in the determination of the countervailing duties on hot roll sheet by commerce department? That's my first question. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I'm going to pass that over to my legal Washington expert, Mr. Teets. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Well, I think really all the delays are due to the fact that I think there is about 135 cases between countervailing and dumping that have been filed since June, and it's just a massive amount of data that's being collected from everybody and it's an overloaded situation. So everything has been pushed back to basically the latest dates available to them for making their preliminary determination. So when we had filed, we knew the earliest dates and we knew the final dates and I think just about everything pointed towards the later dates being the timeframes in which to expect results. So I don't think anyone is really surprised. And I do believe mostly the traders expected it too and hence why in some of the higher levels of imports coming in from some of the countries that are still being maintained, because they expected not to be caught at this time with the shipments coming because they knew that trade cases determination is going to occur until the later dates, or they were quite sure of that. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. But those duties are retroactive to the point of filing, are they not? Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : No. No, no, no. Only if there was a \u2013 only critical circumstances would be determined and that hasn't been determined in any cases. So they only are as of the point of the date of the determination normally. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. My other question is for Mark, and maybe he could just comment as to what you are hearing maybe in Washington or just at an industry level feeling. But is the ball kind of back in the court of the U.S. steel companies? Is Washington or industry kind of being forced to look to itself and say, what can they do to fix the issue and it kind of comes back to consolidation. I guess, my question is, can the industry in your opinion support another round of large scale consolidation or are we kind of technically at the point where electric arc furnaces has, most end clients have two or three options within a certain radius and imports, same thing on integrated. And I'm just wondering if you could just talk about, can the current issue in the steel industry be fixed by for the consolidation. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, firstly going to your comment of Washington, I think generally the \u2013 there is political support for our industry. I think there's definite support and you see that in the new language going through the TPP in the customer's bill. Is I am right, Dick? Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Right. The TPA. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: TPA, sorry. So there is a positive stance there. Some of the margins on the duties that we've seen particularly on pipe (57:33) perhaps a little disappointing to some. But given the cost structure, the strength of the dollar, devaluation of the won, devaluation of the ruble, lower oil price, they're starting off at a very low basis. But generally, our impression or our thought belief is that trade cases are going to be positive, varying duties to varying countries, but nonetheless a positive for our industry and imports will recede and we've already seen that. I think the corrosion-resistant license \u2013 import licenses... Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Are down. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...were down. Actually imports were down and then the licenses were down quite dramatically. So they will have an effect. Will that effect be substantial enough to change the market strength to a degree that some of the challenged players can sustain themselves? I think that's an open question. Obviously, folks are looking inwardly to survive and get through this. You're seeing that AK, U.S. is certainly doing some strong things to resolve their woes and that will bring some rationalization at least near term for the next \u2013 these plants are not likely to go away, but certainly the volumes are going to come out of the market and generally utilization of our industry will pick up from that. So a combination of lower imports, some rationalization, I think that will reflect in a more positive environment. Will that get us up to utilization near term to 85% or 82% or low 80%s that you really need for material margin expansion? Don't know. Certainly take us in the right direction there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just another quick one on trade cases. Just thinking with all these delays, have you been able to amend the initial filing with some of the incremental data, I mean, (60:11) prices are really falling off the cliff since you initially filed a lot of these cases, is there any way to incorporate that into the process so that the DOC comes up with maybe a stronger margin? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, there is no mechanism to allow that to occur. It's the window in which the case was originally filed upon is what the data that's submitted and that's the data you live with. Hindsight is always 20/20, Evan. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from John Tumazos of Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you. Do you believe the scrap market will recover enough for you to earn a good return on your recycling assets or should we expect that you consolidate carry less inventory and otherwise reduce the assets employed? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: John, I would tell you, I think if you look back in history with the exception of the 2000s, we are pretty much back to levels where scrap prices were created and historically going back in the 1900s, last century to put it that way. Dick was looking at me like I'm crazy. Sorry. Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : 1901. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: 1901. But, again I think the scrap business was a viable business at those levels in the not too distant past. The business itself has just got to readjust itself to the levels of the market that the market is going to last. Does that mean further consolidation or people dropping out of the business, it could. But again the flow and the amount of scrap generated in the United States is relatively stable. And so, that flow whether it comes through OmniSource or it comes through somebody else is likely to be there. So, again I think we just got to look at a new reality in our business and deal with it. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : But when you say that the recycling industry in general is under extreme financial stress... Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All you have to do is look at the American metal market and see the guys dropping out weekly. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : So, there is certainly \u2013 it doesn't happen overnight, but certainly material rationalization is going to happen over the next two years, three years. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think so. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Justine Fisher of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Justine B. Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Richard P. Teets - Director, EVP-Steelmaking, President & COO- Steel Operations : Good morning. Justine B. Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, it seems that the service centers are a big problem in terms of demand at the moment, because demand from some of the end markets are still pretty good, but inventories are pretty high, we just don't have the buying that it seems that we need to have in order to get things going again. And so, what do you guys think that service centers need to see in order to get them buying again? I mean, is it just the working down of (63:18) inventories in that fit or do service centers need to get much more bullish on overall demand themselves or do they need to see international prices stabilizing before they say, okay, we'll buy domestically instead of looking to those imports? I mean, what do you think the service centers are looking for? Because it seems as though that that's one of the big demand problems because everyone talks about end markets; the end markets seems to be generally fine. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think, I can almost start saying, yes, yes, yes and yes, to a whole a lot of those items. But I think there's been of course a general shift from all the end markets. Everybody has, I think taken a breath from levels of inventories that they intended to carry until they have this assurance that there is not going to be another drop. And so, all the end users, the people that the service centers sell to have all decided that there is no concern that they can get what they need in a relatively short period of time and I don't believe it. Very few would be concerned about the just-in-time deliveries. So therefore, the end users, the OEMs and so forth believe that they have confidence in their service center suppliers. The service centers believe that they have confidence in their mill supply and so forth. And even some times the service centers, if they are concerned, they'll buy between themselves and to try to pull their inventories down. And so, it's a matter of all of those inventories at the OEM. And sometimes there is inventories being held like with our SBQ at forgers. There is middle people in the supply chain, that all have to be rationalized. And it's just a matter of a little bit of time. And so, once all of those become, I'll call the new normalized, the service centers will be buying. And I don't think that the spreads \u2013 the spreads will become I think more palatable between imports and the domestic mills. And things will get back to ordering once before, someone assured that the scrap price is flattened, as we believe it's going to be and it becomes more palatable to take a position. And so, then the service centers will step up a little more, but nobody is going to until the supply chain \u2013 the complete supply chain has pulled down their inventories a little bit more. Justine B. Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks for that, that's great color. And just to follow on, can you guys give us some color as to what your lead times are maybe across different products? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, like everybody, it's not real long. We're a couple of weeks on our hot band. We're a month and a half, two months. And again we're even longer than that on some of our finished products as we're sold out and we have a backlog sitting in front of our pickle line and Butler, we're shorter than that down in Columbus, because we do have openings there. We're fully sold out. Our hot mill at \u2013 number one mill at Columbia City is rolling at a 100% utilization, but our medium section mill there with smaller products is about probably a three-week to a month, but we sell probably about 40% of our total sales there, come out of inventory. Roanoke sells probably 50%, 40% out of rollings and rest out of inventory on bar and merchants, I think that's pretty traditional within that the industry for merchant bar so forth, but \u2013 and SBQ is basically all roll to order. And so, I would tell you there it depends on how much bar finishing goes through and bar finishing is sold solid. So I would tell you there is six weeks to two months. So I think we're fine where we are and Steel of West Virginia is basically full, has a little bit of time under one mill, but real full, mill shops are running full. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from David Lipschitz with CLSA. Please go ahead. David, your line is live. David A. Lipschitz - CLSA Americas LLC : Sorry, had the mute on. So I guess, my question is, the thesis over the summer when all the trade cases were coming was, prices are going to rally as soon as those things come because people are going to get nervous about prices rallying. In the meantime, prices have fallen pretty precipitously. When the trade cases are \u2013 the duties do come whatever they are, how quickly do you think people are going to react to it, because obviously people didn't react right away when the duties were announced to begin with \u2013 where the trade cases were filed? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think it's difficult to quantify. I would suggest that given that the pricing environment or the cost structure environment out there today of the importing countries, we're not going to see this kind of a precipitous drop in imports and sort of a nice exponential hockey stick improvement in pricing. I think I believe that it's going to be slow erosion of imports and a slowly an increasing sort of margin expansion pricing environment. But to quantify \u2013 to put dollars on it, I don't think we're that good. David A. Lipschitz - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Matt Murphy of UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question and apologies, if I missed it. Just wondering on the CapEx budget, you've got around a $110 million on your investments at Columbus, let's say a $120 million sustaining. I'm just wondering if the rest in particular, if you're going to hit the top range of guidance, is that more maintenance or is it actually investments in the business? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : From a maintenance perspective overall our business, we tend to look at it as about a $120 million for the year. And with paint line addition which is a $100 million that gets you to about $220 million. So, the bottom range is $250 million, so that would be like $30 million worth of additional type items top ranges is $300 million. If we were to get that top range of $300 million, that's going to be a margin enhancing, productivity enhancing, efficiency enhancing in other words, it will be higher return type investments, it will not be additional maintenance expense \u2013 expenditure, sorry. Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: And is the decision on that basically predicated on market conditions or are you whittling down some ideas? Just wondering if you see any areas that you think are attractive even in a soft market. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, actually the finalization of our capital plan doesn't take place until November, so that was just a real high level preliminary number, because they know everyone wants to see that going into trying the model 2016, as we get to the first quarter call, we'll have that refined, but yes, there are numerous projects that are on the table and everyone is buying for theirs to be able to be approved. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Millett for any closing comments. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, just for those that are remaining on the call, thank you for your support. We diligently try and do our best each and every day. Many of us are shareholders, in fact, all our employees are shareholders in one way or another and we will strive to create value each and every day. And to any customers on the call certainly appreciate your support and we will continue to track diligently for you. And to all our employees, thank you each and every one of you for phenomenal job this past quarter, this past year and we all emphasize, be safe each and every minute that you're right there. Thanks folks, have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Steel Dynamics' fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, President and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have our leaders from the company's operating platforms, including Dick Teets, President and Chief Operating Officer for our Steel Operations; Russ Rinn, President and Chief Operating Officer for our Metals Recycling Operations; and Chris Graham, President of our Fabrication Operations. Please be advised that certain comments made today may involve forward-looking statements about future events that by their nature are predictive. These are intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we refer you to a more detailed form of this statement contained in the press release announcing this earnings call. These predictive statements speak only as of this date, January 26, 2016, and involve many risks and uncertainties related to our businesses and the environment in which they operate, any of which may cause actual results to turn out differently than anticipated. More detailed information about such risks and uncertainties may be found in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K under the heading, special note regarding forward-looking statements and risk factors; and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or in other reports which we from time to time file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Tricia (2:18), perfectly done \u2013 thank you \u2013 during your first call. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I wish each and every one of you health and happiness in 2016. 2015, as we look back, turned out to be a period of considerable challenge. Significant industry shifts took place in the global steel community as both product and raw material prices weakened dramatically and the U.S. became the preferred home for unfairly traded steel. That said, we believe the existing landscape provides a unique opportunity for Steel Dynamics. We are well-positioned with record liquidity, a strong balance sheet, things most others in our industry today cannot say. But before explaining further, I ask Theresa to comment on our results. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great. Thank you, Mark. Before getting started, I do want to welcome Tricia Meyers. (3:06) She's our Investor Relations Manager. She's just starting. She's been with the company for quite some time, since 2008. And we're very excited to have her on board. So with that, talking a little bit about the results for the full year and for the fourth quarter of 2015. The reality of the excessive, unfairly traded steel imports during the entire year significantly reduced our overall earnings. However, despite this, we again achieved record performance that surpassed our industry peers and we generated record levels of annual cash flow. The year also had other record achievements with the inclusion of Columbus for one full year of operations, which had 8.3 million tons of steel in the year, 13% higher than last year. The fabrication team realized record shipments and operating income, well exceeding 2014's strong performance. And they generated a record $1 billion in cash flow from operations, resulting in record liquidity of $1.9 billion. For the full-year 2015, our adjusted net income was $178 million or $0.74 per diluted share, with adjusted operating income of $398 million. The adjustments include three items. During the first half of the year, we reported $17 million of refinancing fees associated with a $350 million debt repayment, and we recorded charges of $33 million related to idling our Minnesota operations and a significant maintenance outage at Iron Dynamics. The last and most recent item occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015. As indicated in our December 16 guidance, during the quarter, we performed our required annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. We concluded that the book value of the segment was impaired, resulting in non-cash goodwill and other related asset impairment charges of $435 million. These results compare to 2014 adjusted net income of $323 million or $1.35 per share, which also excludes certain non-cash charges, as outlined on our supplemental information page. On an unadjusted basis or GAAP basis, 2015 reported net loss was $130 million or $0.54 per diluted share compared to annual 2014 GAAP net income of $157 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Before the non-cash impairment charges, our fourth quarter 2015 net income was $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share, above the range of our adjusted guidance of between $0.03 and $0.07. Our adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $47 million compared to $131 million in the sequential third quarter. Fourth quarter 2015 consolidated revenues were $1.6 billion, 18% lower than the sequential quarter based on the lower steel shipment and average product pricing. For our steel operations, annual 2015 volumes expanded due to our Columbus acquisition, but metal spread meaningfully contracted. Our average annual sales price fell $152 per ton while our average cost of scrap used declined only $105 per ton. As a result, annual steel operating income for our steel operations decreased 41% to $412 million. During the fourth quarter, steel shipments decreased 11%, reduced across all divisions, but most notably in our Flat Roll Group. Imports although lower, customer inventory realignment and seasonality were all contributing factors. Combined with metal spread compression, steel operating income was much lower in the fourth quarter, decreasing 47% to $67 million. Our average sales price per ton decreased $51 while our average cost of scrap used declined $47 in the fourth quarter. For our metals recycling platform, the dramatic drop in global ferrous and non-ferrous commodity prices during 2015 resulted in significant metal spread contraction. Shipments also declined due to both lower domestic steel mill utilization and export demand. As such, prior to the impairment charges, annual 2015 metals recycling operating income decreased $48 million, resulting in a loss of $4 million. During the fourth quarter, metals recycling shipments decreased sequentially based on lower domestic steel mill production utilization and the traditional year-end steel mill scrap inventory reduction. Additionally, sequential quarterly ferrous scrap pricing decreased substantially resulting in a 34% margin reduction. Prior to the impairment charges, fourth quarter 2015 operating losses for the metals recycling segment was $16 million. Our fabrication operations achieved incredible annual operating financial results in 2015, earning record operating income of $116 million with record annual shipments. Full-year EBITDA per ton was also a record at $254, almost double 2014 results of $128 per ton. Steady joist and deck demand in an otherwise typically seasonal slow quarter, combined with market share growth from our recent deck asset acquisition, allowed for a 10% increase in fourth quarter fabrication shipments. Operating income did decline to $30 million from record levels set in 2000 \u2013 excuse me, set in the third quarter due to some market margin compression as average product pricing decreased more than raw material costs. We continue to see improvement in underlying non-residential construction demand. Good news for all of our businesses as construction sector is the largest domestic steel consumer historically. From a cash flow perspective, we generated record annual cash flows from operations in 2015 of over $1 billion and $924 million of free cash flow after fixed asset capital investments. Annual working capital provided $525 million of funding, mostly related to lower asset value. But aside from any significant appreciation and finished inventory values, we currently don't anticipate a significant reinvestment requirement for the full-year 2016. Even in the fourth quarter environment, our operating framework allowed us to generate meaningful cash from operations of $330 million. We currently estimate 2016 fixed asset capital investments to be between $250 million and $300 million, which includes the $100 million paint line addition at our Columbus Flat Roll Division, which is expected to begin operations the first quarter of 2017. We maintained our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders during the year, which increased by 20% in the first quarter. Our history of sustained and increasing cash dividends demonstrate the confidence that we and our board of directors have in the strength of our cash generation capability, our financial position and optimism concerning our future. As demonstrated throughout 2015 and the years prior, our business model generate strong cash flows in varying market cycles based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations and our diversified product portfolio. Even after decreasing debt in the first quarter and increasing our cash dividends to shareholders, we achieved record liquidity of $1.9 billion at the end of 2015. During the year, we reduced total debt $387 million to $2.6 billion. And due to our free cash flow performance, our net debt decreased $753 million to $1.9 billion. Our 2015 annual adjusted EBITDA was $706 million, resulting in net leverage at the end of the year of 2.7 times. Our credit profile continues to be aligned with our preferred through-cycle net leverage of less than 3 times, a testament to our disciplined approach to capital, growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook is incredibly flexible having no meaningful maturities until 2019. Looking forward, we believe our capital structure and credit profile have the flexibility to not only sustain current operations but to support additional strategic growth investments. Mark? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Thank you, Theresa. Well, safety and welfare of our employees is the priority for our leadership team, and nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains better than the industry average, but our goal remains zero safety incidents. The team has done a great job. Over half of our locations achieved zero recordable injuries in 2015. We reduced our total recordable injury rate by 19%, bringing it to the lowest level ever for our company. My sincere thanks to the entire SDI team for their focus and their dedication. The steel platform team's performed commendably, given the environment. In combination, the ongoing flood of steel imports, customer inventory destocking, and seasonally lower demand pressured steel product pricing, resulting in domestic industry production utilization rates below 65% in the quarter. Commodity-grade hot roll was most negatively impacted. CRU hot roll coil pricing fell almost $100 per ton from September to December, just over a 20% decline. Based on our value-added and diversified product mix, we were able to maintain production utilization for the fourth quarter above 73%. Worthy of note, our flat roll utilization rates bottomed in October and increased meaningfully in November and December. We believe this was a result of the progress achieved thus far from the levy trade cases, coupled with better alignment of supply chain inventory and demand. Despite a material decline in scrap pricing in the quarter, our metal spread contracted only slightly, as average product pricing declined more than our actualized average scrap costs. As production volumes fell, our scrap consumption obviously decreased, resulting in a higher average rifle- (13:26) based for the quarter as scrap flowed through the system. For the fourth quarter, we were probably closer to 1.5 to 2 months scrap cost lag versus our typical one-month lag. We will revert to our more normalized structure during the first quarter. This metal spread compression and lower shipments resulted in significantly lower earnings from our steel operations during the quarter, but progress is occurring across the platform despite these market challenges. The Columbus team is making tremendous progress towards diversifying its product mix and customer base away from energy-related markets and toward the automotive and construction sectors. They've added more than 100 new and valued customers in 2015. Market shifts take time, but our paint line and Galvalume addition on the Columbus campus will be a significant catalyst. I was at the groundbreaking yesterday and the energy, and expectations are high for the community and for our team. The $100 million investment will provide 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and further diversification into higher margin products for Columbus. We already have two paint lines in Galvalume capability in Indiana. And this project allows for higher quality, double-wide steel up to 72 inch wide and access to the southern markets including Mexico. We plan to sell surface-critical, appliance-grade steel as well as construction-related products from their line. We expect to have our first Columbus painted shipments in the first quarter 2017. In the interim, we continue to improve Columbus's operating costs, product portfolio and quality capabilities. During the fourth quarter, Columbus continued to maintain shipments of value-added galvanized steel at rates much higher than compared to earlier in the year. The value-add mix increased to 52% compared to 41% in the first quarter. We continue to see the benefit of collaboration between our Columbus and Butler flat-rolled steel mills. Along with production and process successes since the acquisition, Columbus is focused on implementing significant cost reduction initiatives with many more in the works. We have realized more than $15 million in sustainable annual cost savings through 2015 and identified plans for at least another $15 million in 2016. In addition, we anticipate continued benefit from the progressing product mix shift. Our steel platform also continues to benefit from other organic growth investments that we've made, some of which began contributing in 2015 but should continue to increase momentum in 2016. The $26 million investment in premium rail, the $96 million investment in engineered special bar quality diversification and capacity expansion generally geared toward the automotive industry. This diversification has already facilitated increased mill utilization and cost compression during this current weak heavy equipment and energy demand environment. Also, the $22 million investment for an additional 600,000 tons of annual flat roll pickling capacity in our Butler Division, which will increase value-added sales while deemphasizing commodity-grade hot band. The team began operating the line this month. The metals recycling platform maintained profitability through the three quarters of 2015, but the fourth quarter environment was too caustic, resulting in an operating loss of $16 million prior to the impairment. From September to December, Ferrous Scrap Index price fell another $65 to $75 per ton, about 30%, as weaker demand also drove shipments down 12%. Prime scrap flow remains strong, but lower pricing significantly slowed the flow of obsolete grades. Market dynamics overshadowed the cost reductions and operating efficiencies the team achieved through the year. The recycling environment remains challenging. Many regional players in the industry are either for sale or headed to bankruptcy. The continued significant overcapacity of shredders, particularly in the South (17:40) Eastern United States, continues to constrain margin, as processes are all competing for the same material, a tough challenge for our OmniSource Southeast team. Looking forward, with the expectation of a continued strong U.S. dollar and low scrap export volumes, we anticipate ample scrap supply and don't see drivers for any significant increase in ferrous scrap prices through the year. Market will remain stable. The fabrication platform continues to achieve exceptional performance. Steady demand in an otherwise seasonally slower quarter, combined with increased market share from our recent acquisition of additional deck assets, allowed us to increase fourth quarter shipments by 10%. The fabrication platform recorded strong fourth quarter financial results and achieved record annual 2015 operating income of $116 million, well over twice last year's record of $52 million. As Theresa said, the team is executing on all fronts and doing a absolutely phenomenal job. Since the CSi acquisition, we've already gained market share in deck, achieving 31% in the fourth quarter of the year compared to an average 24% in 2014. Additionally, the acquisition provides an opportunity for increased utilization at the Columbus Flat Roll Division. Over the last three years, the acquired assets averaged over 60,000 tons of annual steel purchases, predominantly galvanized. We plan to source a substantial amount of the steel from Columbus, which will help shift Columbus's product mix and increase their mill utilization. The New Millennium team continues to perform exceedingly well, both in market share gain and leveraging our national footprint. And additionally, I think the strength of this business provides positive insight and for the continued growth of non-residential construction activity. Relative to the macroenvironment, the steel-consuming sectors that were weak in 2015 will likely remain so in 2016, such as energy, heavy equipment and agriculture. However, those that have been strong or recovering are also expected to continue this path, such as automotive and construction. Forecasts for these two largest domestic steel-consuming sectors remain good. Automotive will have continued strength and overall construction spending should continue to improve with additional forecasted growth in 2016. SDI has grown exposure to both of these sectors through our Columbus Flat Roll Division, additional long products production capability and growing fabrication operations. Driven by the strong U.S. dollar, low iron ore cost and global overcapacity, steel imports were 2015's principal headwind. Excessive steel import volume combined with high customer inventory levels limited U.S. steel mill utilization and pressured domestic steel pricing. While SDI's production utilization remains well above our peers and the industry, there's certainly more to be achieved. And we believe the fundamentals are supportive of a continued positive trend in economic growth and for us in the U.S. Additionally, import levels declined in the second half of the year and the trade cases are likely to erode them further. Reduced imports, idling of domestic capacity along with steady demand should create a positive pricing and volume environment that could allow room for some price appreciation in 2016. As raw material prices remain at lower levels and production utilization improves, there's margin expansion opportunity. Importantly, as we typically do, we're not waiting. In order to help insulate ourselves from imports, part of our strategy is to not only develop strong customer relationships but to also manufacture products that are more difficult to compete on a global basis, such as our painted flat-rolled steel, our highly engineered SBQ steel and longer length rail. As such, we are able to mitigate some of the import impact and, with our broad portfolio of value-added products, maintain higher steel mill utilization rates when compared to our peers. Driven to maintain a sustainable, differentiated business, we're focusing on opportunities to maximize our financial performance. In these challenging times, our low, highly variable cost structure, coupled with a highly diversified value-added product portfolio, will continue to generate significant cash flow. This was clearly demonstrated by a cash generation of over $1 billion in 2015. We're uniquely positioned, having a strong capital structure with record liquidity that will allow growth as opportunities will inevitably arise this year. We will concentrate on opportunities that will improve the quality of our margins, with a particular focus on downstream value-added growth to mitigate the impact of imports and the inevitable cyclicality of our business. The strong character and determination of our employees are unmatched. They're a phenomenal group and I'm proud to stand with them. We look forward to creating new opportunities for them, for our customers and our shareholders in the months and years ahead. So, again, thank you for your time today. Thanks for joining us. And Kevin, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Tony Rizzuto from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Happy New Year, Mark, Theresa, Dick, Russ, everybody. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Happy New Year, Tony (23:40). Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. Thank you. I've got a little bit of a cold here. I apologize. Just a couple questions. First of all, in your steel segment, shipments were down sequentially, but it looks like your conversion costs were up somewhat. I wonder if you can provide a little bit of color on that. And then I've got some questions about mix shift, too, that I wanted to ask you. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Regarding the conversion costs, Tony, they were up somewhat across, really, most of the divisions, and that had to do with a couple different things. One was because of the lower volume. There was some additional, I think, maintenance that might have taken place in the fourth quarter as well. But predominantly, it was related to the lower utilization rates. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : (24:30), did you have some... Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's okay. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right. Great. And then, Mark, you mentioned that you added over 100 \u2013 I think I heard you say over 100 new customers in 2015, so congrats on that. And I was wondering, how many of those customers were because of the Columbus acquisition? And are you guys generally seeing OEMs come to you and approach you about significantly changing qualification requirements? They're trying to shorten them up and trying to get more of your product in their doors? How is that playing out? If you could provide some further color there, that would be helpful. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the additional 100 customers, and I was down there yesterday, is actually 120 customers right now, is specifically Columbus, not the company as a whole. I think the team has done an absolute phenomenal job, not only on the cost structure, and I'm sure at some point Chris will speak to that, but the product diversification there has been incredible in a very short period of time. As I've said, we've seen a dramatic increase in value-added product mix there from earlier in the year. Automotive, the automotive team has made, in all honesty, incredible progress on a couple of different fronts. Firstly, as you know, we created our own team to go direct to automotive customers, and that's paying off very, very well. And we're hoping to see about 200,000 tons or so \u2013 150,000 to 200,000 tons of auto business emanate from that activity in 2016, and if we're successful, and we will be successful there, that's going to grow dramatically into 2017. So, kudos to the team there. And one area that has helped us there and actually across our platform, also in Engineered Bar, is our financial strength. Obviously, the consumers are getting a little concerned about some of our peers maybe. And they, particularly the Europeans, want to partner with people that are going to be here for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, and we're seeing a lot of activity based on that. They like our team. They like that we're innovative and we're rapid, and we can develop things very quickly. And they like the fact that, again, we're going to do more than survive. We're going to grow greater value for them going forward. The Columbus team also is moving to lighter gauge high-strength low-alloy type steels and also X70 and X80 type grades. So, they're expanding their product mix. We've also had great fortune with our existing customer base in our new process, in particular, that they've got a facility on site. And I think, Chris, that activity has increased from to 25,000 (27:39) to 30,000 tons in prior years to about 120,000 tons in 2015. So, our partnering relationships and our consistency of commercial approach, I think, is paying huge dividends down there. And then the paint line and the Galvalume expansion is only going to accentuate that, it brings 250,000 tons or so of construction-type painted products, HVAC, appliance grades, surface-critical materials. So, the team is doing an absolutely phenomenal job there from my perspective. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Congrats on the progress there. And just you piqued my interest, you made a comment during your remarks about opportunities as they might open up this year because of the financial stress you alluded to and your comments about how some of your customers are getting increasingly concerned. In addition to bolt-ons and maybe looking further downstream, would you be averse to looking if there are some opportunities that could open up, say, in the upstream area, in the mill side? Or should we think about opportunities in addition to organic, the more acquisitive opportunities continue to be more bolt-on type? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, obviously, the environment is somewhat challenging for some of our peers. And the team, as you heard, did an absolute phenomenal job last year in performing in a tough environment. I think generating over $1 billion of cash just demonstrates the strength of our business model and the phenomenal job our guys and girls did. It put us into a phenomenal position. We've got record liquidity. We've got a lot of cash. We're healthy and in a position to grow. And we still have, if needed, access to capital markets because of all that, whereas many of our \u2013 some of our peers perhaps will struggle there. From an allocation perspective, because I think, Tony, that's kind of where you're headed there, we have said in the past and would like to continue a positive profile on our dividend. We have focused internally and looking at organic opportunities and there's some incredibly positive value creation, very efficient, effective use of CapEx through some organic growth projects. We have somewhere around 400,000 tons, maybe 500,000 tons of excess hot metal capacity at Columbia City, our Structural and Rail Division that we can leverage. The team has been working on the imbalance in hot metal and downstream production at Roanoke, so there's some upside there. And Steel West Virginia has a somewhat old melt (30:53) caster environment which we can, I think, improve on in some way, shape or form going forward. And then there are obviously just the innovative tweakings that our guys seem to continually come up with. We got a smaller hot-rolled galv line expansion potential uplift. It's just a myriad of smaller projects that the guys just continue to come up with to create value and diversify our product mix even more. On the acquisitional side, again, the industry's in stress. Our main focus is in improving the quality of our margin, the profitability of our business, and I think that speaks more downstream than sort of back-stream. So, value add, downstream processing, things that mitigate our \u2013 the cyclicality of our business, things that will mitigate perhaps the import \u2013 situational import pressure that will be with us forever at some level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matthew Korn from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Matt. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Matt. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So on the steel operation side, we've seen industry capacity utilization numbers up from the December trough, but they're still low. I'm curious, now that we're about quarter to the quarter, is the velocity of orders that you're getting from buyers meaningfully improved? Have the buyers kind of pulled out of their deflationary expectations that had set in for so long? And overall, is the seasonality of demand, maybe even ex energy, is that following the normal track, in your view, or are things still fairly fragile? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think there's positive momentum, generally. I'm sure Dick can speak to some of it, but the inventory overhang, there's continued destocking there and it's becoming imbalanced. It's still relatively high, particularly in hot band. But in coated products, in coated (33:10) sheet, I think it's getting into a good position. And you speak to a seasonal uptick. I think we're seeing that as well. But the \u2013 we suffered in, I think it was October and November was where we took a real hit to volumes, and we were just talking this morning. In the last two weeks \u2013 Chris, the last two weeks of December, Columbus took 330,000 tons... Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: (33:39) Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Of orders. Quite a flip. For some time the customer base has been concerned as to where raw material pricing might go. There's \u2013 consumer confidence out there, just from the global sort of geopolitical environment is a cloud. Once they saw stability in raw materials, I think they came back to market. So, our lead times have been stretching out. They are weakest in hot band. And again, there's still a lot of inventory out there. But lead time I think in Butler and Columbus is in the two weeks to probably stretching to three weeks. Still, we keep it no longer than four weeks in any event. But of all the products, hot band is probably the softest. On cold roll sheet and coated, I sense a tightness forming in that arena. I think it's a combination of \u2013 the automotive arena is strong. So, the integrated mills got a relatively good order book. Construction continues to come back. There's some destocking going on. And we have some relief from the trade cases and erosion of import levels. So, that's timing, and we're about five weeks at Columbus. We're over six weeks at Butler. And at Techs, we're about six weeks to seven weeks out. So, that arena, I think, is \u2013 again, I sense a tightness growing there and that obviously gives the ability for some further price appreciation. You may see a strange \u2013 I saw it in the American Metal Market this morning, but we are seeing two slight diversions of the typical spread between hot band and other products. I think hot band, near term, will be kind of flattish, whereas as I said, corro sheet and coated are likely to appreciate. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. That's actually very helpful. Let me switch over quickly to fabrication and tell me if this isn't the right way to think about it. But could you describe what would be your order backlog today relative to your current staffing levels, maybe compared to where you were a year ago? In other words, do you have 8 weeks, 10 weeks of work pending, 12 weeks, 4 weeks \u2013 again, if that's a reasonable way of comparison? And then you've mentioned that you still expect non-residential growth, construction growth for 2016. On terms of a rate, do you think that we're going to pick up from last year? Are things softening from last year? Have you seen any kind of new activity spurred on by the lower prevailing prices at all, anything like that? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: When you're comparing backlog from early in the year to the end of the year, one has to be a little careful because the productivity of the teams up there have done \u2013 the improvement in productivity has just been phenomenal. Chris, do you want to speak to the backlog? Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: I'd say, year-over-year, we have seen a change. We're going into \u2013 or we're in the middle of a quarter with a stronger backlog in this quarter than we had at this time last year. As far as our capacity, we did not have to add too much capacity in 2015, which is kind of remarkable given our results. That's more leveraging our existing capacity to a greater extent, occasionally working some overtime. We have a lot of flexibility in that regard. So, with about the same staffing, we were probably at \u2013 all of our backlog is about 12 weeks. And our backlog is always about 12 weeks out, it just depends on how large that backlog is, because that's a typical life cycle of a project for us. But we were soft last first quarter. First quarter, I think, was our lowest volume. This year, it's up substantially, Mark, everybody is running full. We've seen no seasonal downtime yet. That's always in the offing in February and March, depending on weather. But right now, things are steady. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Super. And I know we spoke about it already, but just to emphasize, the CSi acquisition, relatively small for us, perhaps, but very good value, and it's already paying great dividends. The deck share increased from beginning of the year at 24% to 31% at the end of the year, I think, is testament to the decision that the team made there. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Chris, Mark. Best of luck for the rest of the quarter. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Hi, guys. I just got a couple. Maybe for Theresa, on the balance sheet. So following a good year where you had some wins on the working capital side, can you dig into some more details around the opportunities perhaps on the accounts receivable and the inventory throughout 2016, and how we should think about the free cash flow and working capital positions towards the end of the year? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly. As we look at 2016, from a working capital perspective, the premise for us is that we think raw materials, specifically scrap, are going to stay pretty flat throughout the year on an annual basis. And with that, we really do try to manage our inventories to less than four weeks on hand at our steel mills. So we don't expect a big working capital funding requirement on the raw material side of the equation. So then you're really looking at finish goods and accounts receivable. From a finish goods perspective, we also traditionally produce to ship. There's only certain inventories that we keep at our bar mills and our structural mills. And so with that, if there's any significant appreciation in price or value, there'll be some funding requirements, but otherwise, we don't see that changing materially either. And from a receivable standpoint, we're pretty comfortable with our DSOs. There's always room for improvement, but the expectation right now is that working capital in 2016 shouldn't require, on an annual basis, a great deal of additional investment. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks very much. And then Mark, you touched on it in that last answer, but what would you expect then throughout the year on that gap between HRC and the CRC, without giving too much detail, but I think we're at about $140 to $160 per short ton at the moment as opposed to a normal $100 to $120 margin. Do you think it can blow out beyond that or do you think that's a sort of quantum that we should expect throughout the year? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think it will expand beyond the range today for sure. Dick, what do you think? Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : I think there'll be pressure on it. I think there's always boundaries, but I think under this current environment, you're right. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Evan Kurtz from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, guys. Hope you had a nice holiday. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Wonderful. Thank you. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just maybe one on the FIFO. You mentioned that you had one and a half to two months of lag on your scrap costs in the fourth quarter when everything was coming down. Any way to quantify exactly how much that actually hurt in the fourth quarter, either in dollar per ton basis or just kind of overall? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I haven't personally quantified it. But I guess off the top of the head, no. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. That would be very difficult for us to quantify right at this time. So we'll just pass on that question. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So I have another one. How about strategic options at the metals recycling business? I mean, it's \u2013 I know it was a very difficult quarter in the fourth quarter with prices falling so quickly. But is there anything you can do there as far as trimming some operations to maybe boost profitability in that business? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Russ can chip in with some detail, but the softness in the fourth quarter, obviously driven by reduced ferrous margins, not just ferrous margins, but non-ferrous as well. But if you just look at the year, it's a tough environment when you have a progressively down-trending commodity market in every segment : copper, nickel, aluminum and ferrous. When you start the year, I don't know, $380 a ton or so, and you end the year at $160-$180. The recycling business, historically, has earnings capability in volatility, not just a consumer downward trend. So, that certainly impacted the year as a whole and the fourth quarter. And I would suggest -we already mentioned that the market is somewhat stable going forward through 2016. That unto itself should give that team some help, but Russ? Russell B. Rinn - President and Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Evan, thank you for the question. Again, I think in more specific details, in 2015, we continues to try to mold our business around what markets are available. So, in 2015, during that prolonged downturn in market prices, we did idle or shut down, I think, 19 plants, locations across the platform. We also idled a couple of shredders to try to balance out the flow and the demand that comes through. Again in scrap business, we're flowing material through on a constant basis. And so as Mark talked about, that constant downturn does not give us a chance to pause or catch back up. So we're always trying to catch that falling knife. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And maybe on that, what's your kind of near-term outlook for scrap? Russell B. Rinn - President and Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think \u2013 again, I think as Mark and Theresa both stated, Evan, I think we're seeing flat \u2013 in pretty range bound -- in a pretty flat environment for the year, again, after a more than 50% price decrease in 2015, we think we've kind of found a bottom point. Again, there will be some volatility, but we don't expect gross ups or gross downs. So, again, our view is that it is a pretty flattish environment for 2016. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It is related to the commentary regarding moving up the value chain, et cetera. I know traditionally, historically, Steel Dynamics has been more \u2013 has operated more in the \u2013 sort of in the spot end of the business, spot as compared to contract. Can you remind us your current mix between spot and contract, number one? Number two, how that may change in 2016? And number three, of the contract business, how much actually reprices on a calendar year basis? Thanks. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, when we talk of contract business, those are not fixed price contracts. They are index \u2013 they're volume contracts against the index. So, as the product pricing sort of ebbs and flows, the pricing changes with it, but we're not locked into fixed pricing all year. I wouldn't say none, there's a few tons, but absolutely (46:42) meaningful in the scheme of things. Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : And even those contracts, we don't have lots of those. Many of them we work with scrap buybacks and we have many types of arrangements. And so I would tell you we have a host of them. So, we've had to adapt ourselves. You ask how will we be changing in 2016. As we move up the value chain, as you pointed out, dealing with automotive, dealing with off-road heavy equipment and so forth, they have different expectations. We've tried to modify those expectations to fall more in line with our comfort levels. Some have been more willing than others to adapt towards our direction. Some have been surprisingly pleased with the results of some changes in our direction, and some we just can't get there with. But I think overall, there's always two parties that are satisfied, and we don't have long-term fixed contracts at all. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So, generally speaking, should we expect a meaningful shift in volume tied to \u2013 whether \u2013 obviously, there's pass-throughs for scrap, but volumes tied to either a fixed margin or price in 2016 versus 2015, or very consistent versus 2015, you would say? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I would say that generally, it'd be consistent. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're pretty happy with the balance between those volume commitments versus the spot market. And to emphasize Dick's point, because I think it's a critical point, because it's a changing paradigm maybe. But this past year, when automotive pricing, we don't know for sure, but automotive pricing probably on a fixed basis was in the $600-ish (48:50) range. When we see our perspective customers in that arena, see the positive impact of a CR-based index, and with us, they saved in the spot world considerable money. I think you're going to see that paradigm actually change for the auto industry, personally. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Just remind us again, on the $100 million investment in Columbus on the paint line, as we get out to 2017, what's the combination of volume and a rough rule of thumb on a sort of a margin expansion expectation for that investment? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, the volume is \u2013 the paint line has the capability of doing 250,000 tons annually. And then, we also have the capability of Galvalume as well, which could start a little bit earlier than the paint line. But the paint line's expected to start in the first quarter of 2017. Traditionally, we sometimes talk in payback periods, and the idea around the paint line is that much like a lot of our other projects, that payback period is around a 24-type month payback period... Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : Two years to three years. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...two to three years. So, we're very comfortable there. And if you look at our product portfolio across the company, painted flat roll is really our highest margin or very close to our highest margin product across the entire company landscape. So, it should be meaningful for Columbus. Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: And as we grab that last 300,000 or 400,000 tons of capacity at the current design, we think allows for \u2013 that will just be some vanilla hot band that won't be sold. But 250,000 tons will be sold as painted, that would otherwise maybe be sold as a vanilla plain hot band. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Happy 2016. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Timna. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I wanted to follow up on the automotive discussion. I thought it was a really interesting point about the concern over the financial strength of some of your competitors. But I hadn't heard you talk as much about automotive in the past, so can you remind us like what applications you're targeting? I know Columbus at one point was looking at exterior automotives before you bought them. Is that still on your target? And how big, either on a percent or absolute value, could auto become over the next several years for Steel Dynamics? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we have always been a reasonably large player in automotive. Obviously not anything close to the integrated mills, but relative to our electric-arc furnace-based peers. Butler, for instance, is around about 30%, 32% of its product mix has been for a long time going into automotive. Supply chain, different there, where we've used processes to be the conduit into that business, whereas, we are \u2013 we're going to retain and keep those relationships. At the same time, the automotive consumers have a mill direct buy or business, which is substantial. And so we're targeting that mill directly through our automotive team of eight folks that we brought on. Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : (52:42) Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And as I said, they've been doing a phenomenal job. The addition of Columbus gives us some better product capabilities. Obviously, the width, 72-inch wide helps. And it also allows us to get into some of the \u2013 not all, but some of the high-strength low-alloy-type products for automotive. We are not targeting exposed. There's plenty of steel on a car, on a vehicle, on a truck that doesn't need the super surface-critical qualities that maybe an integrated producer can provide. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And if you had a percent or any more quantification, that would be great. I wanted to change gears to the trade cases, because you are the first of the mills in the U.S. to host your conference call. And the numbers that came out, at least in the preliminary results, so far, have been \u2013 aside from Chinese galvanized, have been kind of small in terms of the damages awarded? So, I just wanted to get your sense, you did say in your prepared remarks that the trade cases should help keep imports lower than they have been. But in light of what we've seen so far, what gives you that conviction or what do you expect to see happen? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Just one follow-up from your original question, Timna. The aim for automotive coming out of Columbus, we'd like to grow that business to about 400,000 to 500,000 tons a year. Dick, do you want to talk the trade? Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : Sure. I'll just make some real quick observations that \u2013 from a timing perspective, we have preliminary rulings on the corrosion-resistant on both the antidumping and countervailing, and that the final determinations, we asked them to be aligned as an industry. And those would come out middle of May. The ITC will likely rule on final injury in July. Just why would the industry ask for the alignment of the two to determine final determinations by the DOC? That would be because we think that not all the information was taken into account, we believe that like the findings in Taiwan on Galvalume and so forth weren't necessarily correct, and to give the Department of Commerce more time to review the information that was submitted to fairly evaluate it and possibly revise the information upon review, and so therefore we believe there's a better value coming there. I think the most important thing on both the CVDs and the AD that we could say, to date, is that when you look at the percentages, huge percentages on the Chinese, 255% on the AD and 235% on six firms on the CVDs. 28% to 34% of the total imports of coated products came from China, and the lowest pricing was driven by the Chinese products. And so by taking out really a non-market-driven competitor, I think it's a tremendous advantage to the rest of the market and to all of us in the domestic field. The others, you have India at 12% \u2013 and again, the Chinese, that was a million tons of coated products. And if you take a million tons out of that coated products market, that's just \u2013 1 million tons, that's a jump ball for others. Again, not all are going to get captured by the domestic market, but it's available to other suppliers. India, 12%, 400,000 tons, 400,000 \u2013 and these are metric tons. So it's even bigger as we talk available to us. Again, 7%, 5%, the most, again just on CVs, you get another 6% to 7% on ADs. Again, they're driven by profit. So you add those together, that's 13%, 14% on top of \u2013 that comes out of their profit. And so, they have to be driven by a question, am I here to make a profit or not. And if they're not here just for creating employment in their home state, then they will have to make hard choices, do they really want to participate in this market versus growing somewhere else. I mean I could go through all of these, I don't know we want to take the time. But you got cold-rolled that's going to have a preliminary AD coming in February. You got hot-rolled, the preliminary AD in March. And we've asked for alignment on all of those final determinations again to give the Department of Commerce plenty of time. So those will be coming; cold-rolled in July 15 and hot-rolled in July 29, and the ITC will rule in August and September on those respectively. So, again, you take out the bad apples in each case. Whenever anyone is really looking to make a profit here, I tell you that 6% or 7% on either countervailing or dumping and you add those together, you get 10%, 15%, 20%. That's a real disincentive to be in this market. And these are big tons, so it provides our sales people an opportunity to get out and get moving in the catch room (58:53). Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And if you look at the \u2013 just the market generally, imports early in the year, around about 34% of our domestic consumption. Yeah, that eroded to about 30% in the fourth quarter, with a lot more activity to be determined here in this month, next month. So, we strongly predict that imports will continue to erode. Will they get back down to 21% or 23% in the near term? Probably not. But again, you knock 1 million tons here and 1 million tons there out of the marketplace, that is meaningful. And yes, there's the old Whack-A-Mole game, you totally shut China out, but maybe Vietnam is growing a little bit here and there, and you're getting some tons substituted elsewhere. But to Dick's point, you have counter [countervailing] duty and antidumping, you may think 15% relative to 200% against China is small, but these products are selling \u2013 they're not hot band products, they're coated and painted, so they're selling at $600 to $700 a ton, 10% to 15%, that's $90 to $100 impact. And as we talked to our larger \u2013 I won't name names \u2013 but several of our very large processing customers out there, they also anecdotally indicate to us that these are meaningful duties and will erode the import number. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for that perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Phil. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I had a question on just the SBQ business, and I know there are some out there that price that business on an annual basis with annual, call it, contract prices. Any sense to \u2013 any sense you could provide us as to how much of that business may be more on an annual contract reset? Because I know you typically are commercially a bit more nimble than maybe some others. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, Phil, from that perspective, you're right, we're much more spot-focused. So what you would consider a truly annual reset on base pricing, aside from obviously we have the alloy and the scrap surcharges and whatnot, we would say that maybe about 25% to 30% of our volume, and that did price down somewhat heading into 2016, but we still have a lot of opportunity on the spot side of the equation and just on volume in total. And that kind of 25% \u2013 20% to 25% is based on 2015 volumes not on capacity, which obviously capacity is a lot higher than that at 950,000 tons. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. I appreciate that. And then second, just real quickly for Dick. The downstream products like cold-rolled and galv have made their way incrementally higher relative to hot-rolled, I know, Mark, you had talked a little bit about that earlier in the call, but is there more \u2013 does that invite more import on that side if that gets too far out of whack relative to hot-rolled? Thanks. Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : It always has the opportunity if it gets out of alignment. And so I would tell you that I think right now, there's an opportunity for, as we said earlier, some more expansion, but it can't go stupid. So we're \u2013 everyone's very conscious of it and I think our sales people are working very hard in trying to find where that fine line is. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael will (1:03:14) Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Aldo Mazzaferro from Macquarie. Please proceed with your question. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen and Theresa. Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : Morning (1:03:25) Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Aldo. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Tricia. (1:03:26) Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. And sorry, Tricia (1:03:29). And I like the business philosophy, don't do anything stupid. Okay. In terms of the scrap business, can I just ask, the numbers were actually better than I expected given the major drop. And I'm wondering, you must've at least kept pace with the decline in pricing on your input cost. Would you say that's fair or do you think you trailed it somehow? Russell B. Rinn - President and Chief Operating Officer : Aldo, I would tell you, you can't keep complete pace with it, that's the problem with a falling market. What you think you're getting ahead today, you get slammed at the next market turn. We kept fair pace with it but it was virtually impossible last year to try to get out in front of it and try to make a headway on it. So I think us and the entire industry, I'm sure you've seen the entire industry is struggling, as Mark talked about earlier. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes. So if you go \u2013 if you take this forward a couple \u2013 like a quarter or two and you see a sideways pattern and you probably gain back some of that stuff you missed on the spread, right, going forward next couple of quarters? Russell B. Rinn - President and Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think we've got an opportunity. We've got an opportunity \u2013 as Mark said earlier, in a volatile market, one that moves up and down, provides best opportunity for the guys in the scrap business. But after last year, I'll take a flat market all day long. Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: So, Russ, does this opportunity \u2013 Mark mentioned how the regional competitors are either for sale or are on the way to bankruptcy, do you see this as an opportunity to increase your stake at all in the scrap business, or do you think the opposite, or not all? Russell B. Rinn - President and Chief Operating Officer : No, I'll \u2013 I would say our teams are very busy in trying to secure business where those opportunities arise. Again, I think just like Mark alluded to or talked to about earlier the strong financial condition of our company, certainly, that bears in mind when you've got people who are generating scrap that want to get paid. And so we certainly use that leverage to try to help get the right kind of business for us for the long term. And our teams have done a great job. They've been very active in trying to do what's right for us in the long term. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I think the emphasis there would be the focus on secure business, not necessarily assets. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The industry obviously is going through incredible financial stress. If you read \u2013 if one reads the American Metal Market, literally, every single morning, there are two or three scrap yards, scrap organizations either idling, going bankrupt, selling. I mean, it's a stressed, stressed, stressed industry. You might see us on a very small basis, on a very regional basis, pick up a small asset here and there, but I'm talking small, small dollars, not huge. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: (1:06:40) I'm sorry. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And you may see us also \u2013 and you may also see us strengthen our abilities around the Columbus mill to provide some security there. But we're not in a big -- let's roll the scrap industries up and consolidate. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Could I ask one more question? In terms of your \u2013 if you look across your assets, across all the company assets, can you say which mills might be underutilized today because of the fact that they're ramping up new equipment and bringing that equipment to full utilization, compared to how many mills would you say are underutilized because of demand reasons at this point? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're talking about SDI mills now? Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, across SDI. I'm thinking you've obviously got the engineered bars that are coming up, you probably have some rail coming up. I'm wondering how much of your capacity utilization might reflect the fact that you've invested in new capacity and then bringing that on to the market as opposed to just plain and simple demand weakness? Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : I'll take a stab at that and then Mark can clean up where I might have missed, but I'll start from the East and work my way west and south. But Roanoke is not running full because of market. We run short both on \u2013 we have excess both melt and excess \u2013 we used to have more billet sales as well as merchant sales, but because of the imports, we are lacking a little bit of both. So that's the market. Steel in West Virginia actually runs very full on both of their mills. As Mark alluded, we're actually melt short and so they do get billets from Roanoke, and so they're not lacking anything from an output perspective from the mills, so they're running full. The Techs could use some more business, but as we see a strengthening in the galvanized, and we're product \u2013 we're diversifying the product there, so forth, and we have Galfan product that will \u2013 had record tons last year, we're going to look for bigger tons this year, that's a matter of market acceptance. And we're also expanding our capabilities. We're looking at maybe making some improvements at MetalTech which has been sometimes the weakest. And so therefore, we're looking at making a little bit of more capacity there. I come here, Butler, as Mark mentioned, we just started pickling on our push-pull pickle line last week. And if we had that running stronger, we would be pulling more hot band tons through there because we have \u2013 we're backlogged amazingly in front of the pickle line. And so, we have more capacity running through. And as Mark alluded, then we have some other projects in tow that will put more value-added product through Butler, now that we have the pickling capacity in-house, and so that's \u2013 Butler stands to improve. Columbia City has the capacity to do more tons, the No. 1 mill, the heavy-section mill and rail mill runs full. I think right now, railroads are \u2013 Class 1 railroads are cutting back somewhat on their capital projects. I think some of that's energy-related, so forth. They're still pulling, I think, their maintenance is fine but I think their capital is a little bit weaker. But we'll see non-residential, I think, continue to improve. So, the No. 1 mill, the heavy-section mill is full. The No. 2 mill, the medium-section mill, struggles to ever \u2013 we haven't filled it up ever. We have two to three crews there. The third crew bounces back and forth between rolling the mill and going out to rail welding, now wherever they're most efficiently utilized. So, that's some capacity that's yet to be used. And Mark has also mentioned that we have more melting and capacity there, they do send some blues (1:11:11) to Steel West Virginia based on whatever Steel West Virginia needs are. Dropping down to Pittsboro, as a market, that has been weakened by \u2013 even automotive is strong, we all know agriculture, off-road, you name it, forgers, there's a lot of opportunity to improve that. We made a great investment in our smaller section, the 14-inch mill as we call it, has kept that utilization up, making small bars, precision bars, great acceptance in the marketplace. And if market recovers, we're prepared for it. We don't run our melt shop there during the day Monday through Fridays due to higher power costs. We make up for it on off-peak and weekends and so forth. And we really are -- stand ready to pound that if we want to and when the market recovers. And then you have now Columbus, and you've heard enough about that... Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Right. Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : That we're growing that market through customers. So, that's the utilization and we're \u2013 we stand ready to fill up wherever we can, and very little of it's equipment. Just probably, as I mentioned, we really only have Butler as the one that \u2013 and that's not anyone's fault; we just started last week. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, in aggregate, Aldo, we \u2013 the steel team has done a phenomenal job growing its capabilities, I would tell you, over the last five years since 2008. And we still have more than 2 million tons of what I call peak capacity that -- we've never had a steel-consuming environment in which to totally exploit that. So, our capabilities today are so much ahead of our prior peak, it's untrue. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Well, thanks so much. It's an excellent rundown. Thank you very much. Richard P. Teets - Director, President & COO- Steel Operations : Take care, Aldo. Operator : Okay. Your next question today is coming from Justine Fisher from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. I know it's been a long call, so I just have one question for Theresa. As far as the potential acquisition opportunities that you guys are looking at, are most of the opportunities that you're seeing in a range that could be financed with cash or are more of the opportunities big enough such that they would require coming to the capital markets? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, first of all, we're in a unique position that the capital markets are a bit messy right now, but we believe that we're one of the few that still have access, which is important and a good thing, so we see that just improving throughout the rest of the year. But I think that we're looking at all ranges of potential growth. and so with that, were we to need to access capital markets, we believe we have the ability to do so. If not, the cash generation you've seen is pretty significant. With over $700 million of cash on the balance sheet, we've got quite a capacity just with that in and of itself. But for meaningful long-term investments, we like to use the capital markets, as appropriate, to invest long term. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So it could be something in the kind of high hundred millions, billion dollar range there? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think everything's on the table. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: Theresa, while we had a question on \u2013 sorry. Operator : No. Please proceed. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: I'm sorry. This is Chris. I just wanted to report on our Columbus acquisition. We owed some answers or some information to the team. Just an update. When we contemplated the Columbus Division, we had about \u2013 identified about $30 million in what you might call non-operating cost savings opportunities that might have been power renegotiations, headcounts, things like that. We identified about $15 million in 2015 which we capitalized on. About another $15 million or so in 2016 is on the horizon. Those kind of pale in \u2013 we have a unique incentive program for our folks that stresses not only quality production, but also cost of conversion. And the savings in 2015 that we realized in conversion costs are multiples of the numbers we talked about in non-operational. More non-operational opportunities in 2016. We're nowhere near Butler's cost structure in some departments. So another big opportunity for multiples of that number in 2016. So I just wanted to report that the plan's coming through and the Columbus folks are executing well. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I guess what you're saying is that $30 million in total synergies pales in comparison to the opportunity in conversion cost and market share shift. Chris Graham - President of New Millennium and Vice President of Steel Dynamics, Steel Dynamics, Inc.: That would have made for a shorter call. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thank you. All right. Kevin, we can go with the next question. Operator : Certainly. Our next question today is coming from the line of Garrett Nelson from BB&T Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets : Hi, everyone. Great quarter from a free cash flow perspective. Could you talk a little bit more about some of the uses of cash we should expect in 2016 in addition to the CapEx increase from the paint line project and the potential acquisition opportunities that you talked about in the past? It looks like you've typically raised your quarterly dividend in the second quarter. Is this something we should expect again this year? And is debt paydown a priority or are you comfortable with your current leverage ratios, given the strong cash flow and record-high liquidity? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think from a net leverage basis, we're about 2.7 times, so that's under our, say, hurdle of three to 4 (1:17:13) relatively comfortable there. That's not to say we wouldn't take advantage going forward. From a dividend perspective, we have \u2013 or you've seen a, what we call, a positive profile but an improvement or an increase sort of year-over-year. Last year was a big step-up, 20% or so, and that was really a reflection of the acquisition of Columbus and the step-up in natural cash flow from that asset. So, I would not suggest that when we say a positive profile, you're going to see 20% every year. But I would suggest that the positive profile will hopefully remain intact going forward. We've got substantial cash flow generation as you saw last year, and our business model will continue to provide the ability for that dividend payment. Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah. I just had a question on capital allocation, Theresa, approaching $800 million in cash right now. Your debt maturities are pretty well laddered, CapEx under control. Any thoughts on what the hierarchy of capital allocation is at this point, and how we should be thinking about deployment? Thanks. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think from the team's perspective, and Mark can kick me under the table if he disagrees, but growth, we believe, is still going to drive the greatest value to the shareholder, and so, especially in this environment when things are pretty weak for our peers, to wait and watch to see what assets might become available. And then also on the organic side, we mentioned several projects where we have extra melting capacity that we want to utilize. So that tends to be very capital efficient. So I think that's our primary focus. And then obviously, we have the positive dividend profile. We have additional, potential debt reduction which you're right, the maturity ladder is really flexible for us from the long-term great rate perspective. But we evaluate all different aspects of returning value to shareholders. But I would say that's the hierarchy. Mark, do you agree? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Totally. We continually assess options. I would tell you that the current environment is certainly unique, I think, in most of our short lifespan as an industry. But it's going to be an interesting year, interesting 18 months. And I think it's a case of a good time to keep one's gunpowder dry. Be patient, because I think there's going to be \u2013 there are already tremendous opportunities \u2013 tremendous, I take that back. There are already a myriad of opportunities coming to market. And I think the focus needs to be being prudent and patient, and waiting for those opportunities that will really, really improve our margin profile and not just take the first thing that comes down the road, so to speak. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: That's truly helpful. I appreciate it. And the last one, and I'll take off. If you had to guess right now, Mark, would you expect your steel utilizations to be better in the first quarter than the fourth quarter? Thanks. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Utilization, yes. I think the \u2013 for the first quarter, volumes will be improved. I think margins will \u2013 one needs to realize that there's going to be a carry-through pricing. We do have index pricing. So the contract pricing will carry through into January through December, so that's going to mute things a little bit. But no, volumes, utilization definitely will improve. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Millet for any closing remarks. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Super. Well, for those on the line, we certainly appreciate your support. And we continue to say that we are incredibly and uniquely positioned in our industry. Our business model has paid off. We have and will continue to generate a strong cash flow in these difficult times. We have, as I said earlier, a couple million tons of latent capacity to exploit over the year. We have inorganic opportunities. We have certainly organic opportunities to improve. Columbus continues to do a phenomenal job, we expect great things there. And as we've discussed, I think there are going to be opportunities available for sort of acquisitional growth as well, we just need to be careful and make sure they're the right ones. But we're excited. Even in a tough environment, we all get excited every day to come to work. We've got a phenomenal team and we're supported by phenomenal customers. And we certainly appreciate your support, too. So thank you. Have a great day and be safe. Operator : Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. Have a great and safe day.",

He will also be actively assisting me to ensure smooth leadership transition over the next couple of months. Now before talking about the market environment, I ask Theresa to comment on our first quarter financial performance. Theresa? Theresa E. Wagler: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Within a continued challenging global steel industry environment, we achieved solid financial results to the first quarter. Our net income was $63 million or $0.26 per diluted share, which was at the top of our guidance of between $0.22 and $0.26 per share. These results compared to sequential fourth quarter adjusted net income of $22 million or $0.09 per diluted share which excludes the impact of non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $1.13. And compares to prior year first quarter adjusted net income of $40 or $0.17 per diluted share, which excludes certain refinancing costs of $0.04. First quarter 2016 revenues were $1.7 billion, a 9% improvement over the sequential fourth quarter based on increased shipments from our steel operations. Our first quarter 2016 gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 14%, driven primarily by increased volume and represents a vast improvement from fourth quarter results of 9%. As a result, our operating income for the first quarter 2016 was $132 million compared to adjusted fourth quarter results of $47 million. For the first quarter, steel shipments increased 17% to 2.3 million tons as volumes improved across all divisions, but most significantly in Flat Roll. Flat Roll steel imports declined and customer inventory levels are better aligned with actual demand which is supporting increased domestic steel production and now also Flat Roll price increases as we head into the second quarter, especially for value added products. And as a reminder, about 40% of our Flat Roll volume is contractual and generally tied to a one to two months lag in CRU price index. First quarter 2016 steel platform average selling price have decreased $40 per ton to $574, more than offsetting decreased average crap costs per ton at $21. Despite lower metal spread, the improved volume resulted in significantly higher sequential operating income from our steel operations of $136, just over double fourth quarter results. Our sheet operations drove this increase improving operating income by over 180% with a 20% increase in shipments. While our Metals Recycling platform continues to operate in an extremely challenging environment, the team was able to achieve significantly improved profitability in the first quarter, recording $6 million of operating income versus the adjusted operating loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter. Increased domestic steel mill utilization and export volume resulted in improved recycling demand and pricing. Ferrous shipments increased 9%, while metal spread improved 36% compared to the sequential quarter. Additionally, internal ferrous shipments increased 27% and represented 60% of mills recycling quarterly volume, effectively levering the strength of our vertically integrated business profile. Our fabrication operations continued their ongoing strong financial performance in the first quarter, achieving operating income of $32 million, not only improving sequentially, but also a result only slightly below their record of $37 million set in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see steady non-residential construction demand resulting in a slight increase in the quarterly shipments which partially offset modest metal spread compression, as product pricing declined more than raw material steel costs. Based on first quarter coat activity, we could see some additional metals spread compression in the second quarter as Flat Roll steel prices have risen in the interim. During the first quarter 2016, we continue to generate significant cash flow from operations of $289 million. Working capital provided a $130 million of funding in the quarter. First quarter 2016 capital investments totaled $28 million. We currently estimate full-year capital expenditures to be in the range of $250 million, which includes the $100 million paint line addition at our Columbus Flat Roll Division, which is still expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2017. We increased our cash dividend in the first quarter, $0.14 per common share. Our history of sustained and increasing cash dividends demonstrates the confidence that we and our Board of Directors having the strength and consistency of our cash generation capability, financial position and optimism concerning our future. As demonstrated through the years, our business model generate strong cash flow through varying market cycles based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations that are diversified value added product offerings. We achieved record liquidity of $2.2 billion at March 31, comprised of our undrawn revolver and available cash of $977 million. During the quarter, total debt remained flat while net debt decreased $246 million to $1.6 billion. Our first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $214 million, resulting in the last 12 months EBITDA being $748 million. Net leverage then was 2.2x down from 2.7x at the end of the year. Our credit profile continues to be solidly aligned with our preferred through cycle net leverage of less than 3x, a testament to our disciplined approach to growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook continues to provide great optionality, having no meaningful maturities until 2019, but in the interim period having call provision flexibility. Looking forward we continue to believe that our capital structure and credit profile have the strength and flexibility to not only sustain current operations, but to support additional strategic growth. Thank you. Mark D. Millett: Super. Thanks, Theresa. As I've said on every call, the safety and welfare of our employees is our number one priority. Nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains better than the industry averages, and continues to improve toward our goal at zero incidents. Year-over-year the Company continues to improve with 2015 performance being the best so far. The trend continued into the first quarter. The team is doing a great job. Over 80% of our locations achieved zero recordable injuries so far this year. We also reduced our total recordable injury rate in the first quarter by 20% when compared to last year's full-year results and by 40% when compared to prior year's first quarter. We are definitely beginning the year in a even better position. And my sincere thanks go to the entire SDI team for their continued focus and dedication to our most important priority. The steel platform performed well in the first quarter. 2016 has certainly provided a changing landscape to the domestic flat roll market. Several positive macro shifts have resulted and significantly improved flat roll product pricing going into the second quarter. Flat roll steel import levels have declined and global steel pricing has appreciated. Customer inventory levels are better aligned to actual consumption, supporting higher domestic steel mill utilization and mill lead times have extended. While demand has remained steady, the supply side drivers have led to much improved market dynamics. Our Flat Roll Steel divisions operated basically at full capacity for the quarter, supported by the strong auto build and construction pick up. Although sequential long products steel shipments improved 9%, our long product mills was still challenged with end market weakness, operating at only 67% of their capacity. As the heavy equipment, agricultural, and energy markets remain weak, grabs for market share resulted in extensive published pricing discounts, especially in the structural steel arena. For the steel platform as a whole, driven by the our flat roll operations, our production utilization rate for the first quarter 2016 increased to 88% as compared to overall industry utilization of approximately 71%. Despite a material decline in scrap cost in the quarter, our metal spread contracted as average product pricing declined more than our actualized average scrap costs. Pricing declines were felt in all areas. However, the recent price increases in flat roll, especially for value-added coated product is sticking and we should see the positive impact in the coming months. The successful market and product diversification we achieved at Columbus during 2015 is one of the key differentiators for anticipated improved profitability in 2016. As a testament, Columbus achieved near record quarterly shipments in the first quarter of 2016 and increased value-added shipments almost 80% compared to the prior year's first quarter. The new paint line project is on budget and on schedule. The expectation for shipments to begin in the first quarter of 2017. The $100 million dollar investment will provide 250,000 tons of annual coating and Galvalume capability and further diversification in to higher margin products for Columbus. We already have two paint lines and Galvalume capability in Indiana and this new project allows for higher quality double wide steel and access to the Southern markets, including Mexico. We plan to sell surface-critical, appliance-grade steel, as well as construction-related products. Our steel platform also continues to benefit from our other organic growth investments, some of which began contributing in 2015 which should continue to increase momentum in 2016. The $26 million investment in premium rail, the $96 million investment in engineered special bar quality diversification and capacity expansion generally geared toward the automotive industry. This diversification has already facilitated increased mill utilization and cost compression during this weak heavy equipment and energy demand environment. And lastly the $22 million investment for an additional 600,000 tons of annual flat roll pickling capacity at our Butler Flat Roll Division. This will increase value-added sales and while deemphasizing commodity-grade hot roll. The team began operating the line in January and the production ramp up is going extremely well. Increased domestic steel mill utilization is also benefiting our Metals Recycling platform. While the platform remains free cash flow positive from \u201915, we now return to operating profitability in the first quarter of this year, as pricing stabilize, metal spreads expanded and volumes improved. Additionally, I want to thank the team for the cost reductions of approximately $25 million that were achieved during the last 18 to 24 months, through cost efficiencies and some location and shredder idling. Recycling environment definitely remains challenging. Many regional players in the industry are either for sale or headed to insolvency. As such, the number of active shredders has declined meaningfully, which should benefit the industry and the years ahead. iron ore cost, and cheap Chinese billet restraining exports : However, what we didn't anticipate was such a rapid and a significant increase in flat roll utilization and pricing. During that period of low obsolete scrap flows driven by low scale prices. In aggregate, these market dynamics resulted in the scrap price increases of about $10 to $15 a ton in March and another increase of $50 a ton in April. Looking forward, we expect the market to stabilize as the rush to regain mill inventories subsides and obsolete scrap flows improve. Combined with the expectation of a continued relative strong U.S dollar and relatively low scrap export volumes, we anticipate ample scrap supply and don't see drivers for further significant increases in ferrous scrap prices this year. The fabrication platform continues to achieve exceptional performance. Steady demand resulted in near record quarterly operating income of $32 million. The team is executing on all fronts and doing a phenomenal job. The CSI acquisition at the end of the last year's third quarter gained market share in deck achieving 34% in the first quarter this year compared to only 25% in prior year\u2019s first quarter. We also increased our joist market share over the same period from 32% to approximately 37%. Additionally, the acquisition provides an opportunity for steel supply options from our Columbus Flat Roll division. Over the last three years, the acquired assets averaged over 60,000 tons of annual flat roll steel purchases, predominantly galvanized. We plan to source a substantial amount of the steel from Columbus which will help further shift Columbus\u2019s product mix and increased mill utilization in weak demand environments. The power of pull through volume was certainly helpful in last year's steel environment. Our fabrication operations purchased over 300,000 t of steel from our steel operations in 2015. This year, the new millennium team continues to perform exceedingly well, leveraging our national footprint to gain market share. And the strength of their business provides positive insight into the continued growth with non-residential construction activity. Relative to the macro environment, the steel consuming sectors that were weak in 2015 such as energy, heavy equipment and agriculture will likely remain so in 2016. However, those that have been strong or recovering are also expected to continue this path, such as automotive and construction. 2016 forecast for these two largest domestic steel consuming sectors remains positive. Automotive has continued forecasting strength and overall construction spending continues to improve with additional forecasted growth in \u201916. SDI\u2019s growing exposure to both of these sectors through our Columbus Flat Roll Division, additional Long Products production capability, and growing fabrication operations. Driven by the strength from the U.S dollar, low iron ore cost and global over capacity, steel imports were the 2015 principal headwind. However, recent import levels have declined and the trade cases are likely to erode them further. Reduced imports, idling of domestic capacity, and increasing global pricing along with steady demand and rebalanced supply chain inventory, have created a positive pricing and volume environment for flat roll products. As raw material prices moderate, there is likely some margin expansion opportunity. Importantly, as we typically do, we are not waiting around. In order to help insulate ourselves from imports, part of our strategy is to not only develop strong customer relationships, but also manufacture products that are more difficult to compete with on a global basis, such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ steels and longer length rail. As such, we are able to mitigate some of the import impact and with our broad portfolio of value-added products, maintain higher steel mill utilization rates when compared to our peers. We continue to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and the execution of our long-term strategy. We also have additional company specific earnings catalysts and are well positioned for growth. Customer focus coupled with our market diversification and low-cost operating platforms support our ability to maintain our best-in-class industry performance. We believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities that will benefit our customers, our shareholders, employees, and communities alike. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we are focusing on growth opportunities to maximize our financial performance through market cycles. We will concentrate on growth opportunities that will improve the quality of our margins with a particular focus on downstream value-added growth to mitigate the impact of the imports and the inevitable cyclicality of our business. The strong character and determination of our employees are unmatched. They\u2019re a phenomenal group and I\u2019m proud to stand with them. We look forward to creating new opportunities for them, for our customers and shareholders in the months and years ahead. So, again, thank you for your time today. And Adam, we\u2019d like to open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Mark D. Millett: Good morning, Matthew Matthew Korn : Just a couple, if I could on the scrap market. Scrap tightness appears to be fairly profound right now, and so when you thing about flows improving on obsolete side, how much friction you think there could be from you or other recyclers having from shrunken headcount over the back half of 2015 or the potential bankruptcies, you said of certain shredders. Also don\u2019t know if there is a sense to any dealers are holding back supply right now on expectation of higher prices in the next month. And a quick follow-up there too on the industrial side for scrap, Bushland bundles, are you in the other AFB producers maybe seeing some of the effect of your own success here, because volumes are looking good numbers, look good, but maybe Bushland and bundles, I would expect those two necessarily proportionally increase in supply. So any comments there would be very helpful. Thanks. Russell B. Rinn: Well, I\u2019d say this is Russ, Matthew. The flows certainly have increased somewhat not to a overwhelming degree on the obsolete side. We have seen a increase, particularly in our retail side more so than in the Rigler flows from the dealers. I think the pricing -- the new pricing, the up $50 will bring up some more obsolete grades into the marketplace. But it's still, it hasn\u2019t manifested itself in a big way as of yet. Back to the prime side of the equation, again I think the prime levels are going to remain fairly, fairly consistent as they have all year, because the manufacturing, particularly automotive manufacturing has been strong. So, I don\u2019t -- as a proportion of the scrap flow that\u2019s available. It necessarily will have to down as a percentage. But at this point, it seems fairly static and while demand increases that will mean a percentage of that will have to be replaced by other grades. We do think that it's going to be reasonable enough to support the needs of the steel mills. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Kurtz : Hi, good morning, guys. Mark D. Millett: Good morning, Evan. Russell B. Rinn: Good morning. Evan Kurtz : So just maybe trying to put a couple of your comments together Mark, you mentioned that you thought pricing would start to have a positive impact in coming months. You\u2019ve also have an outlook for stabilization scrap. It is safe to say that you are expecting metal margins to expand in the two and 3Q? Mark D. Millett: Yes, I think so. I think obviously from a pricing standpoint as we mentioned in the last call, we have about 40% of our sheet products indexed against CIU. And as a -- sort of lag there of -- amounted to for that pricing to kick in fully. And so as we move into the second quarter, obviously the pricing profile should be dramatically different. And I\u2019m assuming that relatively moderate scrap markets for the quarter, I think one can imagine that margins will expand so. Evan Kurtz : Great. Thanks for confirming and if I may just kind of one follow-up on what\u2019s going on flat roll markets right now. One thing that some chatter I\u2019ve been here is integrated mills have been out. I\u2019m trying to take advantage of the spread between hot roll coil and cold rolled coil by maybe buying some hot roll coil from -- some of the many mills and rolling that, turning that into high value products. Is that something that you\u2019re participating and seeing and is that impacting your mix anyways, it\u2019s a big enough needle mover to shift to Mex. Mark D. Millett: Well, I think whatever happens is happening in that environment is positive for the industry in general, because obviously we are benefiting as an industry with the idling of Granite city of Fairfield of Ashland. And if they\u2019re moving those tons are around and utilizing others to provide or get help bank supply and keep those operations idle. I think that\u2019s very good for the industry and for the market in general. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Anthony Rizzuto : Thanks everybody and what a difference a couple of months make, boy. It\u2019s incredible. So my question is just a follow-up on scrap a little bit and your comments more comment and then Russ, are you guys concerned about exports which are period to be recovering after a lengthy period of dormancy and also scrap stabilizes near-term. Is there any further scope for price increases in flat roll steel do you think? Or is it more of a situation where you look for more margin gains as your spreads improve? Mark D. Millett: Well, I think from the standpoint of export scrap there is obviously some positive activity there and that is for I think helped the recent uptick in pricing. Again, I think the predominant increase in pricing in April was forced by -- just a surprising increase in utilization of the -- that regard [indiscernible] sheet melt in an environment were flows are still low and as Russ said, those flow should start to pick up with higher pricing. And I think if you consider that we operated our sheet mills at near capacity, its just say, and others are likely to be doing the same because of the increase in demand in the last couple of months. The incremental or the additional price scrap needs are going to be minimal and that should contain pricing as to at the current levels. I think from the standpoint of domestic pricing, it should be sustainable for sure. For the near-term, I think the market is looking good for us into Q3 and certainly early Q4. The Asian pricing, the trade cases have certainly eroded the import volumes. And the -- more importantly, the U.S., the global spread is very, very low and in fact it wasn\u2019t low. I do believe even with further upward momentum in pricing before you start seeing any major import interest. The Chinese market seems to be inspired. Their pricing is up and there is room in that spread to appreciate domestic pricing further, I do believe. Anthony Rizzuto : Fantastic. Mark, can you -- if I may ask a second question, perhaps you\u2019ve been pretty vocal about the section of the need potentially for Section 201. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate a bit on your thought process as it relates to that. Mark D. Millett: Well the thing, as an industry we are all firmly aligned that the existing trade loss need to be enforced, and they need to be enforced in a much more expeditious manner going forward. So there\u2019s total agreement there. On a sort of a intimated safeguard, I think my issue is that, a large portion of the hot band market which is pipe and tube has been absolutely decimated. And so it was one thing to erode imports coming into the country, but we still need a market -- a market place to sell our goods. And those folks need some protection. And I mean, its over 50% or 60% I do believe of their consumption is imported today, and they need some sort of safeguard before, again that industry gets decimated. So its -- I think personally there should be a long-term solution which is in place, just needs to be enforced and a short-term safeguard to safeguard that particular industry. Anthony Rizzuto : Thank you so much, Mark. I appreciate your insights. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one shorter term forward looking type of question. Typically Q2 and Q3 are very strong volume quarters relative to Q1, and often times it\u2019s actually meaningfully stronger. Any reasons to expect that pattern to be different this year? Mark D. Millett: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think the markets are generally good. As we said earlier, it\u2019s a little bit of a mix bag, off-road equipment, energy, agriculture is definitely soft. But the more intense consuming sectors, automotive and construction are remaining strong. I think the non-residential construction numbers both the macro indices but also our order book would suggest that we\u2019re going to see continued growth in that area, and we\u2019re fortunately highly leveraged. I think now we\u2019ve got about 2.5 million tons of excess capacity that we haven\u2019t been able to exploit yet most of which is correlated to construction. So we do see that second quarter and the third quarter being very, very strong as we go forward. Theresa E. Wagler: The another one thing that I would add to that David is that, with the big bump that you saw in the first quarter that was related primarily to the Flat Roll Division and the Flat Roll Divisions were basically at very high capacity already. So any additional volume improvement you see would need to come through markets that are attached to long product mill. David Gagliano : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk a little bit about the -- any changes you\u2019ve seen in the order books specific to any of the particular end markets et cetera? Thanks. Mark D. Millett: I don\u2019t think there was any basic change David, and honestly against the areas that were weak in 2015 will continue to be weak. Automotive remains very strong. Residential, I think although it ticked down a little bit here in the last month and so, year-over-year it\u2019s improved and will continue to improve. Our garage door business is off the charts. So there is residential strength, we do believe. And non-residential construction for all reports from as I said macro indices and from our customers and also just the order book within New Millennium. They have year-over-year much higher backlog and quote activity right there. We feel quite optimistic that there is going to be incremental growth. The apparent consumption last year was about 108 million tons and we would love to see that growing to perhaps 111 million, 112 million tons this year. David Gagliano : All right, good. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Gambardella : Yes. Good morning, Mark and Theresa, and congratulations on another good quarter. Just looking back today's net debt to capital at 35%, it\u2019s the lowest number in net debt to capital that you\u2019ve had since 2006 I think. And since 2006, you\u2019ve grown your steel shipments 75%. Can you give us some perspective; you\u2019ve had tremendous success basically since the company originated. But can you give us some feel for what type of growth and then, on your capital structure with the net debt to capital coming down to such low level, what your plans are for use of capital going forward maybe tied into that growth? Mark D. Millett: Certainly, Michael. And as you point out, I think we clearly demonstrated the earnings strength -- the cash flow strength of our business model through tough times. We\u2019ve identified several, what I would consider capital effective organic growth opportunities; obviously we\u2019re in the middle of building the paint line in Columbus. But we have about 400,000 tons or so of excess hot metal capacity of the structural mill. We have excess production capability at Roanoke, and we need to do something with the hot and Steel West Virginia which will ultimately I think give us even a greater hot metal capability. And Glenn is in charge with finding out the best effort for that excess capacity. We also are expanding the hot-roll galv line in Butler which will be a meaningful event for us. So there\u2019s a lot of organic opportunity. Again that cash won't be expended in the near-term in the next six months or so, and they\u2019re not massive -- massive consumers of capital either. What we\u2019re actively exploring, venturing value add opportunities with a very specific eye on pull through volume such as we -- the model that we see at New Millennium it helps dramatically in the down cycle to maintain utilization, maintain cash flow and a more uniformed earnings profile. And also sort of mitigation of imports looking at opportunities that we can separate ourselves from the import world that this is going to continue for the years to come. And as we do that in parallel, we\u2019re obviously exploring and evaluating the many M&A opportunities that are coming to market currently. Michael Gambardella : What about on the -- in terms of using some capital to give back to shareholder and dividend? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes. So, Mike we do want to keep that positive different profile. But we also want to keep in mind that we\u2019re a cyclical industry. And so we want to make sure that it\u2019s sustainable at the levels that it is because we view dividend that\u2019s forever. So it\u2019s definitely one of the outlooks that we\u2019re going to be looking at and we look at other outlets to return to shareholders as well. And to your point the credit profile that we have today is extraordinarily strong. And so, I think right now it\u2019s a matter of waiting for a period of time to see where the inorganic opportunities fallout as they come to bear for us to look at those and over the next call it 12 months or so. And then as we\u2019re generating cash flow on the way we\u2019ll make some decisions possibly do some other allocations as well and maybe not just in the organic arena, but the organic and then their possibilities. So I think right now we\u2019re looking at everything. But the most important strategic move for us as Mark mentioned was to look for pull through volume and to make sure that we\u2019re using our -- the assets we have in place as efficiently as we can. Michael Gambardella : Okay. Well, it\u2019s a great place to be. So again congratulations. Mark D. Millett: Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Timna Tanners : Hi. Good morning. Mark D. Millett: Good morning, Timna. Timna Tanners : So I wanted to drill down a little bit into the discussion on flat-rolls market is really strong and everything we\u2019re hearing is quite robust. Steel Dynamics has a tradition of offering or opening their order book later than piers. So I just wanted to ask you if that\u2019s still the case, and ask about how to think about utilization in flat-roll going forward. Did you max out Q1? Is there a little more tonnage to expect going forward or is there still run rate we should expect in this market environment? Mark D. Millett: On the flat-roll side I would say there is a little more gas in our tank, but not much. We operated at a great rate in the first quarter. I think there was some commentary from the -- from you folks, regarding our pricing and maybe a little disappointment there to the level of pricing given the environment we\u2019re in. And again, I think that is focused principally to flat-roll and to the fact that 40% of our output is indexed to CRU, and there\u2019s a one month, two month lag there. Additionally the tax, because of the business model [indiscernible] -- they tend to be looking about two months out. So its kind of again it slows the uptick in pricing. Our overall philosophy remains to keep a short order book hot band is not much more than four weeks. I would tell you that our Butler facility has been doing that for many, many, many years. Our Columbus team has not necessarily done that in the past. And so coming into the first quarter in January we were probably stretched out a little bit more at Columbus than we would typically be, but that is well in hand there. Timna Tanners : Okay, that\u2019s great. So just a follow-up to make sure I understand that you\u2019re talking about; I think we just alluded to the margin compression and some surprise around that. So that what you\u2019re saying is that, that\u2019s really a function of some of the lag effect in pricing due to the CRU indices and also the way that Columbus had operated somewhat in the past and maybe going forward? Mark D. Millett: Correct. Theresa E. Wagler: But in addition to that, Timna remember the long product pricing came down as well in industry, I mean it crossed the industry. So its not just flat-roll, that price that you have is a mixed average. Timna Tanners : No, of course. Okay, that makes sense. All right. Thanks for the help. Operator : Thank you. Our next comes from the line of Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jorge Beristain : Hi, guys. Jorge, with DB here. And congratulations Mark and Theresa on your results. I just had a question really drilling down a little bit on your utilization. You guys are at 88%, rest of industry is at 71%, you\u2019ve obviously picked up share in the kind of environment we saw due to those mill closure that some competitors. But do you see with the improved pricing that there is a risk that you could kind of give back some volumes to your competitors? That\u2019s my first question. Mark D. Millett: No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we\u2019re well placed. Some of the market share we gained such as in Columbus is on the value add end, the coated arena. We struggled or that facility struggled a couple of years ago with quality. And I think the teams Butler and Columbus working together have done a phenomenal job getting the quality to where it should be. We\u2019ve reclaimed a lot of those -- those former customers and they\u2019re loyal customers, and we should retain them. So now, I think we\u2019re in a good spot. We have gained market share. We gained market share on flat-roll. We gained market share dramatically on our fabrication division, and I\u2019m comfortable where we are. Jorge Beristain : Great. And my second question was on the Columbus paint line. Could you talk a little bit about what type of contracts you\u2019re now able to get with your new promised paint line there? And how much of those would be domestic versus Mexico based or export contract. If you could just also talk about the sort of type of pricing that you\u2019re able to achieve for a painted product. Is it going to have a bit more defensiveness vis-\u00e0-vis imports and vis-\u00e0-vis the underlying CRU pricing? Mark D. Millett: Well I think for sure the more customized the product is, the more defensive you can be. Also the margins in that business are a little better and it gives you flexibility to protect your turf so to speak. From the standpoint of contracts, again it\u2019s a little early for us to be securing definitive volumes there. There will be a shift with some of our products from Butler and Jeffersonville [indiscernible] immediately to give us a base load. But again we don\u2019t have contracts per say down there as of yet. Is that fair, Glenn? Glenn Pushis : Absolutely it\u2019s a little early to make any agreements in place. But the supply chains will naturally dictate some of its work and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll work first to optimize. Jorge Beristain : Okay. And sorry, could you just discuss a little bit of how the pricing for that kind of product would work. Is it still going to be based off of an underlying, towards the index or is it going to be more towards like a fixed period type of pricing? Mark D. Millett: No, it will be certainly market driven. Jorge Beristain : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Philip Gibbs : Hi, good morning. Mark D. Millett: Good morning, Phil. Philip Gibbs : I had a question on the SBQ business. It looked like it picked up a decent bit quarter-on-quarter. Is that an indication to you that the de-stocking maybe a baiting or a pickup in auto or market share. How do we think about that momentum right now for you? Glenn Pushis : This is, Glenn Pushis, Phil. Philip Gibbs : Hi, Glenn. Good morning. Glenn Pushis : Good morning to you. Phil, the engineered Bar Products Division, our capacity utilization for the first quarter was right at 72% and not in cash than 60% rolling. In those markets the automotive is still very strong for them. They had a great new first quarter with a small mill that they fired up there last year and ran some good tonnage through that facility. So that helped to flatten the first quarter. So if you think they were growing market share in that arena, I would tell you it\u2019s in the small bar area with the start up of that new facility down there last year. But again a typical, you\u2019ve heard Mark say the automotive is strong, ag and energy is still soft. The coal finished business has been I\u2019d say stable, steady as it is well in the quarters. So that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re at and what we see coming. Philip Gibbs : Should we expect the pick up in the business in terms of the volumes from this level or more stability than anything until some of those later cycle markets kick in? Glenn Pushis : Yes, I\u2019d agree with this to your later comment. I think its more, just a stable market right now until we see what happens in the second and third quarter. Philip Gibbs : Okay. I appreciate that. And Theresa, any comments you can help us on with the mix in flat-roll? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes, I can. So for the first quarter across Flat Roll Group, hot-rolled and P&L shipments were 790,000 tons, cold-rolled was a 129,000 tons, and coated was 738,000 tons. Philip Gibbs : I appreciate that. And I have one last one here, the CapEx started the year off pretty modestly. Are you still on track to spend that $250 million more backend loaded or have you pulled some of that off the table? Theresa E. Wagler: No, the expectations are a lot the best estimate I would give you would beat around $250 million; it will probably be a bit less than that. But with the paint line it\u2019s definitely loaded more towards the back half of the year. Philip Gibbs : Okay. And I know the inventories are low right now. Are you expecting any further free cash flow generation this year given that you probably have a little bit of improvement in working capital in terms of it going higher? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes, we did some framework changes in the working capital which should reduce some of it effectively from hereon now. But you\u2019re right; the pricing moves will have an impact as well as maybe some inventory volumes on the raw material side. And so, I would expect the second quarter could have some draw from working capital both from receivables and an inventory perspective. But then as you go to the second half of the year I think that, that pretty much gets mitigated and working capital won't have that much of an impact. Philip Gibbs : But still some expectation for further free cash down the rest of this year. Theresa E. Wagler: Perfectly. Yes, absolutely. Philip Gibbs : Okay. Thanks so much. Have a great morning. Mark D. Millett: Thanks. You too. Glenn Pushis : Thanks, Phil. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford from Bradford Research. Please go ahead. Charles Bradford : Good morning. Mark D. Millett: Good morning, Charles. Charles Bradford : Over the last year or so the rail industry has been hit pretty hard by the debacle in coal and to some extent the reduced movement of oil by rail. Have you seen the railroads switching at all to maybe repair and re-railing if you will some of their other lines to offset their maybe reduced needs for the rail for especially coal? Mark D. Millett: Well, I think Chuck, the Class 1 railroads in particular and obviously have trimmed down their capital spend, and that will influence a little bit of their track expansion plans. Repair and maintenance is ongoing. Our shipments of the rail are still projected to be in the kind of the 240,000 to 260,000 tons for the year. I do believe, Glenn? Glenn Pushis : Yes. That\u2019s right, Mark. Mark D. Millett: And I think you\u2019re right. There is a little bit of a shift to maintenance away from sort of mainline track build. But we seem to be continuing to pick up little market share in that product line. Charles Bradford : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aldo Mazzaferro from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Aldo Mazzaferro : Hi. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019ve got a question on the mix at Columbus, Mark. I read that you had 80% increase in the value add volume on a year-to-year basis there. Can you frame that for us in terms of what to find to that value added, and what percentage of the mix that value added was? Theresa E. Wagler: So from the value added perspective Aldo, we\u2019re actually probably being a little bit light on that, because we\u2019re just including anything that beyond hot band that there\u2019s actually some hot band that I think, lets just say value added as well. So that number really is higher. And so really its just 45% hot-rolled for them and the rest was P&L and cold-rolled and hot-rolled and cold-rolled galvanized. Aldo Mazzaferro : Okay. Are you using the degasser there very much now? Mark D. Millett: [Indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro : The vacuum that you look at. The vacuum degasser at Columbus is that the -- like how much utilized was that in the quarter, did you say? Mark D. Millett: We currently utilized vacuum degassing for approximately 5% of the grades and its development work primarily right now. There are some continuing products, but part of our long going strategy to get more into automotive, we usually device more and more each month. Aldo Mazzaferro : Great. And then one follow-up, Theresa. You mentioned something just now about the, you changed your framework in the working capital. Can you say if there was anything unusual in that first quarter big source out of payables and inventory? Theresa E. Wagler: Yes, that was really -- those were really changes that we made throughout last year. Aldo, we\u2019ll just have a reemphasis on making sure that we\u2019re being disciplined in watching what the raw material volumes are, what finished goods volumes are. And there\u2019s also been a change at Columbus, and there\u2019s probably still some opportunity there just based on how we typically operate versus how Columbus may have operated with their working capital in the past. Aldo Mazzaferro : Great. Congratulations on the balance sheet, Theresa. Theresa E. Wagler: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Yu from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Richard Yu : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark D. Millett: Good morning. Richard Yu : Glenn, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your acquisition plans in the acquisition environment. Maybe given your cash position, what kind of acquisitions are you looking for? What are you seeing in that market? And would you look to increase your position in markets that has been weak such as oil and gas? Glenn Pushis : I think we\u2019ve already spoken to the extent of that actually, because again its focused on value add downstream type opportunities. We want to enhance the quality of our margins. We want to see greater pull through volume so that we can at least slow -- mitigate some of the cyclicality of our earnings profile so that we have some higher highs, but higher lows going forward. I think one needs to recognize that we\u2019re intensely global industry today and that imports are going to be with us forever. And so we need to ensure that our business model tends to insulate us from an import pressure. Additionally again the financial stress in the system is bringing a lot of opportunities to market and we just assess those as they show up and see where some opportunities may or may not align with our long-term plan. Richard Yu : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing comments. Mark D. Millett: Thanks Adam, and thanks to all of you that remained on the call for your support of our company. We have an absolutely phenomenal team. I think [indiscernible] how we\u2019re differentiated as a team and as a business model, we\u2019ve colossal cash flow generation again in tough times and it will continue. It gives us great opportunity for the future. So again thank you to you all, and to those customers on the line, my sincere thanks for your support. And for the employees on the line, guys and girls stay safe and keep doing what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re making us a special company. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Once again ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Theresa. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. I hope and trust you are all enjoying the summer, and I'm going to have safe summer with that. It seems difficult to believe that we are already halfway through 2016. I guess time flies when you're having a lot of fun. But thankfully, we have a notably improved profile compared to last year. To begin this morning, I would ask Theresa to comment on our second quarter financial performance. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. With a continued challenging global steel industry environment, the teams achieved strong operational and financial results. For the second quarter 2016, our net income was $142 million or $0.58 per diluted share, slightly above our guidance of between $0.53 per share and $0.57 per share, really based on the strengths from the Flat Roll Group. These results are over double those of sequential and prior year quarters. Sequential first quarter net income was $63 million or $0.26 per diluted share and prior-year second quarter adjusted net income was $53 million or $0.22 per diluted, which excludes expenses primarily associated with idling our Minnesota operations. Second quarter 2016 revenues were $2 billion, a 16% improvement over the sequential first quarter based on both increased shipments and product pricing from our steel operations. Our second quarter 2016 gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 19%, driven by the improved performance at our steel operations, most specifically from our Flat Roll Group. This represents a significant improvement of our near-term history, including first quarter 2016 performance of 14%. As a result, our operating income for the second quarter was $256 million, compared to first quarter results of $132 million, a 94% improvement. For the second quarter, steel shipments increased 9% to 2.5 million tons, as volumes improved across all divisions except in special bar quality products. The SBQ market continues to be challenged by weak demand dynamics. Conversely, domestic flat roll steel utilization is strong, as imports have declined and customer inventory levels are better balanced with actual demand. Even though second quarter platform utilization was 95%, it's a bit misleading as the Flat Roll Group produced over the theoretical quarterly capacity, offsetting lower utilization at the structural and engineered bar divisions, which operated at 82% and 53% respectively. Second quarter 2016 steel platform average selling prices increased $67 (sic) [$66] (04:41) per ton to $640, outpacing increased average scrap cost [ph] at $74 (04:47) per ton. Increased metal spread and continuing improvement in volume resulted in our second consecutive quarter of significantly higher profitability generated by the steel platform. Operating income was $276 million, just over double first quarter results. Our Flat Roll Group continued to drive this performance with a 159% increase in group operating income based on an 8% increase in shipments coupled with meaningful metal spread expansion. While our metals recycling platform continues to operate in an extremely challenging environment, the team was able to achieve significantly improved profitability, recording $15 million of operating income versus $6 million in the sequential first quarter. Increased domestic steel mill utilization resulted in improved recycling demand and pricing. Second quarter 2000 (sic) [2016] (05:38) shipments increased 3% and ferrous metal spread increased 30% compared to the sequential quarter. Additionally, internal ferrous shipments represented 60% of OmniSource's second quarter volume, effectively levering the strength of our vertically integrated business profile. Non-residential construction demand was steady throughout much of the United States, but negatively affected by inclement weather in the Southwest, resulting in a slight decrease in our second quarter fabrication shipments, but order entry and coating activity remained strong. As we suggested on the first quarter call, fabrication experienced metal spread compression, as higher steel prices increased raw material costs, while product pricing modestly declined. As a result, second quarter 2016 operating income from our fabrication operations was $24 million, a decrease of $8 million when compared to the first quarter. Although we anticipate stronger fabrication volumes, we accept to see additional metal spread compression in the third quarter, as higher price flat roll steel inventories flow through the system. During the second quarter 2016, we generated cash flow from operations of $158 million, as working capital used $136 million in the quarter due to increased sales. For the first half of 2016, we generated $447 million. First half 2016 capital investments totaled $63 million. We currently estimate full-year 2016 capital expenditures to be in a range of $225 million, obviously weighted to the second half of the year. And this includes the paint line addition at our Columbus Flat Roll Division, which is still expected to begin operations in the first quarter of 2017. We maintained our cash dividend in the second quarter at $0.14 per common share. Our history of sustained and increasing cash dividends demonstrates the confidence that we and our directors have in the strength and consistency of our cash flow generation capability. As demonstrated through the years, our business model generates strong cash flow through varying market cycles based on the low, highly variable cost structure of our operations and our diversified value-added product offerings. We achieved record liquidity of over $2.2 billion at June 30, 2016, comprised of our undrawn revolver and available cash of $1.1 billion. During the second quarter, total debt remained flat while net debt decreased $82 million to $1.5 billion. Our second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $340 million and trailing 12-month EBITDA $903 million, resulting in net leverage of 1.7 times, down from 2.7 times at the end of the year. Our credit profile continues to be solidly aligned with our preferred due cycle net leverage of less than three times. Additionally, our debt maturity outlook continues to provide great optionality, having no meaningful maturities until 2019, but in the interim periods having provision call flexibility. Looking forward, we continue to believe that our capital structure and credit profile have the strength and flexibility to not only sustain current operations, but to support additional strategic growth. Mark? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Theresa. Some may think it redundant, but I want to reiterate on each call that safety and welfare of our employees remains our number one value. Nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains better than industry averages, but our goal is to have a zero incident environment. We've reduced our total recordable injury rate in the first half of 2016 by a further 15% when compared to last year's full-year results. The team continues to do a phenomenal job, and we're on track for another record performance this year, but everyone must remain focused. My sincere thanks go to the entire SDI team for their dedication to our most important priority. The steel platform performed well in the second quarter. 2016 has certainly provided a changing landscape to the domestic flat roll market. Several positive macro shifts have resulted in significantly improved flat roll product pricing. Year-over-year, first half flat roll steel import levels have declined and customer inventory levels are better aligned to actual consumption, all supporting higher domestic sheet mill utilization. While demand has remained steady, these supply side drivers have led to much improved market dynamics. Our flat roll steel mills operated at full capacity during the second quarter, supported by the automotive and construction sectors. Although conversely, even though sequential long products steel shipments improved 14%, they operated at about 75% of their full production capability, with engineered bar being the most challenged. So, for the steel platform as a whole, our production utilization rate for the second quarter of 2016 increased to 95% compared to the overall domestic steel industry that's been operating at around 74%. Despite a significant increase in second quarter scrap costs, our overall average steel metal spread improved, as average product pricing outpaced the increased costs. However, as a subgroup, our combined long product divisions actually experienced flat pricing and metal spread compression in the second quarter. Although overall construction continues to improve, the competitive landscape for structural steel, merchant sheets, and engineered bar is extremely aggressive. The robust increase in second quarter 2016 long product group shipments was due to the customers buying ahead of the significant scrap increase in April and in May. While we anticipate third quarter of 2016 metal spread expansion for the long products group, the buy-ahead customer activity will likely result in slightly reduced related shipments. Part of the investment thesis from our recently announced $126 million planned acquisition of Vulcan Threaded Products is the potential volume improvement for our Engineered Special Bar Products division that could result as being a supplier to Vulcan. Historically, Vulcan has purchased nearly 20,000 tons of steel from SDI. But based on our production capabilities, this could increase to as much as 30,000 tons to 50,000 tons, just under 10% of our Engineered Bar division's 2015 shipments. Vulcan purchases special bar quality steel products for the manufacture and sale of higher-margin threaded steel rod, cold-finished bar, and heat-treated bar. We're excited to soon welcome the Vulcan employees to the SDI family. Vulcan has a great reputation in the industry for supplying high-quality products with excellent customer service. We have recently received the required regulatory approvals for the deal and hope to close the transaction shortly. At Columbus, the successful market and product diversification that we achieved during 2015 is one of the key differentiators for the improved profitability that we are realizing this year. As an example, Columbus achieved record six months production stats in the first half of 2016 and continues to increase their value-added product capabilities. The new paint line project is on budget and on schedule, with expectations for painted product shipments to begin in the first quarter of 2017. The total $100 million investment will provide 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and further diversification into higher-margin products for Columbus. We already have two paint lines and a Galvalume capability in Indiana. And this new project allows for higher-quality, double-wide steel and access to the southern markets, including Mexico. We plan to sell surface-critical, appliance-grade steel as well as construction-related products from this line. As a part of the project, this month, we're installing equipment in one of the Columbus' galvanizing lines to allow them to sell value-added Galvalume products into the construction sector. We anticipate the installation and resulting disruption to result in about $5 million of lost earnings in the third quarter 2016. Our steel platform also continues to benefit from other organic growth investments, some of which began contributing in 2015 but should continue to increase momentum in 2016. The $26 million investment in premium rail is continuing to improve the ratio of premium to standard rail shipments. The $96 million investment in engineered special bar quality diversification and capacity expansion generally are geared toward automotive industry. This diversification has already facilitated increased mill utilization and cost compression during the ongoing weak heavy equipment and energy demand environment. Finally, the $22 million investment for an additional 600,000 tons of annual flat roll pickling capability at our Butler Flat Roll division, which will increase value-added sales while deemphasizing commodity-grade hot roll. The team began operating the line in January and has already achieved 75% utilization. The continued increase in domestic steel mill utilization is also benefiting our metals recycling platform. The team was able to achieve meaningful improvement in profitability for the second consecutive quarter. The recycling environment remains challenging. Many regional players in the industry are either for sale or headed into insolvency. As such, the number of active shredders has declined, which should benefit the industry in the years ahead. Earlier this year, the rapid and significant increase in flat roll steel mill utilization and product pricing during a period of low obsolete scrap flows resulted in significant ferrous scrap price increases. April pricing increased about $50 per ton followed by another increase in May of about $20 per ton to $30 per ton. But looking forward, we expect the pricing environment to decrease somewhat and stabilize, as the rush to regain mill inventories subsides and obsolete scrap flows, perhaps, improve. We saw this occur as June and July's price trend was basically unchanged for prime grades, but then $10 per ton to $20 per ton for obsolete grades. Combined with the expectation of a continued relative strong U.S. dollar and relatively low scrap exports, we anticipate ample scrap supply and don't see likely drivers for significant increases in ferrous scrap prices. The fabrication platform continues their ongoing strong performance. Since our acquisition of additional deck assets in September 2015, we've gained considerable market share for deck, achieving 31% for the first half of 2016, compared to only 24% in the same timeframe last year. Additionally, the acquisition provides an opportunity for steel supply options from our Columbus Flat Roll division. Over the last three years, the acquired assets averaged over 60,000 tons of annual flat roll steel purchases, predominantly galvanized and predominantly from our competitors. We plan to source a substantial amount of the steel from Columbus, which will help further shift Columbus' product mix and increase mill utilization during weak demand environment. The power of pull-through volume was certainly helpful in last year's steel environment. Our fabrication operations purchased just over 300,000 tons of steel from our steel operations in 2015 and has already purchased over 160,000 tons in 2016. The New Millennium team continues to perform extremely well, levering our national footprint to gain market share. The strength of this business provides positive insight into the continued growth of non-residential construction activity. We continue to see strong ore activity and expect increasing volumes. But the increased cost of flat roll steel, which benefits our $7 million ton capacity Flat Roll Group, will result in further margin compression for our fabrication operations in the third quarter. This natural hedge continues to benefit the overall company. Relative to the macro environment, the steel-consuming sectors that were weak in 2015 such as energy, heavy equipment, and agriculture will likely remain so in 2016. However, those that have been strong or recovering are expected to continue this path, such as automotive and construction. 2016 forecast for these two largest domestic steel-consuming sectors remains positive. Automotive has continued forecasting strength. And overall, construction spending continues to improve with additional forecasted growth in 2016. SDI is growing exposure to both of these sectors through our Columbus Flat Roll division, additional Long Products production capability, and growing fabrication operations. Driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar, low iron ore costs and global overcapacity, steel imports were 2015's principal headwind. However, recent import levels have declined and the trade cases are likely to erode them further. Reduced imports, idling of domestic capacity, and relatively higher global pricing, along with steady demand and rebalanced supply chain inventory, have created a positive pricing and volume environment for flat roll products. As raw material prices moderate, there's likely margin expansion opportunity. As in the past, importantly, we are not waiting in order to help inflate ourselves from the imports. Part of our strategy is to not only develop strong customer relationships but to also manufacture products that are more difficult to compete with on a global basis, such as painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ steel, and long length rail. As such, we're able to mitigate some of the import impact and, with our broad portfolio of value-added products, able to maintain higher steel mill utilization rates when compared to our domestic peers. As you've seen, we continue to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and the execution of our long-term strategy. We also have additional company-specific earnings catalysts and are well positioned for growth. Customer focus, coupled with our market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, support our ability to maintain our best-in-class industry performance. We believe we are uniquely poised to capitalize on growth opportunities that will benefit our customers, shareholders, employees, and communities. Driven to maintain a sustainable differentiated business, we're focusing on growth opportunities to maximize our financial performance throughout market cycles. We will concentrate on growth opportunities that will improve the quality of our margins, with a particular focus on downstream value-added growth to mitigate the impact of imports and the evitable cyclicality of our business. The strong character and determination of our employees are absolutely unmatched. They are a phenomenal group, and I'm proud to stand with them. We look forward to creating new opportunities for them, for our customers, and our shareholders in the months and years ahead. So, again, thank you for your time today. And Brenda, we'd love to open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please, go ahead with your questions. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, and good morning, Mark and Theresa. My question is, one, you've done such a tremendous job at optimizing your flat roll plants at Butler in Columbus. I'm wondering how much further is there to go in terms of volume growth and aside from mix improvements that you clearly are implementing at these facilities. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the team at Butler has done an absolute phenomenal job. If you look back, when a little English man was running the place up there, we were around about 2.2 million tons \u2013 about 2.4 million tons, and all they had to do is kick me out. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Right. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so, they went from 2.4 million tons, I think \u2013 they probably have about 3.1 million tons of capability there, way above the \u2013 way, way above the rated capacity. I would say, Columbus, they've already demonstrated on the half side, the ability to get around about 3.4 million tons, and that's without the \u2013 so the prodding and the innovation and the creativity of the employee base. And I would say there is good room for movement there. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. May I ask another question? I know they said one question, but I'd I like to ask a question on the market, if I could. You mentioned, Mark, about the imports that have come down. Obviously, that's been a key shift in supply this year. But the import license data has been beginning to trend higher and, obviously, looking at higher imports later this year. And we're starting to see some signs that the market is becoming a little bit less tight, if you will. I was wondering if you could just address that along with your comments about the scrap, maybe, being a little bit sloppy here over the near-term. And just generally speaking, how do you think about pricing and where we are in the market today? And do you think we've hit a peak for hot-rolled at this juncture? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, that was a compound question, Tony. Let me start off by saying, I think import levels are down about 25% year-to-date. But we do, indeed, see activity picking up a little bit. The global spread for hot band is in excess of $200 a ton today. And so, it's natural for that to occur. But I think it's been amazing that the import pricing, though, remains pretty resilient, I would say, unusually resilient and maybe there is import offers now about 50 bucks off in the domestic market. And as I said, that's a little unusual, a little more resilient. The trade constraints have totally eliminated China and the other primary importers from the marketplace. And import offers are coming in through what we would consider somewhat non-traditional sources, Vietnam and others. And those are a little less accessible, and the network from a customer base importing those steels is a little less reliable at this moment in time. And in any event, import pressure is not going to materialize in any great form in Q4. And I am somewhat confident that it's not going to return to the levels that really imploded on markets at the end of whenever that was, 2014 and early 2015. From a pricing standpoint, cold-rolled sheet and coated, they remain very, very, very strong. Lead times are around about eight weeks. In the hot-rolled coil arena, you're right, the market seems a little hesitant. And I think they're uncertain of its direction. There are lead times, perhaps, down to two weeks to three weeks today. And I think it's because some are anticipating softening, given that the high global spread and the recent deterioration in scrap pricing. And so, they're not placing orders today. They really are just placing exactly what they need. There's a good side to that. Yeah. The recent MSCI data shows that inventory is at 2.3 months on a shipping basis, while actual shipping \u2013 or shipments are strong. And I think that that's a good position to be in, in all honesty. I think there could be actually an opportunity for restocking and that they can hang out there and hope for lower pricing. But the scrap arena is going to support the prices where it is today. We don't see any real downtick in scrap pricing, so that's going to support it. I think the lean inventory will support pricing in the region it is today. Does it come off $10 or $20? Yeah, maybe. But it is certainly not going to implode. And you never know, history may repeat itself and, invariably, it has in our industry, where inventories, service center inventories get real, real tight, then all of a sudden, folks, they all seem to jump into the market at the same time. Lead times stretch out because the domestic industry, from a production capability, just can't recover as quickly and you actually get a price pressure environment, so time will tell. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for all that color, Mark. I greatly appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please, go ahead with your question. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the U.S. auto market, we saw U.S. auto production had a nice June after some softness earlier in the spring. I'm wondering, are you seeing any signs, as you're out there expanding that business, that there is any step-down in optimism on growth among the OEMs, the parts makers? And, secondly, have you had any substantial wins within that industry, within that market over the quarter which you could highlight? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not so sure if there is optimism for further growth in the automotive world. I think they are ahead of the build right today, and I think everyone would forecast that, that build rate is going to be maintained, going forward. So I think it's a very healthy environment to be in. On the market share, we have \u2013 as we've advertised or communicated in the past calls, have had a dedicated sort of initiative in Columbus in particular to go direct to the automotive producers. We've got a team of eight folks, nine folks, 10 folks together, and it's unbelievable traction that they have gained. And I think for 2016, we're on track for about 180,000 tons of automotive shipments, which is up dramatically year-over-year. And we're looking for sort of that amount of gain, in addition to that, in 2017. Our target is just round about 500,000 tons, maybe, a little bit more, but 500,000 tons of output at Columbus eventually. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I was going to say that just another thing. If you look at the growth expected in Mexico from an armored production perspective, that also bodes well for Columbus, given the freight that we have in, in Mexico. So that's another thing that we are looking at. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. Let me just really quickly follow up. Your cost performance has looked good. I'm wondering outside of raw materials, with the advantage that you're getting from the high capacity utilization, where are you when it comes to your conversion cost performance at Columbus or even the whole system versus a year ago, and where you'd expected to be around this time? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Without going into specifics, I kind of let into a little bit in my opening comments that the utilization number is a bit misleading because at 95%, it's really heavily weighted towards the fact that Butler and Columbus actually operated at 105% to 110% of their rated capacity for the quarter, which obviously isn't sustainable for a year, but they did it in the quarter. And so, that masks some of the capability and the opportunity that we're going to have at the long products. So there's still some meaningful cost compression that we should have across, actually, the structural mill and definitely the Engineered Bar division. So there is some leverage there. And as it relates to Columbus, Columbus conversion costs are very strong right now, being that we brought them very much in line. There was a lot of progress that was made in 2015, yet there are still some financial obligations that are outstanding, and we are trying to work through those. They have varying dates of expiration. And so, that's probably still another $5 to $8 a ton of additional cost that we are incurring at Columbus that we hope one day we won't have to. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Theresa. It's very helpful. Best of luck for the rest of the quarter. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Matt. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Loop Capital. Please, go ahead with your questions. Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets : Hey, Mark. Hey Theresa. Thanks for all of the detail. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the continued efforts to gain market share in the long rail business. And then, as more of a bond guy question, you are now at BB+ with a positive outlook, given that you're at 9.6 times interest coverage. Is there a chance you become accidentally investment-grade even though you've sort of stated that kind of mid-double B is your target range? And if the rating agencies stick you to sort of an investment-grade range, do you feel like you're not growing fast enough or anything like \u2013 I guess I am asking about, do you plan that will be aggressive enough on the acquisition front that investment-grade may not be something that's in the cards pretty soon? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I will let Mark take the rail question first. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, I think we have targeted about 300,000 tons of rail for the mill. And it's not a question, really, of us searching for a lot more than that market share. We need to balance the mill between beam and rail products. We are, obviously, pushing the percentage of premium rail as much as we can, and that is being well, well received today. And in fact, I think we now \u2013 we had one railroad that just was the final one \u2013 which one was that? Unknown Speaker : Canadian National. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Canadian National, yeah. Canadian National finally came and approved our product. So we are approved at all major Class 1 railroads today. We're going to fall short of the 300,000 tons, I do believe, this year. We are aiming for, I think 260,000-ish tons, 270,000-ish tons, because as you appreciate the Class 1 railroads have throttled back their CapEx spending pretty dramatically. But we're on target, I think, for 260,000-ish tons for the year. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And related to the second part of the question, Brett, we're very, very open and transparent with the agencies. And so, I think, S&P just came out and moved our position of liquidity from strong to exceptional, which I'm not sure what that means, it sounds good. So we're very open with them about our plans for growth, and that's both inorganic and organic. And so, I don't think we're accidently going to become IG. I think at some point, we will, just by the nature of our cash flow generation and the maturity at which we're gaining on the operational platform. But right now, we feel like we're really strongly positioned in that BB plus range. We've got access to all the different capital markets. We have great support from the investors. And so, for us, it gives us, I think, maximum optionality and flexibility when we're really in this growth-driven state today. Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets : And acquisition plans not slowing down? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think we \u2013 Brett, we continue to explore non-organic growth opportunities that will provide strong share return. And so, that continues. Brett Levy - Loop Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed with the questions. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, Mark and Theresa. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Maybe just a follow-up on that last one. So, I know you've talked in the past about looking for targets that would help you build the mills. But when you go and look for things like Vulcan, what are some of the parameters that you look for as far as profitability, EBITDA margins? What multiples are you kind of willing to pay to get that EBITDA, pre-synergy, post-synergy, just to kind of help us think about what M&A means for valuation, going forward? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I should say we're continuing to evaluate. And we'll evaluate not only inorganic, but I don't think one should forget the organic opportunities that we have. We have about 400,000 tons to 500,000 tons of hot mill excess at Structural Rail division at Columbus city. That will be a very, very effective use of CapEx for $200 million or so. You pick up some tremendous value, tremendous volume there. I'm also working at Roanoke to further utilize its mill and its cash capability. But on the M&A front, obviously, we're looking at opportunities that leverage our core strengths. We want sustainability of quality returns, returns that can appreciate our existing margins. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Evan, from the perspective of valuation, obviously, we don't want to be too specific. But I think Vulcan is an example of something where we've been able because of the management team and different things sometimes to be able to elicit really great value. And so, Vulcan was about a five times multiple, which I think is extraordinary. I know it might seem like it's on the smaller side, but that's an example. If you remember going all the way back to Columbus, Columbus was actually less than a six multiple. So I think that kind of gives you a track record for how management feels about valuation. And regarding your question on EBITDA margins, we're really looking to drive that high, as high as we can. And so, we are \u2013 excuse me, so we would look toward being higher than our average EBITDA margins today but, more importantly, higher than what we've seen in the historical past so that through cycle we can maybe need some of the volatility. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Super-helpful. Thanks. And maybe just one quick follow-up, since I think most are doing that. On the engineered bar front, you mentioned the demand was a bit weak. Could you provide any color there on which end markets are driving there? And I assume it's energy. But we were to see a recovery in the Engineered Bar business. What sort of end markets should we be focused on? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, engineered bar is quite a diversified mill, in all honesty. I'm probably going to get these specific percentages wrong. But energy has been around 15% \u2013 20% in the past. So that, obviously, is very, very challenged. You've got about the same going into the automotive now, which remains strong. Off-road equipment, mining equipment, the Caterpillars, the John Deeres, those folks, probably 30% or so. So that has been kind of weak for sure. And I think the more recent downturn or softening there has been the Class A truck and trailer. First, the Class A trucks, earlier this year, turned down and then the trailer just the last couple of months, in all honesty. So the Eatons of the world are not necessarily buying as much as they did. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Super-helpful, again. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please, proceed with your questions. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Good morning. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Timna. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So I just have a couple. So, as you pointed out, things have softened a little bit. And I just wanted to take on how much that might be a seasonal phenomenon. And you mentioned that, historically, we've seen times where everybody sits on the sidelines and have to rush in because inventories get too low. But we've also seen historically, as you know, gaps between us and the rest of the world not get this wide. So I just wanted a little bit more color on what you're seeing relative to normal seasonality and why we might get to a squeeze rather than see the import responses time around? Thanks. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Firstly, just to be clear, I think, from a market perspective, that, that remains somewhat stable, with the exception of the softening in the trailer industry. I would tell you that the markets are generally as they have been, and construction continues to incrementally grow. So it's not necessarily a structural underlying demand issue. So I don't call it softening per se. The order book, obviously, on the Structural side of the business. Anticipation of scrap pricing changes the mentality or the sentiment of the buyer there. They bought little bit ahead when April and May ticked up. And as I said earlier, we will see somewhat of an impact and, look, it's not massive going into the third quarter for the Long Product shipments. In sheet, there is really no softening at all, in the coated \u2013 coat (42:23). And I would say in hot band, there's a hesitancy. I don't think there's soft \u2013 underlying softness. Folks, they are just holding off to buy exactly what they need right now. They think the market is going to go down and it's, to be honest, anyone's guess. The import market arena, as I suggested, the kind of the activity, the enquiries, and the chatter has definitely picked up a little. Pricing is remaining quite resilient. And for $50 a ton, people aren't going to get overly, overly excited. You'll see some pickup probably in volume, but it's not going to get, I do believe, to the levels that created our past problems over 2015. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just if you could remind us, as a follow-up, on your cash usage, if maybe Theresa could you give us any updated thoughts on priorities for use of cash. I mean, are there a lot of available additional value-added processors that fit your business model that may be attractive? Or do you think that you'd be more skewed toward higher dividend and buybacks at this time? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would say that \u2013 again, just to repeat what I said earlier, we're just continuing to explore non-organic growth opportunities in the M&A field, with the focus, obviously, on providing strong shareholder return. Well, that's our primary focus right now. We obviously always evaluate other shareholder sort of value return mechanisms that you can get through sort of the capital structure, dividends or share buybacks. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning, Mark, and congratulations on the quarter. A question... Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Michael. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Last quarter and the first quarter, you had indicated that you were selling a fair amount of hot rolled to the integrated producers. Did you continue that in the second quarter? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think I ever said that, Michael. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I thought in the Q&A, you did. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not so sure. I suggest that we sold \u2013 I'd have to re-read my transcript. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Did you sell hot rolled to the integrated producers in the second quarter? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that it's probably a question that's going to go unanswered, Michael. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Then let me give you another question then. When you look at your sheet market, do you think about like what is the new normal in terms of the sheet market dynamics, when you basically eliminate China from the U.S. market with the tariffs that have been put in place on cold rolled and coated, and then the 90% tariffs that have been in place for 15 years now on hot rolled. You eliminate basically a producer that produces over half of the world's sheet products in the U.S. market. Can you kind of discuss what the kind of new normal is or implications on spreads or whatever you'd like to talk about in terms of evaluating the new market conditions? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm not so sure, I or we are any smarter than anyone else. Obviously, the elimination of China has buoyed the market currently. I do think that the coated and cold rolled sheet spreads, which are at historical highs, will probably remain so as long as China has shut out. As long as the trade cases are in place to impede, they are not going to eliminate, but they will impede the import pricing. So I think those spreads are not just an aberration. I think they are going to be around for a while. Ultimately, longer term and when I say longer term, years out \u2013 over the years, I think some of that material will somehow look find its way back into the American market either through other converters or through manufactured goods. There is a good portion of imported steel in refrigerators and cars and other things. So, seriously, I'm not smart enough to know long term what the impact is. Obviously, we're in a commodity market. It's a supply and demand equation. You take supply out, it's going to benefit and bode well for the market environment and for pricing and for your profitability profile. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And just by the way, good luck with it. Hope you don't stress out too much about becoming investment grade. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll try not to, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I just wanted to ask maybe about how to think about your acquisitions, particularly the one that you just did with Vulcan, you mentioned that they were already a large consumer of your product and it would seem that you're kind of forward integrating into owning what used to be a client. Is that a way that we could think about some of your future M&A where you want to kind of go more downstream in terms of owning some of your potential current clients? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Downstream is definitely a focus, yes. I think we're in a cyclical business and in times of sort of depressed or recessed markets, having pulled through volume or low \u2013 greater utilization of our mills, which are the capital intensive assets in our portfolio. New Millennium platform obviously has done that well in the past and will continue to do so in the future, and it would be nice for us to get good assets that support or pair our core competencies, but we're not going to go out on a limb and buy something we don't know. As Barry said, I think when we toured Vulcan last, there's absolutely nothing here that we don't know. And in fact, our incentive systems, our culture can \u2013 I do believe lower cost increase their productivity and efficiencies and obviously give them even better profitably profile. But bottom line, yes, we are looking \u2013 one of our focuses is to look downstream at high-margin, pull-through volume-type assets. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And my second question was just, how should we think about with the new paint line coming on in Q1 2017? You said that that cost was $100 million of CapEx. How should we think about the incremental EBIT or EBITDA bump that you would get from that kind of investment? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think just to calibrate, I guess, we would look at the payback with today's margins within 24 months. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your questions. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Phil. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, Theresa, just curious if you could remind us of the lag in flat roll pricing. I know you had given some clues as to the fact that the long products pricing was relatively flattish. So the hot rolled band price probably was up something less than $100 and we know the market is up clearly a lot more than that. Should we think about the difference between current market pricing and then maybe what was realized off the bottom as likely to be the type of pricing that you're going to be realizing in the third quarter? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Phil, first of all, over the Flat Roll Group, about 60% of the overall volume is spot. And so that trades as the spot market trades. If you think about the other 40%, most of that is tied to CRU in some form or fashion, and CRU already lags about four weeks, and our contracts lag another two months probably. Barry Schneider - Senior Vice President-Flat Roll Steel Group : Up to two months. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Up to two months. So you're looking at potentially two months to a quarter worth of lag over that 40%. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. So I think that still insinuates with your lead times on hot rolled or at least what they were a couple of months ago that you're still sort of catching up to where the market is now relative to where we were in the second quarter in terms of what you realized. Mark, if, let's say lead times, which have come in a little bit on hot rolled, persist for a little bit longer and let's say the service centers are able to take another 10% out of inventory, do you choose to do maintenance activity or do you choose to still run as aggressively as you did in the second quarter and try to maintain that share that you have? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, Phil, as we've said in the past, it's a balance. You've got to be careful taking one's price down in search of an order and just get 500 tons and you find it takes the whole price of the market there, right? The second, I don't think there are lot of orders to be achieved. And I think the market will remain firm. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think, Phil, your question was around maintenance, and whether we're taking maintenance or not. And so related to that, I'd just remind you that we mentioned it that Columbus facility actually will be taking one of the galv lines down for a bit of time, because they want to put in \u2013 it's part of the paint line investment itself, and so that's probably going to impact some volume in the third quarter and we're kind of estimating that to be around a $5 million impact. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Columbus will have its maintenance shutdown in the third quarter as well. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: (54:37) for Butler. Is that third quarter or November? Christopher Graham - Senior Vice President, Downstream Manufacturing Group : Right now we're leaning towards fourth quarter \u2013 more into the fourth quarter for the Butler outage. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Perfect. And Theresa, can you provide the mix on the flat roll side as you typically do? And then I'll hop off. Thanks so much. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Sorry, Phil. I'm glad you did that. Second quarter flat roll shipments across the Flat Roll Group, hot rolled and P&O combined was 872,000 tons; cold rolled was 166,000 tons; and coated, which will include painted, galvanized and Galvalume, was 750,000 tons. Philip N. Gibbs - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Thanks. Our next question comes from the line of Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie. Please proceed with your questions. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi. Thank you and good morning. I wonder if you could talk about scrap for a moment, Mark and Theresa. The market for scrap seems to be weakening a little bit maybe due to China slowing or the dollar or whatever it could be. I am just wondering in your network of scrap collection as well as processing, can you lower your intake prices at this time as fast as the scrap price declines without losing volume or how is that balance going these days? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Hey, Aldo, this is Russ. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hey, Russ. Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Thanks for the question. Again I think certainly we can lower the buy price, but it does impact the flows, particularly of obsoletes. I think as you look at the outlook and I think Mark's got it nailed spot on, I think we're soft sideways in the near-term future. The strength of the U.S. dollar has again slowed exports, but more importantly than that it's also encouraged some imports, because you get the cargoes out of Britain in particular that are much more affordable in today's dollar terms. So, that import/export balance there, I think, will continue to keep a lid on any major pricing moves, particularly on the upside. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Certainly, I think there will be a little bit of downward pressure, but again I think we're going to trade in a range probably for the rest of the year. If I look at it right now, I think we're going to be in a very narrow range for the rest of the year. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Right. And Russ, as the company looks to grow, they mentioned \u2013 you mentioned through acquisitions, maybe you're looking at downstream businesses. Would any of your scrap assets, maybe some shredders, be available for sale, do you think, at some point? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Well, I think, Aldo, we look at everything that comes at us regardless whether it makes sense to us or not, but I think our intent is to be strategic particularly to make sure we're supporting the steel mills of our company. That's the key factor that we get as a group. So, again, we look at anything and everything whether it's buy, sell or repurpose. Aldo Mazzaferro - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Congratulations on the progress. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Alessandro Abate with Berenberg. Please proceed with your questions. Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Mark and Theresa, good morning. It's Alessandro Abate from Berenberg. My question is related to your strategy for Columbus, specific to Mexico. And just going back to what you just said the target seems to be 500,000 tons to the automotive. Can you just give a little bit more color related to how much of these targets coming from Mexico and how much from the U.S. and whether there is an investment of $10 million (58:38) in the galvanizing line and Nucor or GEC can actually represent kind of potential threat to your target or your target is already taken in consideration the future development? Thank you. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think their expansions will threaten our plans, to be honest. Much of the automotive work we've got today is actually in the Southern U.S. So if you think we've got 180,000 tons this year and we got another 180,000 tons next year, we're quite well on our way again to our target even without Mexico. Obviously, Mexico is sort of boomtown for steel consumption, both on the appliance, HVAC, automotive side and there is no doubt that we will get some warning down there. A lot of our existing customers have facilities or building facilities or partnering with folks in Monterrey and the Mexican City arena. But currently, most of our output is within America. Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): And Mike, thanks for the answer, but is it possible to really give more color on the potential sales volume you might be getting from Mexico, let's say, in the next two years to three years? Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Barry? Barry Schneider - Senior Vice President-Flat Roll Steel Group : Well, I believe in the painting products, we do see some growth opportunities in the Mexican markets through existing customers that we have relationships here in the United States. So we do see the painted products going down into their both appliance and construction-type products, as Mark mentioned, some of the automotive where we will envision down there as well as some general \u2013 just general service center-type applications, so I do think there is a reason to expect that we will be somewhere above 200,000 tons into that marketplace in the next couple of years, but we're not limiting what we do. We have very good freight access to the area and we have developed a Mexican strategy that will purpose all of our platforms together. Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Thanks. Just a little follow-up. Out of these couple of hundred thousand tons of shipment, could you also give me a split between HVAC and automotive? Barry Schneider - Senior Vice President-Flat Roll Steel Group : That would be very difficult at this point. Alessandro Abate - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning, Mark and Theresa. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I think I have a question about again in terms of scrap pricing and it's more of a dynamic of domestic versus international. Can you talk a little bit about what you've been seeing in the market? Have you been seeing Turkey import scrap out of the U.S.? Have you been seeing the scrap come over from Turkey? How the flow has been and how is kind of the state of the market with respect to that? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Sean, This is Russ. I think Turkey continues to be in and out of the market, as they balance off the billet cost or the slab cost against what it takes to get scrap. Again with the events in Turkey last weekend, I'm not sure what the Turks are going to be doing in the next \u2013 at least the next two weeks or three weeks. So I would anticipate that that's going to be \u2013 well, it's going to be a tough question to answer. The bulk of the scrap that has been imported in the U.S. today is generally of the higher grade scraps that is coming from Europe, again based on the strength of the U.S. dollar. So I think those are same \u2013 those are similar types of origins of scrap that the Turks have access to as well, so if it makes sense for the U.S., it more than likely makes sense for the Turks as well. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And have you seen that \u2013 how has that trended this year? Have you seen that increase or decrease over time into the last couple of months? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Sean, are you talking about imported scrap? Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, please. Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : I think I read an article just a week or so ago, but the volumes in the south of \u2013 Southern U.S. and based on everything that I gathered out of that article, it looked to me like the amount of imports in the first half of 2016 are already more than the entire 2015 level of imports. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then has a lot of that been \u2013 a lot of that hasn't been offset by exports, right, because the dollar has been strong. So nobody can buy our scrap?. Is that the right way to think about it? Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : That's the ample supply of scrap in the United States. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Russell B. Rinn - Executive Vice President of Metals Recycling; President and Chief Operating Officer of OmniSource Corporation : Via imports and via lack of exports. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Hey, thank you very much, Russ. I appreciate it. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. And I think it'd be our position that given the economic turmoil and the fact that the U.S. economy is strong that most of that dollar strength will remain for some time to come. And so, that will just continue to dampen the export market and encourage import. Sean M. Wondrack - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T. Please proceed with your question. Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets : Hi. Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but just wondering whether your full-year CapEx guidance has changed at all since the April call? Theresa E. Wagler - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The full-year guidance right now is $225 million, and obviously that's pretty much back loaded to the second half of the year. This really primarily relates to the expected payment stream to support the Columbus (01:04:50) paint line. Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets : Great. Thanks a lot, Theresa. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark D. Millett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Super, Brenda. Well, just quickly, thank you for your support. I think we are uniquely positioned for growth, and we'll take advantage of the opportunities that come our way. I was supported by a phenomenal group of employees and a phenomenal group of customers. So we are in a great shape. We are excited, so from Russ, from Barry, from Chris, from Glenn, and Theresa and I, thank you for your time today. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

I would appreciate you sharing your time with us today, and I hope everyone has enjoyed the summer. It seems hard to believe we\u2019re already headed into the home stretch for 2016.  We recognize you all have a busy day today, so we\u2019re going to keep our prepared remarks a little briefer than normal. But I do want to take a moment to welcome our newest team from Vulcan Threaded Products to SDI family. We completed the acquisition in August and integration is going very, very well. We're excited to have everyone aboard and look forward to growing our futures together.  I'd also like to thank the whole SDI team for an incredible job in producing an excellent quarter -- this past quarter. And I think when earnings season is complete it will show their effort has once again driven a best-in-class performance relative to our peers in the industry. So again, phenomenal job guys and girls. But to begin this morning, I have Theresa to comment on the financial perspectives of our third quarter performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Excluding the litigation settlement charge of $4.6 million, third quarter 2016 net income was $160 million or $0.65 per diluted share. On an adjusted GAAP basis, net income was $157 million or $0.64 per diluted share, both within our guidance range of between $0.63 and $0.67. On additional note : the Vulcan integration is going very well and the transaction was accretive to our third quarter results despite the $2 million non-cash purchase accounting charge.  Despite lower volumes across the operating platforms, third quarter 2016 revenues of $2.1 billion were slightly higher than sequential second quarter sales as realized flat roll prices increased over 20% and sequential long product pricing also improved, although to a much lesser extent.  Our third quarter 2016 gross margin was steady at 19% driven by the performance of our steel operations in an increasingly challenging environment. As a result, our operating income for the third quarter was $284 million compared to second quarter results of $256 million, an 11% improvement.  For the third quarter 2016, steel shipments decreased 9% to 2.3 million tons. Volumes declined across all divisions but most notably at our Columbus Flat Roll Division which was partially attributable to both a planned galvanized outage to install Galvalume equipment and to an unplanned maintenance outage in late September. Additionally, late in the quarter customers were hesitant to make purchases ahead of anticipated scrap price decreases.  Third quarter 2016 steel platform average selling values increased $100 per ton to $740, outpacing increased average scrap cost of $24 per ton. Improved steel mill spread more than offset lower shipments resulting in operating income from our steel operations of $311 million, a 13% improvement over sequential quarter results, another strong performance.  The operating environment for our mill recycling platform continues to be challenging. Third quarter 2016 platform operating income was $10 million compared to $15 million in the sequential second quarter. Lower domestic steel mill utilization resulted in decreased ferrous scrap demand and an 8% decline in shipments, although metal spread remained steady.  Ferrous shipments to our steel mills represented 62% of total metals recycling third quarter volume as we continued to effectively lever the strength of our vertically integrated business profile. Non-residential construction demand continues to be steady throughout much of the United States although the recent severe weather on the East Coast has slowed projects in that region. We continue to see strong quote and order entry activity as we head into the seasonally slower winter timeframe. Third quarter 2016 fabrication shipments were consistent with the sequential second quarter. However as we suggested on last quarter's call, metals spread compressed as the inventory stream contained higher priced flat rolled steel which more than offset the 4% improvement in fabrication average selling values. As a result, third quarter 2016 operating income from our fabrication operations was $18 million, a decrease of $6 million when compared to the sequential second quarter.  During the third quarter we generated another strong cash flow from operations result of $196 million. For the first three months of 2016 we generated $643 million of cash from operations with very flat working capital levels. Our business model generates strong cash flows through varying market cycles based on the low highly variable cost structure of our operations and our diversified value-added product offerings.  We maintained a record liquidity of $2.2 billion at September 30, 2016, comprised of our undrawn revolver and available cash of $1.1 billion. Our third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA was $359 million and trailing twelve months with over $1 billion resulting in net leverage of 1.5 times which is down considerably from 2.7 times at the end of 2015. Our credit profile continues to be solidly aligned with our preferred through cycle net leverage of less than 3 times with considerable room for growth, a testament to our disciplined approach to growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet.  Our debt maturity outlook continues to provide great optionality having no meaningful maturities until 2019 but in the interim periods having ample call provision flexibility. Looking forward we continue to believe that our capital structure and credit profile have the strength and flexibility to sustain current operations and support strategic growth, both organic and inorganic. We maintained our cash dividend in the quarter of $0.14 per common share. Our history of sustained and increasing cash dividend demonstrates the confidence that we and our board of directors have in the strength and consistency of our cash generation capability, financial position and optimism looking towards to the future. Based on this confidence, the board authorized up to a $450 million share repurchase program to complement our dividend and growth strategy as a vehicle to return additional capital to shareholders. This represents over 7% of our current market cap. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation capacity allows us the flexibility to initiate this program while maintaining our strong focus toward organic and inorganic strategic growth. We intend to not only use our existing cash and free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our shares from time to time. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price and other shareholder value enhancing opportunities. Absent large strategic opportunities or a materially negative change in market conditions, we would anticipate possibly completing the program in the coming 18 to 24 months. This program in no way changes our focus for growth. It simply offers us another tool to consider when allocating capital to optimize value creation.  Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Super, thanks Theresa. As in the past calls, I want to reiterate that the safety and welfare of our employees remains our number one priority. Nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe working environment. Our safety performance remains better than industry averages and we continue to work toward a zero incident environment at every location.  We've reduced our total recordable injury rate by 14% so far this year and 64% of our locations are incident free. We are on pace for another record year and my sincere thanks go to the entire SDI family for their dedication and continued focus on our most important priority.  The steel platform performed well in the third quarter in spite of lower shipments. The divisions, especially the flat roll group achieved meaningful metal spread expansion as increased average product pricing outpaced higher scrap costs. Additionally, due to our diversified value added product offerings, our third quarter steel production utilization was 85% compared to the domestic steel industry operating rate which decreased to about 69%, 70%.  2016 has certainly provided a changing landscape to the domestic steel market. Demand from the automotive and construction sectors remains positive. But demand relative to heavy equipment, agriculture and energy while not deteriorating further is still anemic. Specific to flat roll, year-over-year imports have declined while customer inventory remains lower than historical levels. Longer demand outlook is relatively unchanged but late in the third quarter customers were hesitant to make purchases ahead of expected scrap price declines. And as a result, steel shipments were lower than anticipated, especially for hot rolled coil. Despite this, our flat roll production utilization rate was at 97% as the Butler flat roll division continued to operate above estimated production capacity.  Conversely, third quarter 2016 production utilization for our long products group declined 66% with engineered bar being the most challenged. Even though our SBQ expansion into smaller diameter bars has significantly helped utilization this year, because this size is generally tied to the automotive sector which has been strong, operating rates are still far less than we would like. The competitive landscape for engineered bar, structural steel and merchant shapes remains extremely aggressive.  Part of the investment thesis for the Vulcan acquisition is the potential volume improvement opportunity that brings to our engineered bar division. Historically Vulcan has purchased nearly 20,000 tons of steel bars from us annually. Based on our actual current production capabilities we can actually supply up to 50,000 tons to Vulcan which is under 10% of our engineered bar division\u2019s 2015 shipments. Vulcan purchases special bar quality steel products for the manufacture and sale of higher margin threaded steel rod, cold finished bar and heat treated bar. Integration is progressing smoothly and there are opportunities for further synergies between the two divisions heading into 2017. At Columbus, the successful market and product diversification that has been achieved over the last eighteen months is one of the key differentiators for the improved profitability that we are realizing this year. Columbus has been producing at historically record rates and continues to increase the value added product capabilities. The paint line division is on budget and on schedule with expectations for painted product shipments to begin in the first quarter of 2017.  The $100 million investment will provide 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and further diversification into higher margin products for Columbus. We have two existing paint lines in Indiana. But this new line allows for high quality double wide steel and access to the southern U.S. and Mexican markets. We plan to sell surface-critical appliance-grade steel as well as construction related products.  I want to congratulate the Columbus team on already successfully installing the Galvalume coating equipment and shipping their first value add Galvalume coils in August. However the required downtime associated with this addition resulted in about 25,000 tons of lost shipments in the quarter. Our steel platform also continues to benefit from other organic growth investments, such as our premium rail and SBQ expansion as well as the $22 million investment for an additional 600,000 tons of annual flat roll pickling capability at our Butler flat roll division that started in January of this year. The addition increases value add sales while the de-emphasizing commodity grade hot rolled. More recently we also approved a $15 million investment to increase annual galvanizing productivity by as much as 180,000 tons at the Butler division. We anticipate completion of the project in the second quarter of 2017. We also plan to invest $28 million at our Roanoke bar division to utilize excess melting and casting capability by adding equipment that will allow you for multistrand threading and finishing the rebar. With a highly competitive cost structure we expect to grow strong market penetration in this product with conflict free supply to independent rebar fabricators. Operations are expected to begin 2018.  The team is still working on a solution to utilize the excess melting and casting capacity at the structural rail division of about 450,000 to 500,000 tons. We anticipate announcing a project early next year. The profitability of our metals recycling platform declined in the quarter, even though scrap metal spreads were relatively stable, as reduced domestic steel mill utilization resulted in weaker demand. The recycling environment remains challenging. Many regional players in the industry are either for sale or headed into insolvency. And as such the number of active shredders has declined which should benefit the industry in the years ahead. Looking forward we expect the pricing environment to continue to stabilize. We will likely see some price support through the rest of the year as we move into a period of seasonally lower obsolete scrap flows. We saw this dynamic when October\u2019s pricing was down about $30 for prime grades but down only $10 to $20 for obsolete grades. With the expectation of a continued strong US dollar and a relatively low scrap export level, we anticipate ample scrap supply and don't see likely drivers for significant increases in ferrous scrap prices in the months ahead. The fabrication platform continues their ongoing historically strong performance. Since our acquisition of additional deck assets in September of 2015 we have gained considerable market share for deck achieving approximately 30% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to only 24% in the same timeframe last year. Additionally, the acquisition provides an opportunity for steel supply options for our Columbus flat roll division. Over the last three years the acquired assets averaged 60,000 tons of annual flat roll steel purchases, predominantly from our competitors and predominantly a galvanized product. With sourcing a substantial amount of the steel now from Columbus which have us further shift Columbus\u2019 product mix and increase mill utilization, the power of pull-through volume was certainly helpful in the last year's steel market environment. Our fabrication operations which is just over 300,000 tons of steel from our steel mills in 2015 and we have already purchased over $245,000 tons this year. The new millennium team continues to perform well, levering our national footprint, the strength those business provides positive insight into the continued strength the non-residential construction activity. We continue to see steady order activity and anticipate lower fourth quarter volumes due to seasonality.  Relative to the macro environment the steel consuming sectors that were weak in 2015 and into the first half of \u201916 such as energy, heavy equipment and agriculture remains so but are not deteriorating further. And those sectors that are in strong or recovering are continuing in this path such as automotive and construction. Reduced imports, idling of domestic capacity and relatively higher global pricing coupled with steady demand and rebalanced supply chain inventory have created a year-over-year improved environment for flat roll products. Just recently there certainly has been some mixed signals within the flat roll arena, especially related to hot rolled. Hot rolled selling values have seen significant downward pressure. Additionally we are heading into a seasonally lower demand environment with customers headed into significantly increasing inventories before the end of the year. Due to these factors we anticipate lower sequential volumes in our operating platforms which is a seasonally typical for the calendar fourth quarter coupled with sequentially weaker realized fuel pricing. We have a constructive view on directional 2017 steel consumption. Domestic automotive production may be coming off record levels but we believe total 2017 NAFTA automotive steel consumption will be steady as Mexico grows production, which is complementary to the strategy of our Columbus flat roll division. We believe there will be additional growth in the construction sector especially for the larger public sector infrastructure projects which will greatly benefit our long products group. We can also see some improved activity on the slides within the energy sector next year. Going forward we\u2019ll also continue to focus on adding value products to our portfolio that helped insulate ourselves from imports and create long lasting customers partnerships. Through broad product diversification to manufacturing value added products that are more difficult to compete with on a global basis such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ and along the line trail we\u2019re able to maintain higher steel mill utilization rates than our peers. Our business build model will continue to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and the execution of a long term strategy. We also have additional company specific innings catalysts and are well positioned for growth. Customer focus coupled with our market diversification and low cost operating platforms will support her ability to maintain our best in class industry performance.  In addition to the value creation there are ripe for strategic growth and growth will clearly remain our first focus. We are pleased that our board authorized a new share repurchase program based on our strong balance sheet and can see in free cash flow generation. This authorization, I believe, underscores the confidence management and the board have in our strategy and our ability to continue to invest in our business and drive long term profitability while returning capital to shareholders. The foundation of our success is undoubtedly the strong character and determination of our employees which I believe are unmatched in our industry. They are phenomenal group and I'm proud to stand with them. We look forward to creating new opportunities for them along with our customers and our shareholders in the months and years ahead.  So again sincerely thank you for your time today and Doug would please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Evan Kurtz : So my one question will be on your internal growth strategy, so it sounds like you're headed for kind of the low 300,000 level on shipments to your own downstream. I am just trying to get a sense of what inning we\u2019re in here. If you kind of look out five years or so what do you think that number will be? Are there lot of opportunities out there for reasonably priced downstream operations that can kind of feed off of maybe Pittsboro or Columbia City? Mark Millett : Evan, I believe there are numerous options. We've actually had a very very very busy summer reviewing those options. We're very very disciplined though, we want to make sure that any opportunity conforms to our culture, conforms to the fact that we can bring that culture to leverage better performance, making sure that there is diversification and making sure that it really differentiates ourselves or we\u2019re going into business businesses where we differentiate ourselves from who of that competitor might be. I would say in general, and there's no algorithm or formula. But as a gut feel we\u2019re aiming for roughly 20% of our total capabilities, so that\u2019s probably a couple million tons. The new millennium billing systems, they pushed about 600,000 tons of product in total. If we wanted to, they could have bought a lot more this past year. But as you know in the second and third quarters, our steel mills have better options to the sell that product at higher margin. To others, while new millennium, they were to take advantage of lower sort of commodity prices that some of our competition were offering. So I think the model is a very valid one. Because again as steel pricing did come down this year, the lowest new millennium raw material input cost and their earnings, so having that pull-through volume allows us to head through the market, insulate us a little bit from -- help mitigate a little bit the cyclicality of our business. And it will be a focus for us going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays Bank. Matthew Korn : Good morning everybody. So let me ask, last quarter you mentioned the expectation that your \u2013 that some long product buyers in looking at the increase in scrap that was pending actually pulled forward a little demand into the second quarter. And that was going to lead into third quarter a little bit of a decline in shipments. Question for you as you think whether or not in the sheet business, you had some of the similar effect now in hindsight where buyers try to get ahead of the price hikes and there right now some of the demand softness is due to the fact that they're sitting fairly ample inventory wise. Mark Millett : Not quite. I think the sheet buyers anticipated further price erosion and I've been sitting on the sidelines of over the last couple months, probably two or three months for that matter. But I do think that we are approaching an inflection point for sure. So the kind of the slight dampening of demand that this suggests I think is principally seasonal. There is obviously a lot of noise out there as to the marketplace and there are some markets that are off. But I would tell you we are strong believers that there are no -- that there is not a structural change in demand, it\u2019s principally seasonal. And that we\u2019re going through the similar cycles we saw last year -- the fourth quarter of last year was pretty well paralleled what we\u2019re seeing today. And that the volatility is driven more by I think procurement decisions, by inventory positioning than any structural change in demand. Matthew Korn : That\u2019s very helpful. Let me follow on that then. You\u2019ve got inventories that are fairly light, got lead times that are short and you got current price that doesn\u2019t really track a lot in the way of imports. Do you think that we're potentially coiled for a pretty sharp rebound in pricing once the buying activity does return and would you think maybe that returning comes more into the new calendar year? Mark Millett : I think we\u2019re certainly at the bottom of the marketplace. And I think there's an inflection point around the corner and whether that is next week or whether it's a month or two, your guess is as good as mine. I would tell you that -- I don't know whether one week makes a market but the order activity and the inquiry activity just in the last week we're going to have is considerable compared to the last two or three months for sure. But if you look at the probability of price direction and an inflection point, there are several -- several factors that in my mind would suggest that the pricing is going to be moving up. The import arbitrage has certainly reversed itself. Import pricing today is very very unattractive. Hot rolled coil Q1 offers are probably 4.60 to 4.80 today, give or take a little bit on a delivered basis. The import light gauge coated products, the spread to domestic product was I think peaked right to 180 bucks, the standard to $100 today it would strengthen Asian market. And customers are starting to see that import deliveries now from the smaller countries where both have to pick up coils from different ports and deliver them to different ports, there is a certain unreliability there that, that\u2019s creeping in. But there's no doubt that the import scenario is changing dramatically. And I think Russ would tell you that scrap prices has as likely reached the floor. So that's the eliminating that resistance to ordering steel due to any anticipation of falling scrap prices so that's beyond us. And I think scrap is somewhat at parity and with the Chinese billet conversion for Turkey. So that's probably going forward kind of a flat up a little type pricing environment and so there's no incentive for folks that hold off or in today from the raw material perspective. As you said supply side inventories are at very low levels and some may look at the fact well it's on a shipment rate basis two point four two point five months when I set a pretty low shipment basis. When the tide turns that suddenly is a very tight position for the rich folks to the end.  And then the raw material cost structure of the integrated mills, coke has gone orbital, doubled or more than double in the last few months. That's putting pressure -- pricing pressure on the integrated mills. Again three cases are going to remain in effect and limited in the import levels as well. And one other kind of side note, the speculators that tend to take large positions and they're the ones that tend to draw all the market pricing down in a trough like period that we're in today. Most of those folks have taken those positions. And so I think the pressure is off. So you have a model multifaceted kind premise that we\u2019re nearing an inflection point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alessandro Abate with Joh. Berenberg. Alessandro Abate : Good morning, Mark and Theresa. My question is related to Columbus. It\u2019s a kind of double question because you mentioned you might be seeing some recovery in the energy segments. So I was wondering considering the exposure of Columbus to the energy market, in terms of a potential upside on margin what are you going to be able to quantify in terms of expectation? And the second one of course is a follow up, considering the significant investment in the money [ph] market in Mexico, I was wondering whether you were planning a potential step into the market and think kind of activity light, for example, your competitors are doing at the moment? Thank you much. Mark Millett : Well, I think from a energy recovery perspective I'm not sure that we are doing cartwheels that the volumes are going to be dramatically higher in the first half of 2017. I think energy prices are up which is supporting a little more activity on the rig side, OCTG inventories are drawn down. I think there's still four five six months, so it\u2019s still pretty considerable. But it is a I think an indication that the energy market is certainly bottomed, there's some glimmer of activity there. I think even in our engineered bar products division those folks are seeing a couple of pockets of order activity. So it's just going to be I think a slow but sort of positive momentum. Barry, would you agree with that? Barry Schneider : Absolutely, agree and I would add that in some cases we're developing more products to service that market at Columbus. So some of it is just being able to make newer products that are being asked for. Mark Millett : And then to your second question on Mexico. Obviously that is an incredibly -- well it's boom time for steel. And a couple weeks ago I spent some time down there and even though you read about it and you hear about it and you study it, the growth there is it's unimaginable. And it's also -- well most of it is steel consumer. We're in an incredibly good position with the Columbus acquisition, those folks from the KCS line. So they have a direct access down through the spine of Mexico, from Monroe, some fuel, and I can't pronounce these names San Luis Potosi --But nonetheless we have a great great logistics avenue to penetrate that market.  The recycling platform actually has been developing quite well down there and we have about 240 million to 250,000 tons of material that we\u2019re responsible for sort of processing and distributing and selling to the U.S. Automotive companies, Ford Chrysler, the stampers as they move down. They want us to continue to use to service them in that environment because we are a sort of a public company, someone they know and that they trust, so that business has developed quite well. On the steel side, I think Barry, we're going to sell 180,000, 200,000 tons of product into Mexico this year. Our aim is to move that up to somewhere between 400,000 to 500,000 tons. The advent of our pain line coming online in the first quarter will certainly help and facilitate that bombing. But we're well on a way there or already. Christopher Graham : I was just going to add, because I had some earlier calls but Columbus but fair and entertainment, and they have done to change that. I think the word exposure to energy is maybe a misnomer these days. We have an opportunity as energy recovers to leverage our capabilities but we are by no means dependent on that as the diversification has happened over last year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : Hi, I just had a quick question regarding the near term outlook. We did get some results out of one of the I think the biggest service center this morning and I believe they're guiding shipments down, close to 6% to 7%. And I am wondering if that's consistent with what you're seeing with regard to your order books on a short term basis in terms of order of magnitude and is that a reasonable range to assume on volumes for you for fourth quarter? Thanks. Theresa Wagler : David, we tend to try not to give expectations even near term going out. We did mention the fact that we are expecting lower volumes actually across the platforms as well, primarily because of seasonality. And so yeah, we\u2019ll see a reduction, I'm not sure that it will be in the same magnitude but it will be meaningful probably compared to third quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Thanks, Mark and Theresa and good morning. You mentioned on the call that you have some confidence in demand for infrastructure steel next year coming from large public sector projects. Could you elaborate a little bit on what indications or data is giving you that confidence? Thanks. Theresa Wagler : I would just comment, part of the optimism is coming from the advent of the highway bill and conversations, that if you\u2019ve paid attention to some of the states that actually committed significant dollars to these infrastructure type projects. However given the election year it's really not dependent upon who may win the election but it's just trying to understand which administration will be in place. And so there has been some pullback and the expectation is that that construction will start in 2017. So we believe that there could be some pent-up type of construction projects available coming into the first half of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Loop Capital Markets. Brett Levy : As you \u2013 thanks for taking my question, Mark and Theresa. As you guys look to continue to be a growth stock and grow through either organic or acquisitions, I'm just wondering where do you look next? I mean I think most of the big things are either bought or controlled by somebody else. You might look at Mexico, you might look at other things like Vulcan further downstream or the paint line. But you know as your EBITDA to interest or adjusted EBITDA to interest is now over 10 times. And you're looking at some call dates coming up, is it possible you\u2019ll look to the investment grade? So I guess it\u2019s a two part question. One is what areas do you look to buy geographically and business sector wise and then also sort of the potential move to investment grade. You're very close already now. Mark Millett : As you said we\u2019re very focused on downstream value added type opportunities that would perhaps have higher margin or better quality margin as I\u2019d like to call it and gain that pull-through volume. And I think there remains -- we've looked at a lot of them this summer and discounted them. Again I think we\u2019ve hopefully demonstrated that our acquisition and inorganic growth strategy is very disciplined. We\u2019re not going to be emotional and outbid someone just to get it and pay an exorbitant number. Nor are we going to grow just for growth sake. We're going to be very very very patient.  Relative to investment grade I would suggest that we will eventually get there. We're not looking to sort of engineer that in the near term. Theresa Wagler : Brett, I would just add from IG comment is that if you look at where our notes are trading today we\u2019re basically only about maybe 15 to 20 basis points wide of investment grade, until we would like to retain the flexibility and optionality that being in the position we're in today affords us for growth. And then to Mark's point eventually we\u2019ll just get to IG on our own but for right now I think we're well positioned. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth from Credit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : Hi good morning. Mark and Theresa, I had a question just more technically looking at your conversion cost performance in the mill segment this quarter. I mean I understand that sequentially you would see unit level cost increase and a lower volume. The way we derive the total conversion just by taking total COGS less the implied scrap buy, it looked like the aggregate amount of spend was up about 8% sequentially. Yet your volumes were down 9% which is pretty rare looking back historically to see that type of divergence. I am just curious, what drove that, was that energy, the cost of share and can you give any sort of color on how you see conversion costs trending into the fourth quarter? Barry Schneider : From the flat roll side of the business, the Columbus operations went through a pretty significant regular maintenance outage in the third quarter. So the additional costs you see in conversion have to do with some of that \u2013 some of the bigger jobs that we took the opportunity to get behind us. They all went well but some of those jobs are expensive. So that's the Columbus side of the business. Theresa Wagler : And I would say heading into the fourth quarter it really will depend upon obviously volumes but I think from a one-off perspective we won\u2019t have more significant items such as the Columbus outage. Barry Schneider : Absolutely. We do have an outage that we did fourth quarter here in Butler but less costly overall than what we saw at Columbus. Curt Woodworth : Can you quantify the impact of the Columbus outage? Theresa Wagler : We really can\u2019t. I apologize but I just don\u2019t have that information available right at my hands. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners : Good morning everyone. So wouldn\u2019t \u2013 maybe I heard wrong on the comments regarding scrap in the introductory statements there, Mark. But I understand the inflection point on steel and I thought that was quite interesting. But then I thought I heard you say that you didn't see a lot of catalyst for scrap. So can you elaborate on or clarify that position on scrap please? Mark Millett : I already stated my piece. Russ, why don't you weigh in with your in the trenches knowledge. Russell Rinn : Well I think, we\u2019ve seen based on a strong dollar, low mill utilization rates that scrape has fallen in the last three months, we believe is at a bottom and it should flatten out. I think still you\u2019ve got to get the utilization rates to come up. We have seen some activity in export market starting to pick up a little bit which further tells me we reached a bottom point, inflection point on the scrap, that also combined with the fact that you've got potentially winter weather which slows the flows down coming in front of us. So we believe we\u2019re at the bottom on the scrap side, not necessarily anticipating a significant move in the upward pressure but again we also don't see that there's much downside push either. Timna Tanners : And then I wanted to ask a little bit more about the exposure to infrastructure of those services of long products, I always understood that it\u2019s more 15% not as a rail [ph]. So if you could elaborate on your exposure by long product as a percentage and the percent of your overall product mix? Mark Millett : Timna, you were going in and out, I don\u2019t think we had a clear \u2013 Timna Tanners : Sorry about that. So real quick on the exposure to infrastructure, can you provide some sort of gauge of how much you have relative to your overall long products or how much infrastructure exposure you have within your mix? Mark Millett : We had probably around million a half tons or so, maybe 2 million tons of what I\u2019d consider latent capacity or that we just haven't had a market to totally exploit. And most of that is correlated to construction. Timna Tanners : Okay. That would be beams mostly or also some of your sheet, is that what you\u2019re referring to? Mark Millett : That is principally beams, merchant shapes from Roanoke as well. Obviously some of it would be a little bit would be from engineered bar products, but not too much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Phil Gibbs : Got a couple of easy ones and then I\u2019ll pop right off. One for Theresa just on the sheet mix in the quarter and then two from Mark, the galvanized investment in Butler, I believe you said 180,000 tons. Just what -- question basically on that is what are you trying to accomplish, how do you do it and what what's the timeline? Mark Millett : The timeline galvanic expansion is -- Barry Schneider : The equipment\u2019s all been ordered, the products that we sell on the line for the most part we have a great mix of products that are developed. So as we get closer to implementing the \u2013 be through second quarter next year when most of the equipment\u2019s actually being installed. It's also going to allow us to do a lot more housekeeping between the two galvanizing lines at Butler as to what products we specifically run on which line. So for us we do see the ability to add some new customer base there. But we\u2019re really exploring what we want to grow with our existing customer base. Theresa Wagler : I think that will come online in the second half of 2017. Barry Schneider : Second half -- mostly the equipment construction and installation will be first half, mostly second quarter and then third, fourth quarter, we'll start seeing those improved production numbers. Theresa Wagler : And if you think about it, that was a $15 million investment, it\u2019s a very cost effective. And then you wanted the volume, so hot rolled and P&O for the quarter was 770,000 tons, cold rolled was 163,000 tons and coated products were 688,000 tons. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Jorge Beristain : Hi, Mark and Theresa. Mark, I'll help you out with Queretaro in terms of pronunciation. I wanted to just dive more deeply, maybe going back to the met coal situation and just trying to understand, obviously you said it's gone orbital. Our back of the envelope numbers indicate it could be as bad as $100 per ton cost increase to the integrated. So I'm trying to understand if you're concerned that perhaps the integrateds at the margin shift more of their blast furnace mix to scrap and therefore put more upward pressure on scrap prices, or are you more bullish overall that you think that the higher cost base that the integrated will face just means it's setting a new bottom for HRC? Mark Millett : I think the latter. I don't think that the increase in scrap consumption by integrateds is going to make a meaningful impact on the price or the supply demand balance. And so pricing there really is driven more by exports than anything over the last few years and as Russ articulated, we don't see that changing much from the last few months. So not too much pressure there. I think it really does pressure the cost structure of the integrateds. You certainly see the Asian pricing, Chinese pricing going up I think largely because of the increase in coal costs. And I think it sets sort of a nice environment in the US that at some point they're going to have to compensate for that and increase their pricing. So to your last point, yes, I think it's supportive of hot rolled coil. Jorge Beristain : Okay. So it sounds like in 2017 you'd be setting yourselves up for a pretty good environment with flattish scrap, if you believe the integrateds will not pressure demand there, and on the flip side potentially higher HRC for all the reasons you outlined earlier? Mark Millett : Yes. Jorge Beristain : And then on your steel ops, just to dig a bit more deeply on that quarter-over-quarter cost increase, your unit costs were up $71 a ton sequentially. We only saw a $24 per ton sequential increase in scrap. So can we attribute the bulk of that $50 per ton differential to the Columbus regular maintenance outage, or was there anything else in that number? Because you did talk -- I think Theresa mentioned about a normalization and not having that one off again in the fourth quarter. So we just want to understand how much of that was really driven by Columbus. Theresa Wagler : No, I wouldn't suggest that all of that is, because you did have a significant reduction in volume, so 9% reduction in volume does have an impact on conversion costs. So I can't really tell you how much of that was related to Columbus off, I don't have those numbers but it certainly wasn't all of it. Jorge Beristain : But as we look at the \u2013 Barry Schneider : I would say there's also a Columbus \u2013 we acquired scrapyards in the region and right now we are doing quite a bit of housekeeping in those yards to bring those up to where we want them to be. So it's not capital investment right now at this point but we've been bringing those costs in and not exactly seeing the volumes to offset those yet because we're more interested in making sure that the infrastructure there, the process of bringing scrap to the yards, so we're spending more money on those scrap businesses right now that will be offset in the future but it's not really a structural change, it\u2019s just a new cost for Columbus, that\u2019s some of the additional costs we\u2019ve seen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie. Aldo Mazzaferro : Hi, good morning. I wonder if we could just chat a little bit about \u2013 thanks, yeah. Very good. I was wondering if we could chat a little bit about the average selling price you guys had in the quarter. It surprised me in the upside and the metal spreads were wider. And compared to the index, you seem to be catching up. So I'm wondering if you were to say our prices were strong in the third quarter because reasons one, two, three, how would you rank the reasons being if you looked at it between mix, the fact that the mix improved, or the fact that maybe you sold more steel in the early part of the quarter before prices came down a little bit? I'm just trying to get a feel for let's say prices fall in the fourth quarter by $100 a ton, what do you think your prices might do under a scenario like that for flat roll I'm talking? Mark Millett : Good try on the end there, Aldo. But those compound questions are tough to handle. The pricing environment I would say is principally product mix and also we have on the sheet side of the business a reasonable amount of indexed contract which lags and so that helps support our price in a downward price environment. Aldo Mazzaferro : Have you got time for one more, Mark? Mark Millett : Yes. Aldo Mazzaferro : On the stock buyback, you said it depends on market conditions and you're thinking maybe 18 to 24 months. Is that the outside amount of time that you would expect? I'm surprised you're not looking to do it quicker. Mark Millett : Well let\u2019s simply say that we feel that our share prices is dramatically undervalued right now. And I'll just leave it at that. End of Q& A Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. This does conclude our question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : For anyone on the call again thanks for sharing your time with us. We\u2019re fully focused on yourselves, we\u2019re fully focused on our employees and fully focused on our customer base and other constituents. And I just would like to thank everyone for their support of our company and to the employees that may be on the line guys and girls, absolutely phenomenal job this past quarter and for everything you do for us. You do set us apart. We are best in class and we\u2019ll continue to be so. And just be safe in everything you do. Thanks everyone. Operator : Once again ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

We appreciate you sharing your time with us today, and we all wish every one of you health and happiness in this New Year in 2017. I would like to start the call by recognizing and thanking the entire Steel Dynamics\u2019 team for their dedication and strong performance this past year. They did a terrific job further reducing our safety incident rates, turning in best-in-class financial metrics, producing at record rates, and they continue to expand our production capabilities and product offerings. There\u2019s a tangible momentum that continues to build within our Company and within our industry, supported by underlying market fundamentals for 2017 and likely beyond. Coupled with our existing unique earnings catalysts, lean capacity and intended growth objectives, we\u2019re definitely optimistic heading into the year. But to begin this morning, I ask Theresa to comment on our financial results. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I would like to add my thanks and congratulations to the entire SDI team. We have really had a lot of milestones on many fronts this year, and some of those have benefited 2016, but I think many of them have us set up very well for the coming years as well. A few of the items of note are we had record steel shipments this year. We had our third consecutive record year for fabrication shipments and revenues. We had record annual adjusted operating income of $861 million, and we recorded our second highest annual adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion. And I will note that the accounting folks have us just about $10 million shy of our record, so very good year. For the full year 2016, our net adjusted income was $472 million, or $1.92 per diluted share. The adjustments included three items. One was in the third quarter, with litigation settlement charges of about $5 million related to our industry-wide Standard Iron Works lawsuit. The fourth quarter, there was debt refinancing and repayment charges of $17 million associated with the refinancing of our 2019 senior notes and the repayment of our senior secured term note and fourth quarter non-cash asset impairment charges of $132.8 million of which $127 million was related to our Idles of Minnesota iron operation. As we noted in our December 2016 guidance, we evaluated the appropriateness of the carry value of the assets in Minnesota, primarily at the Mining Resources joint venture. These are the operations that produced iron concentrate from tailings that we idled in May of 2014. We determined that the estimated fair value did not support the existing book values, and therefore recorded the impairment. On an unadjusted basis, 2016 GAAP net income was $382 million, or $1.56 per diluted share. Specifically for the fourth quarter, excluding the aforementioned refinancing impairment items, adjusted net income was $106 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, within our adjusted guidance of between $0.40 and $0.44. On an unadjusted basis, fourth quarter 2016 GAAP net income was $20 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2016 consolidated revenue was $1.9 billion, 9% lower than the sequential quarter based on both lower steel shipments and the average selling value. Our adjusted operating income was $189 million, compared to $284 million in the sequential third quarter. The decrease was driven by reduced shipments and metal spread compression within our Flat Roll operations, as average quarterly hot roll prices declined. For steel specifically, the full year was a great year. Our Steel Operations achieved numerous performance milestones, resulting in record volumes and operating income. Notably, full-year flat roll shipments were 14% higher, driving record total shipments of 9.2 million tons. The annual metal spread improved as the annual average scrap raw material costs fell more than average sales prices. Sales prices were down about $17 per ton, where scrap was down $35 per ton. Specifically for the fourth quarter of this year, steel shipments actually decreased 3% to 2.2 million tons. The result of both seasonality and slow flat roll customer order activity early in the quarter. Volumes declined for both flat and long products, although our utilization remained well above the industry. Lower volume in metal spread resulted in a 30% decline in Steel Operating income for the fourth quarter compared to the sequential third quarter. Steel platform average selling prices decreased $60 per ton to $680, outpacing decreased average scrap costs of $31 per ton. Moving to Metals Recycling. This platform had a really steady to improving price environment throughout the year, along with considered focus on operating efficiency resulting in a significant improvement in full-year profitability. Excluding a non-cash $5.5 million goodwill impairment charge, they achieved annual 2016 operating income of $40 million, driven by a 10% improvement in metal spread. Specifically for the fourth quarter of 2016, seasonally slower demand resulted in slightly lower shipments. However, steady metal spread and focused cost efforts resulted in steady sequential operating income of $10 million. Additionally, the team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically integrated business profile benefiting both the steel mills and the scrap operations. Metals Recycling increased the percentage of total of their shipments to Steel Dynamics\u2019 mills from 54% of their volume in 2015 to over 60% in 2016. For Fabrication\u2019s full year 2016, they achieved another strong operating and financial result. Achieving record sales of $704 million on record shipments of 563,000 tons. However, full-year operating income declined just over 20% from the record results of 2015. As noted throughout the year, the decrease was driven by metal spread compression, as higher average steel input costs coincided with lower annual selling values. Specifically for the fourth quarter, Fabrication shipments declined due to seasonal impacts. However, product pricing improved an average of 5%, which more than offset lower shipments and resulted in steady sequential profitability of $18 million. Non-residential construction demand continues to be steady throughout much of the United States. We continue to see strong quote and order entry activity, even considering the seasonally slower winter timeframe. On a consolidated basis, we generated our second strongest year of cash flow from operations in 2016 of $853 million and free cash flow after fixed asset investment of $655 million. Importantly, the quality of the cash flow in 2016 was far superior to last year\u2019s record, as much of 2015 benefited from reduced working capital, while in 2016 it was earnings driven and working capital was effectively managed in a stronger market environment. Even in this seasonally slower fourth quarter, our operating framework allowed us to generate meaningful cash flow from operations of $207 million. Based on favorable market dynamics, we opportunistically refinanced our 6% and 8% $400 million senior notes due 2019 within a new 10-year 5% senior note offering in the same amount. And we repaid $228 million of secured term note debt in the quarter. These transactions are expected to reduce annual 2017 interest burden by about $10 million and further extend our debt maturity profile. We maintained our cash dividend for the fourth quarter at $0.14 per common share, and we repurchased $25 million of our common stock pursuant to the October 2016 Board authorized $450 million program. As demonstrated, our business model and unique operating culture generates strong cash flow through all market cycles, based on the low highly-variable cost structure of our operations and our highly-diversified value-added product offerings. Even after investing in operations, decreasing debt and increasing dividends early in the year while also initiating a share repurchase program, we maintained near-record liquidity of over $2 billion at the end of the year. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with a strong credit and capital structure profile provides great opportunity for continued organic and inorganic growth. We are squarely focused on the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. I think that encapsulates what an incredible performance of the team in all honesty did in 2016, and how successful our business model is going to be through the cycle. But the safety and welfare of our employees remain our number one priority, and nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains significantly better than industry averages, and we continue to work toward a zero incident environment at every location. The team did a phenomenal job this year continuing their success of year-over-year improvement, achieving a record Company wide performance. We reduced the annual recordable injury rate by a further 20%, and 63% of our locations were totally incident free. My sincere thanks to the entire STLD team for their dedication and continued focus. As Tricia outlined, the Steel platform continued to perform at the top of the industry in 2016, achieving numerous operating and financial records. Due to having one of the most highly-diversified and value-added product portfolios in the industry, we maintained an annual utilization rate of 87%. Once again, markedly better than the domestic industry rate of about 71%. 2016 certainly provided a changing landscape to the domestic steel market. Demand from the automotive and construction sectors remained positive. The demand related to heavy equipment, agriculture, and energy while not deteriorating further remained anemic through the year. The year was somewhat of a tale of two cities, flat roll steel versus long products. Domestically, flat roll steel utilization rates were much higher during 2016, compared to long product utilization rates. 2016 flat roll supply dynamics benefited from the decline in year-over-year imports. Hot roll coil import volume was down 25%, while sheet products in total were down 14%. When coupled with the starkly low customer inventory levels and steady demand, a positive sellers environment evolved. However, the fourth quarter was a bit of an anomaly in our mind, as flat roll customers were hesitant in late September and October to place orders ahead of expected scrap price declines. As we suggested at the time, the resulting short dip in order entry and pricing was purely procurement driven and not a result of any structural change in underlying demand. Order activity picked up significantly in November and December. Lead times stretched out and pricing recovered. Unfortunately, the same supply demand balance did not exist for long product steel, as production overcapacity persisted relative to the current demand environment. Although our total annual utilization rate was 87%, our long products utilization was only 68% with our engineered bar division suffering the most. Even though the SBQ expansion into small diameter bars has significantly helped utilization as these sizes are generally tied to the automotive sector which remained strong, operating rates were still far less than we would like. There is good news I think though. The FDA Steel platform still has about 1.5 million to two million tons of unused existing production in shipping capability, and most of the products would potentially be consumed by infrastructure and large civil engineering projects. Although no one can be certain, recent conversations suggest that it is highly likely that the new administration will keep their word and execute on a broad-based infrastructure plan which is deeply needed in our country. Columbus provides another significant earnings catalyst for us. The change the team has made are nothing short of transformational. The successful market and product diversification that has been achieved over the last two years is one of the key differentiators for the improved profitability that we realized in 2016, and will be key in the coming years as well. It\u2019s a very exciting time for the Columbus team, as they continue to focus on product diversification and increasing their value-added product capabilities. The team shipped prime Galvalume product in the second half of 2016, and the paint line was successfully commissioned in the fourth quarter with production starting in December about a month earlier. Prime painted product is already being shipped. The total $100 million investment provides 250,000 tons of annual coating capability, and further diversification into some of our highest margin products. We have two existing paint lines in Indiana, but this new line allows for high-quality double-wide steel and access to the southern U.S. and Mexican markets. Our existing painted steel customer base is excited to have the geographic and product diversification and optionality. Our Steel platform also continues to benefit from other organic growth investments as well. The $22 million investment for an additional 600,000 tons of annual flat roll pickering capability at our Butler flat roll division ramped up in 2016. The addition has meaningfully increased value-added sales. The $15 million investment to increase annual galvanizing productivity by an additional 180,000 tons at the Butler flat roll division is underway. We anticipate commissioning this summer with increased production capability through the second half of this year. Also, the recently announced $28 million investment at our Roanoke bar division to utilize excess melting and casting capability by adding equipment that will allow for multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing. With a highly competitive cost structure, we expect to have a strong market penetration being the only non-competing supplier of rebar to independent rebar fabricators. Commissioning should commence at the end of 2017. The operation and profitability of our Metals Recycling platform remained steady in the fourth quarter, despite weaker demand due to lower seasonal domestic steel mill utilization. Lower shipments and slightly lower metal spread were offset by the benefit from the team\u2019s continued focus on cost reductions, and better alignment of our Metals Recycling assets. In December, we entered into an agreement to sell some of our recycling assets in the Southeast and the U.S. We believe this transaction will benefit both parties, as these assets are non-core to our own Steel Operations and have closer proximity to the buyers\u2019 steel production facilities. The transaction better aligns our existing metals recycling locations to directly serve our own mills. While it\u2019s always difficult to part ways with our employees, we are confident that the buyer will provide a good home for them. While the team achieved a significant improvement in profitability during 2016, we see additional positive momentum for 2017. With the expectation of a continued strong U.S. dollar and relatively low scrap exports, we anticipate ample scrap supply and expect the pricing environment to stabilize as the year progresses. The Fabrication platform continues its ongoing historically strong performance, achieving record shipments in 2016. We have a great market penetration across all our product offerings. Since our acquisition of additional deck assets a little more than a year ago, we have gained considerable market share for deck. Approaching 30% for the full year of 2016, compared to only 24% prior to the acquisition. Our Fabrication Operations purchased 330,000 tons of steel from our own SDI mills in 2016. The power of pull-through volume from our Fabrication platform or steel that can be sourced from our own steel mills was critical in 2015 and beneficial in 2016 as well. This pull-through strategy remains one of our focuses for ongoing growth. The new millennium team continues to perform exceptionally, levering our national footprint. The strength of this business provides positive insight also into the continued strength in non-residential construction activity, which has been steady with the opportunity for growth in 2017. Relative to the macro environment, the Steel consuming sectors that were weak in 2015, such as energy and heavy equipment and agriculture, remained so in 2016. And those sectors that have been strong or recovering are continuing this path, such as automotive and construction. Reduced imports and lower than historically normal custom inventory levels coupled with steady demand have created a year-over-year improved environment for flat roll products that we expect to continue into 2017. We have a constructive view on our domestic steel consumption in the coming years. Domestic automotive production may be edging off record levels, but we believe total 2017 NAFTA production will grow slightly as Mexico continues to grow production with the current assets in place. This is highly complementary to our commerce division\u2019s automotive strategy. We believe there will be additional growth in the construction sector, especially for larger public sector infrastructure projects, which would greatly benefit our long products group. We also expect to see strong improvement activity within the energy sector. Going forward, we will continue to focus on adding value-added products to our portfolio that help insulate us from imports and create long-lasting customer partnerships such as our painted flat roll steel, highly engineered SBQ, and longer length rail. Our business model and execution on our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our industry. Customer focus coupled with our market diversification and low-cost operatings will support our ability to remain our best-in-class financial performance and differentiation. The Company and the team is poised for continued growth. And the strong character and determination of our employees provides the foundation for our success. I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and every one of them for their hard work and dedication, and remind them safety is always the first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our Company, customers, employees and shareholders alike, and look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone in the years ahead. So again, thank you for your time today. And Donna, please open the call for our questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Evan Kurtz of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Evan Kurtz : Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Theresa Wagler : Morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Evan Kurtz : I will ask a question on scrap. Just hearing recently that in Turkey, the scrap has come under a lot of pressure. And I am just wondering how that is influencing the conversations right now in the U.S. scrap market right now? Seasonally, demand is probably picking up a little bit. And I\u2019m wondering if that is going to mute some of the impact from what we\u2019re seeing on the export front? Russ Rinn : Evan, this is Russ. I think what we\u2019re seeing and what we see is we think probably December and January markets got a little hotter than they probably should have. So I am anticipating we will see a mild correction in February and maybe a little bit in March, but I think beyond that I think we\u2019re seeing a pretty robust market. I think the demand for our steel products continues. So I do not think we\u2019re going to see the corrections we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. I think there will be a mild retrenchment and we will go from there. Evan Kurtz : And maybe just a\u2026 Mark Millett : Just to kind of color that as to SDI specifically, a stable market sort of pricing environment should really aid the recycling profitability of OmniSource. The last two years, 2015 and 2016, you saw kind of prolonged downward trend in pricing. And when you\u2019re working in kind of an inventory based by it one month sell it the next, it is tough to make the spread. So it\u2019s just a stable, stable environment going through the year, I think is going to be positive for us. And I think Russ and the team have done a terrific job. You just look at the fourth quarter, volumes were down, margins were down, but our profitability was flat. And that was driven by a lot of cost containment, much of which was \u2013 came from the realignment of assets and we anticipate continued cost efficiencies there of probably $10 million or so. With the idling of the Wilmington shredder, Smithfield shredders, and with the sales of the Carolina and Georgia assets. Evan Kurtz : Great, thanks for the color. Maybe just one follow-up on that. Since it does seem like scrap may soften a bit in the first quarter and given your comments on some of the positive market dynamics on steel, would you expect metal margins the first quarter to expand versus the fourth quarter? Mark Millett : I think that\u2019s a good assumption. Evan Kurtz : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Gagliano of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. David Gagliano : Great. Thanks. My question was similar to what Evan just asked. I was curious about metal margins. Just to follow-up on that and as an add-on, can you frame just sort of given the current environment and the outlook for scrap, can you frame roughly the magnitude of the expected expansion metal margins, number one? And then number two, can you also give us some commentary regarding first-quarter volumes relative to the fourth quarter as well? Mark Millett : Well as you know, David, we would refrain from quantifying the margin expansion and again where the first quarter still unraveling. But we would anticipate expanded margin, and we would anticipate from what we see in the marketplace, volume expansion as well. And just to maybe preempt a question on the markets. And if I bifurcate that into flat roll and long products, in sheet, we believe the supply-side tightness will be sustained. When you look at the December eminent CI data, it showed the typical seasonal decline in shipments but inventories remain at historically low levels. But we believe the import volumes will remain constrained with the duties in place. The arbitrage against global price and it\u2019s certainly reversed and there is less import interest out there. Mill lead times for the industry and certainly for ourselves are healthy. Hot roll coil for us is at four to six week tag, and coated and coiled roll sheet is six plus weeks out. And the industry utilization, albeit at 71%, 72%, obviously flat roll is as much higher as an industry in general. So we believe the supply side is healthy and positive. On the demand side, demand remains pretty healthy and I think we should see growth. And again, I am just specifically talking about sheet. If NAFTA order will remain strong and SDI is certainly increasing its market share through the Columbus mill and Mexico activities. Non-residential continues incremental growth, I believe. The ABI has been positive, and it\u2019s been gone for the last three months I think. And Chris\u2019 group, New Millennium Building Systems\u2019 order activity, inquiry and bookings remains very, very strong there, which is good. As Theresa indicated, we have about 1.5 million, 2 million tons of latent capacity that is correlated strongly with non-residential construction. So as that incremental growth continues, we will benefit and certainly we\u2019ll get a major boost from what I believe is an inevitable infrastructure spend. On then once out there, I think people are going to be very, very surprised with the strength in the energy recovery. We talked last quarter about we started to see glimpses, but has strengthened dramatically. Our rig count is growing, energy pricing is going to be sustained we believe at that $50 or more, and we think on the flat roll sort of scalp side there is a lot less inventory or pipe or usable pipe than is anticipated. We are seeing significant pickup in order activity at Converse just the past four weeks. Their pipeline projects have taken off, and I think it is going to grow and surprise us all. So in general, we anticipate a positive flat roll market, sheet pricing we think will continue or should appreciate through the year, and the first-quarter volumes should pick up a little and margins expand. In long products, again as I said earlier, unlike sheet the overcapacity does persist, but we\u2019re starting to see a market change in customer sentiment, and market dynamics turning very, very positive, I believe. Beams remain under pressure from overcapacity, but consumption should grow as non-residential continues to grow. Specific to SDI, I think the team has done a great job expanding the product portfolio and we will continue to do that with angles in 2017. That seeing fabricator \u2013 or the fabricators are reporting strong order inquiry and are building backlog. And again, there should be an infrastructure spend there. So I think structural arena has got some positive momentum. Class one rail, although CapEx for the class one\u2019s has softened some, again, the team has been expanding the product range, getting into the high carbon grades and different sections and we think that the volumes will remain strong and flat through the year. And similarly, merchant shapes seems to be showing some signs of recovery with the fabricators having stronger backlogs and service centers restocking. But most significantly, and I think we\u2019re excited, is a very strong rebound in engineered bar and SBQ. It has taken place probably in the last four to five weeks. But the team is probably more optimistic now than it has been in 2 or 3 years, and the customers are definitely in a markedly significant difference frame of mind. And they are starting to pull out there orders or pullout from their forecasts, and it is most noticeably in the oil patch. We\u2019ve seen the tubers and the forages are significantly stronger than we have seen for a very long time. And I think we are even seeing a rebound in Caterpillar off-road. So we\u2019re excited about that. So long products in general, we believe is \u2013 it\u2019s going to see some good growth through the year. Evan Kurtz : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Korn of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Justin Kwan : Hey, everyone. This is Justin filling in for Matt. Theresa Wagler : Morning. Justin Kwan : I was wondering, have you guys had a chance to interact with anyone from the new administration yet? And if you have, what have the talks been about? Mark Millett : We have not. Justin Kwan : Okay. Mark Millett : Have we? Everyone is shaking their head no. Justin Kwan : Okay. And then just one more. Did the potential for reopening NAFTA cause any complications with marketing plans with Columbus and the shipments to Mexico at all, or is there anything we\u2019re missing on that? Mark Millett : No, we are continuing to look at Mexico as a strong marketplace for us. There are a lot of existing assets in place there. You just have to travel through the industrial centers there. Consumption is massive, and we\u2019re not looking for a large portion of that. We shipped 200,000 tons into Mexico last year, and the intent is to increase that to around about 400,000 tons. And I think we are confident that it\u2019s going to happen. Again, I think with the new administration, you have got some very, very positive things that they reportedly want to do, tax reform, trade, some sensible regulation. The balance is going to be not to shut down trade with Mexico or Canada or \u2013 I guess we need flow going both ways across the borders. But we are going forward, but we are not planned. Justin Kwan : Okay. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tony Rizzuto of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Tony Rizzuto : Thanks very much. Good morning, Mark, Theresa, and Russ. Just got a couple questions here if I maybe. The first one is, Mark, on your comments over the latent capacity that you have. Over what time period do you envision that you would be able to operate that more fully and be able to achieve that 1.5 million to 2 million tons? Mark Millett : I think that it\u2019s probably the second half of the year that we\u2019ll ramp into that. We are going to see volume growth through \u2013 in the first half compared to the fourth quarter for sure. But from an infrastructure build, that will ramp up obviously. And you have two sectors there, you have the fast track where there\u2019s numerous projects already kind of lined up and they will likely, and we\u2019re starting to see them more I think, but they will likely come on in the second quarter. And then any infrastructure buildout from the new administration, that\u2019s probably a second half and going into\u2026 Tony Rizzuto : Okay. And then, if I may, just there\u2019s a lot of things arguably about the new administration, which are very supportive to the steel demand and the steel industry in general. And maybe following up on the question about NAFTA, are there any other areas that worry you about any potential outcomes with new policy? What is most concerning to you potentially? Mark Millett : Again, everything is speculative I think right now, Tony. I think they\u2019ve come out with guns blazing and following up on the some of their promises. And I think tax reform, as I said, tax reform and sensible regulation will certainly help the country have a more positive business climate and boost the economy. And their position on trade, I think \u2013 we are already benefiting dramatically from the cases that were approved last year. They can only sort of vulcanize that environment. I think the sensitivities or the balance is trade and not getting into a trade war, and hopefully we have some sensible people advising that new administration and we won\u2019t get that point. Tony Rizzuto : Thanks, Mark. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brett Levy of Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy : Hey, Mark, hey, Theresa. Is it on your plate at all to consider adding any assets in Mexico, and have you heard anything from competitors or, I don\u2019t know, even substitute products that sort of thing, to add capacity to address the capacity that is already left for Mexico? Mark Millett : I guess our strategy in Mexico currently, Brett, is commercial more than bricks and mortar. Brett Levy : So continue to send stuff that way. I mean, is there any advantage to putting SBQ or any other form of capacity there as opposed to shipping it to them? Mark Millett : We\u2019re not looking at that I would suggest currently. They obviously are steel short. They import pretty much all oil products, but that is not something that we are considering right this second. Brett Levy : All right. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our question is coming from Seth Rosenfeld of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Good morning. I have a couple questions on the outlook for the long steel market. Can you just comment about more on what you\u2019re currently seeing for long steel import trends into the U.S.? In 2017, have you already seen some countries begin back out of the U.S. proactively following the law into the most recent rebar trade case? And can you give us a little bit of a sense of what level of confidence you have looking forward, both with regards to the Turkey trade case also including two other Asian peers? And also the Mexican tariff review, what impact could that have in the market various scenarios? Thank you. Glenn Pushis : Good morning. This is Glenn Pushis. The rebar trade case, we are involved in it but we\u2019re just not a real big player in that sector. At this point, we do maybe 50,000 or 60,000 tons in arguably about 9 million ton market here in North America. So it is really hard for me to answer any of those questions, Mark, with much distinct knowledge about that. Seth Rosenfeld : Okay, thank you. I guess then looking the other areas of long steel where you\u2019re more focused like SBQ. You commented very positive on the demand trends. Can you just talk about what headwinds you could see the market with regards to other local capacity domestically within the U.S., or if you could see the risk of imports once again coming in should those prices really start to pick up as you mentioned earlier? Mark Millett : Again, our focus at Pittsboro is principally in engineered bar not in commercial commodity type SBQ. The import pressure comes in just 1-inch RAND 1045, 1018 commodity type materials. The team has done a phenomenal job down there building relationships with the Caterpillars and their automotive, the forches whereby it can take 2 or 3 years to get qualified for a certain application. Those cannot be substituted one month in one month out by imports. So I do not believe SBQ is dramatically impacted from \u2013 or at least our SBQ business, dramatically impacted from import pressure. Seth Rosenfeld : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Gambardella of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Gambardella : Good morning and congratulations on another good quarter. Mark Millett : Thank you, Mike. Michael Gambardella : You\u2019re welcome, Mark thanks. I was watching CNN on Tuesday, the second day that Trump was in the office, and noticed that the U.S. Steel\u2019s CEO was standing there next to Trump smiling in the White House office. And I was just stunned over the last 35 years of following this industry to think that a steel executive would be invited into the White House the second day a president was in the office just shocked me. What do you think you can expect to get out of Washington on the trade front? Even I would say on the sheet side, even if they could strictly enforce the laws that are on the books right now would be a big positive for you and the rest of the players in the sheet market, and I\u2019m really talking about the diversion that China is doing through Vietnam and other countries to evade the trade tariffs that they have in place. Because legally, you would think China wouldn\u2019t be able to export a pound of sheet steel into the U.S. given the tariffs they have on hot roll, cold roll, and coated, recently. What are your expectations for strict enforcement of the trade laws that we have right now coming out of Washington? Mark Millett : I think you actually likely answered your own question, Michael. I believe there will be vigorous enforcement of the anti-circumvention laws. If you consider the whack-a-mole we saw last year with Vietnam, I think Vietnam ended with 800,000 tons of the coated product coming in which is huge, huge volume. That, and as you know there is a case or intervention pending there and I think that will end positively. Certainly the rhetoric and the trade position that we\u2019re seeing out of Washington right this second gives you a high likelihood or high probability that that will be successful. And that is very meaningful, certainly meaningful for us with the Galvalume product that has been coming in and the building product commodity prepayments coming in. Just the non-market subsidization, and I think a strong point will be just taking action on the currency manipulation by China. Michael Gambardella : What other benefits could you see coming out of trade in terms of regulations that you \u2013 that may have been imposed on you guys over the last five, eight years? Mark Millett : Well if you look in that timeframe, and I do not know whether you are implying or inferring like a section 201 type activity, again, it would just be speculative for us to talk about at this moment. Michael Gambardella : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot and congratulations again, Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you. Mike, just I guess one thought. Relative to the trade cases that we already have in place, because I think it\u2019s illustrative to look at the downturn in Q4 of 2015 and the recent one in 2016. Both are relatively procurement driven. But you had in 2015, hot roll coil plummeted like $3.20 and that down cycle lasted for the fourth quarter into January. This most recent one, hot roll did come off, only down to about $4.20 and obviously it was almost an eight week dip. And I think that that foreshortening of that cycle and the lessening of the debt is a result of those trade cases in place. And it gives us confidence anyway that for some time to come we\u2019re going to see a different pricing environment for our products, a much stronger pricing environment for our products. Michael Gambardella : Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Phil Gibbs : Just had a question on the mix in sheet products in the quarter, and what that breakout was, Theresa. Theresa Wagler : Phil, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 yes I have that for you. So for hot band and P&O it was 781,000 tons, cold roll was 112,000 tons, and coated was 673,000 tons for the total of 1.6 billion. Phil Gibbs : Okay. And can you remind us how much lag there is in the sheet business in terms of how much business is direct spot versus quarterly or monthly indexes? Theresa Wagler : Yes, so we\u2019re still have right around that 40% to 45% that is contractual, Phil, and that is what I would put a lag on. The rest of it truly is spot business. Phil Gibbs : Okay, I appreciate that. And the last one I have is on electricity and power rights. I know natural gas itself is not necessarily a big driver for you guys, but electricity is. Have we seen power rates move higher as call it the last 12 to 18 months have gone on with higher call it info cost minimum in oil and natural gas? Theresa Wagler : Phil, it is nothing that would be significant enough for us to note. Phil Gibbs : Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Millett : And, Phil, if I may, and it maybe self evident and most of recognize it. But just for perhaps the newcomers on the call, when we talk about contract pricing at 40%, that\u2019s volume driven and pricing is actually against index. So there is no fixed price contracts out there, just for clarity. Phil Gibbs : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jorge Beristain of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jorge Beristain : Hey, good morning, Mark and Theresa. I had a question about the Columbus mill. Could you just recap again, you said the percentage of value added has increased from when you guys took it over, could you just give me those numbers again? Theresa Wagler : Well when we actually purchased Columbus in 2014, over 60% of their shipments were what we would call more just straight hot band. And today, they are actually operating at almost full capacity on their galvanizing lines. And we just added a paint line which will add 250,000 tons of really our highest margin product throughout our flat roll operation, and that actually started. And so we expect to ramp that up throughout 2017 with new and existing customers. I would say today, if you look at that same percentage of just straight hot band, it is more in the area of 45% and we hope to get that even down lower. I think we could get it as low as 40% at some point in time. Jorge Beristain : So would it be fair to say you\u2019ve had about a 20 percentage point increase in value add? Theresa Wagler : Yes. Absolutely. Jorge Beristain : Okay. And then just on the energy exposure from Columbus. Because at the time you\u2019d acquired it, energy was heading south at the time. What is the energy exposure there historically, and how much is it for your Firm overall and how quickly could you re-ramp up service to the energy sector if those pipelines come back on? Theresa Wagler : So from an energy perspective, when we bought Columbus, they had a real strong concentration. It was probably at least 20% that was tied directly into that energy sector, and there\u2019s nothing that they need to do to ramp up capacity it is just different products that they produce on existing equipment. So it is really about the customer base itself, and they have maintained great relationships with those energy customers. And so, Barry, you can jump in if you would like. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of ramping it up, it is a matter of keeping a diversified customer base that they stay at high utilization rates. Barry Schneider : Absolutely, Theresa. And I think one of the things that I would like to add is that we continually add new products, so we are able to make higher strike steels in wider widths which is what that sector requires. And we do have a capital project this year to upgrade a coiler to allow us to go heavier in gauge. Although a relatively small project, $10 million or so, we want to be able to go after the projects in that sector that make sense for us. So it is always going to be good sector, we just do not want to be 20% dependent on it. So we never want to leave it, we just want to make sure we are providing the best products to that sector as possible. Theresa Wagler : And the other division that we have leverage related to energy really is in the engineered bar division, and that is what Mark spoke about earlier about the optimism that we see there. And the other thing I just don\u2019t want to leave the call without talking about Columbus as far as a lever, it\u2019s not just the diversification in customer base and product, which has been phenomenal. It is hard to describe the change from even 2015 to 2016 with Columbus, But they still have additional what I would say earnings capability, both regarded to the paint line and other products that they are developing there including in the automotive arena. But additionally, there\u2019s still some cost benefits that I think can be realized as well in 2017 and 2018. So Columbus is not a fully told story in my mind. Jorge Beristain : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Fields of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Fields : Hello, everyone. Congrats again on the nice year. I just wanted to ask you, and I apologize if I missed this earlier in the call. But one of your competitors that\u2019s been pretty active in the downstream space buying up some fabricators in their pipe and tube sector, would you consider looking at the space and maybe some of the either smaller or larger players that are available? Mark Millett : I think we \u2013 I think it is better answered by \u2013 just saying we are obviously focused on growth, it remains our first priority from a cash allocation perspective. And we look at an array of opportunities. Matthew Fields : When you say growth, is there one particular tilt that you\u2019re preferring whether it is upstream or downstream or anything like that? Mark Millett : I think we \u2013 as we have said in the past, two principal areas of focus. One is, as I mentioned, pull-through volume, downstream opportunities that will allow us to support our own mills in times sort of down cycle. That is one specific focus. The second is obviously we\u2019re still makers first and foremost in downstream, so a higher-margin value-add type products is another focus for us. Matthew Fields : And is there sort of a size that you\u2019re focused on, or would you not be uncomfortable going to a $1 billion or $2 billion size acquisition? Theresa Wagler : Matt, I think if you look at the capital structure today and you look at our net leverage and our credit metrics and the cash flow generation, we absolutely can do things that are sizable. But we can also do maybe several meaningful medium-sized transactions as well. So it\u2019s really \u2013 we have got \u2013 we\u2019re in a great spot to have optionality. Matthew Fields : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : I think on behalf of the team here, Russ, Barry, Chris, Glenn, and Tricia, and Theresa, we would like to thank you for your time today and for your support. And as importantly to our customers, we will continue to try and provide the greater value to you as the years go on. And to our employees, again, a reminder, safety is absolutely paramount for us. Nothing is more important to us, and so be safe out there and thanks for all you do. So thank you, everyone Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Tricia and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call and we certainly appreciate you and thank you for sharing your time with us today. Simply, the entire SDI team performed phenomenally well this quarter. Each of our business platforms improved earnings, with many divisions achieving record line operating rates. And I believe the results really speak for themselves and the intentional positioning of the company will continue to reap the benefits of improving market dynamics.  But to begin, Theresa, would you comment on our financial results? Theresa Wagler : Absolutely. Good morning, everyone. I also want to recognize the team's performance across our platforms, delivering an excellent first quarter performance. Our first quarter 2017 net income was $201 million or $0.82 per diluted share, slightly above our guidance range of between $0.77 and $0.81 per share. This compares to net income of $63 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of last year and $20 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the sequential quarter. First quarter 2017 revenues were $2.4 billion, a 24% improvement over the sequential fourth quarter. All operating platforms improved. However, the growth was primarily driven by our steel operations as both average selling values and volumes improved. Our operating income for the first quarter increased over 75% to $335 million compared to sequential quarter adjusted results. Again, a solid performance by everyone as almost each location improved profitability, although the steel platform experienced the most significant growth of $135 million, a 62% increase from last quarter. For the first quarter 2017, steel shipments increased 12% to 2.5 million tons. Volumes increased across all divisions. Flat roll improved 11% as demand was strong and customer inventory levels continue to be at historically low levels. Our long products [indiscernible] increased shipments 16%, largely driven from our Engineered Bar and Structural and Rail division. Metal spread expansion in flat roll and increased volume across the platform resulted in operating income from our steel operations of $352 million, a significant improvement from fourth quarter. First quarter 2017 steel platform average selling prices increased $63 per ton to $743, outpacing the increase in average scrap cost of $44 per ton.  For our metals recycling platform, higher domestic steel mill utilization also resulted in increased ferrous scrap demand and a 14% improvement in our ferrous shipments as well as a 12% improvement in metal spread, resulting in strong operating metric. First quarter operating income for our metals recycling platform more than doubled to $21 million compared to $10 million in the sequential fourth quarter. Additionally, we closed on the sale of several non-core scrapyards located in southeastern U.S. The sale was basically transacted at book value and therefore, no significant gain or loss was recognized.  The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically integrated model, benefiting both the steel mills and the scrap operations. Metals recycling has maintained a higher-than-historical percentage of total internal ferrous shipments to support SDI steel mills at 64% in the first quarter. For fabrication, driven by record shipments, first quarter 2017 operating income increased 34% sequentially to $24 million. It was typically a seasonally lower period. Nonresidential construction demand continues to be steady throughout much of the United States and we continue to see strong quote and order entry activity. During the first quarter 2017, we generated cash flow from operations of $240 million, with operational working capital using just over $150 million in the quarter. The increased working capital was primarily driven by higher customer count values based on increased prices and volume. Inventory values also increased in the quarter somewhat. We grew our cash dividend in the first quarter by 11% to $0.155 per common share based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash. We also repurchased $61 million of our common stock during the first quarter, pursuant to the October 2016 board-authorized $450 million program. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. As a result, we maintained liquidity of $2.2 million at March 31 comprised of our undrawn revolver and an available cash of $967 million. First quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $421 million and trailing 12-month EBITDA was nearly $1.4 billion. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with a strong credit and capital structure profile provides great opportunity for continued organic and inorganic growth. We're squarely focused on the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. Well, the welfare of employees remains our #1 priority and nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains significantly better than industry averages and we continue to work toward a 0 incident environment. The team is doing a phenomenal job there. Also, over 80% of our locations achieved 0 record injuries so far this year. We also reduced our total recordable injury rate in the first quarter by 11% when compared to last year's full results which, I'd remind you, was the best ever for our company. My sincere thanks to the entire team for their dedication and continued focus on our first and foremost priority. The steel platform had an outstanding quarter in part because we have one of the most diversified and value-added product profiles in the industry. We operated at utilization rate of 95% during the first quarter, once again, markedly better than the domestic industry rate of about 75%. Demand from the automotive sector remained steady and construction continued to improve. Additionally, the energy-related demand improvement that we discussed on our January conference call actually strengthened further during the quarter. We received related orders both at Columbus Flat Roll Division and Engineered Bar Products Division. Additionally, there was an overall general demand improvement for our SBQ steel which typically suggests broader industrial sector momentum.  Our earnings improvement was primarily driven by the flat roll group. Domestically, flat-rolled steel utilization rates remained much higher in the first quarter compared to long product utilization rates. Flat-rolled steel benefited from sturdy demand coupled with continued favorable supply dynamics. Customer inventory levels remained at historical lows and imports in total were down year-over-year for the quarter. It should be noted, though, that despite hot-rolled coil imports being down considerably, cold-rolled sheet and coated were up materially year-over-year. Additionally, pipe and tube imports grew over 35% in the quarter. Our long product steel shipments improved in the quarter, but selling values remained under pressure from excess domestic production capability coupled with elevated import levels which grew over 15% in the quarter. Although our consolidated quarterly production utilization rate was 95%, our Long Products division's operated at 78%. While not as high as we'd like, it's an improvement from last year's average rate of 68%. The most significant change was seen in SBQ. Our Engineered Bar Products Division operated over 70% of its current capacity compared to just over 50% in 2015 and '16. Not only did we see improved demand environment, but the Engineered Bar Division is also benefiting from the bulk and pull-through volume. Based on 2016 shipments, the SDI steel platform has over 1.5 million tons of unused shipping capability. And most of this latent capacity is in product types that would potentially be consumed by infrastructure and large civil engineering projects.  The flat roll mill in Columbus provides another significant and sustainable earnings catalyst. The changes the team has already made are transformational. The successful market and product diversification that was achieved over the last 2 years is one of the key differentiators for the improved profitability realized in 2016 and will continue to benefit the coming years as well. It remains an exciting time for the Columbus team as they continue to focus on product diversification and increasing their value-add product capabilities. The team completed construction of $100 million paint line in the fourth quarter of 2016. This investment provides 250,000 tons of annual pre-paint capability and further diversification into some of the highest-margin products. We have 2 existing paint lines in Indiana and this new line is truly state-of-the-art facility, allowing for even higher-quality double-wide steel and facilitates access to the southern U.S. and Mexican markets. Our existing customer base is excited to have that geographic and product diversification optionality. The startup is going well with painted shipments of just under 13,000 tons in the first quarter. And I've got to add that I've been down there just recently and I've seen many lines over my lifetime, but it is the most phenomenal facility I've ever seen. And anytime you folks have a chance to get down there, you should go visit. It is phenomenal. The team did a marvelous, marvelous job. Our steel platform continues to benefit from other organic growth investments as well. We're investing $15 million to increase annual galvanizing productivity by 180,000 tons at Butler, further increasing the mill's value-added production capability. We anticipate commissioning the equipment this summer and increase production capability available for the second half of this year. We're also investing $28 million to utilize excess melting and casting capability at our Roanoke Bar Division. We're adding equipment that will allow for multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing. With a highly competitive cost structure, we expect to have strong market penetration as we will be the only noncompeting producer for rebar in the region selling to independent fabricators. Commission is on schedule to start at the end of this year. Regarding our raw material platform, the profitability of our metals recycling platform more than doubled in the first quarter 2017. As increased domestic steel mill utilization strengthened, ferrous scrap shipments and improving market dynamics allowed metal spread appreciation. Shipments improved 14%, while average ferrous selling values rose over 35% in the quarter. We anticipate a continuation on the relatively strong U.S. dollar and associated low scrap exports, supporting ample scrap supply and a more stabilized scrap price environment as the year progresses.  We also closed on sale of some recycling assets located in the southeastern U.S. at the beginning of March. This transaction better aligns our remaining metals recycling locations to directly serve our mills and also provides the opportunity for additional administrative cost savings. The fabrication platform continued its strong performance, achieving record quarterly shipments in what is typically a seasonally lower demand period. In fact, the order backlog at the end of March was at a record high volume. The team is achieving great market penetration in both joist and deck. Fabrication operations purchased 330,000 tons of steel from SDI steel mills in 2016 and are on track to continue to purchase meaningful quantities in 2017. The power of pull-through volume when fabrication sources steel from our own mills is a significant advantage to keeping our steel platform utilization rates higher during weaker demand environments. The New Millennium team continues to perform exceptionally, levering our national footprint and providing quality product. The ongoing strength of this business and continued customer optimism also provides positive insight into the continued strength of the nonresidential construction activity. With steady to growing demand, lower-than-historic supply chain inventory levels and trade constraints in place, the flat roll supply-demand environment is very positive and we expect these dynamics to continue. We have a constructive view on the domestic steel consumption in the coming years. Domestic automotive production may be edging off record levels, but we believe total NAFTA production will grow slightly as Mexico continues to grow production with current assets in place. This is highly complementary to our Columbus Division's automotive strategy. We believe there will be additional growth in the construction sector, especially for larger public sector infrastructure projects which would greatly benefit our Long Products group. We also anticipate continued improvement within the energy sector.  So going forward, we continue to focus on adding value-added products to our portfolio that help insulate us from imports and create long-lasting customer partnerships, such as our painted flat-rolled steel, highly engineered SBQ and longer-length rail. In addition, the pull-through steel volume strategy remains one of our focuses for ongoing inorganic growth. Our business model and execution of our long term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our industry competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, supports our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance and differentiation. The company and the team are poised for continued growth. The strong character and determination of our employees provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of them for their hard work and dedication and remind them safety is always the first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, employees and shareholders alike and look forward to creating new opportunities for all and the years ahead.  So again, thank you for your time today and Rob, we're open for questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Seth Rosenfeld : Seth Rosenfeld from Jefferies. I have one question picking off on -- I have one quick question picking off on your realized sale prices over the last quarter. Your ASP seems like it's stronger than what we were forecasting. Can you just talk a little bit about any shift you're seeing in product mix or contract mix to help us better understand what's driving your current robust realized prices and, I guess tied to that, where we're seeing the outside strength in your sales volumes in flat steel as well? You discussed in the report some of the drivers on the long side, but I'd like to hear a bit more detail on flats there. Theresa Wagler : So on average sales price perspective, Seth, you've seen a pretty significant product shift with the addition of the volume from SBQ, from our Engineered Bar Division. So that was impactful to the average sales price for the quarter as well as just the long products in general as well as some appreciation in product mix within the flat roll group. Although the paint line is just having a little bit of impact right now in Columbus, we're seeing very good strength at Columbus on the rest of the value-add side of the equation. So we're seeing an overall product shift toward the value-add side and that volume impact from long products actually helps support the average sales price being maybe higher than what you would have forecast originally. As it relates to demand for flat roll, we've seen a lot of demand, both steady demand in automotives. A lot of that's been impacting core Columbus. Construction is remaining very strong for us, but we're also seeing increased demand from the energy sector, specifically at Columbus. And that's something that we didn't expect to see as much strength in the first quarter as we've seen. Barry, is there anything else to add on an end market perspective for flat rolls? Barry Schneider : Just that we continue to work on the energy products that fit our mix very well. And it's good to see the return of buying activity in that sector. Operator : Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : I just have a couple of quick questions. First of all, I think in your prepared remarks, you said you expect a more stabilized scrap price environment, I think, for the remainder of the year. My question is given, obviously, the drop in iron ore and more recently, Chinese billet prices, do you think that will actually have a negative impact on scrap prices in the U.S. over the next few months? That's my first question. Mark Millett : Russ, do you want-- Russel Rinn : Again, I think as we look forward and look out into the balance of the year, it looks to us that the supply balance is well maintained throughout. Although we've had some iron ore prices go down, the pig iron prices have remained very bullish with the disruptions out of the freight and that's really a more closer benchmark to what happens domestically for us. So I think if we look out, we don't see anything that moves the needle drastically down or drastically up. We see a pretty steady state going out through the balance of the year from this point. David Gagliano : And then just a quick follow-up. Any early, early comments on the headlines this morning about the potential special investigation on steel imports under the Trade Expansion Act? Mark Millett : I guess it will be too early to speculate, Dave. I think it does give you insight to the positive trade environment in Washington right now, but time will tell. Operator : Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Jorge Beristain : I guess just really following up on the Trump Buy America, could you point to any specific subsectors of products where you think that this would make a difference, that historically, they may have been supplied by imports, but now, because of these new potential regulations, there'll be a switch to American-based products? Mark Millett : Well, I think obviously, energy is a big focus and as the energy markets continue to rebound -- and one has to remember, energy used to be, not too long ago, only 2 years ago, about 8% to 10% of steel demand in the States. And that is a big outlook for hot-rolled coil, certainly, for us at Columbus. So I think energy would be a principal focus there. And I think also, in the long products side of things, if you look at the heavy beam market recently, imports of what I call roll bar, just straight bar, have increased over the last few years. But most significantly, prefabricated beam has been increasing at a dramatic rate. And so there are several projects, the Hudson Yards project in New York, the Sasol chemical plant down in Louisiana. A lot of imported prefab material has come in and Buy American doctrine would certainly help that, particularly at least for government-sponsored projects. Jorge Beristain : And then just on finished product imports of steel, we've been seeing they're up still pretty sharply quarter-on quarter, year-on-year about 7%. Can you speak to what's going on there with particularly the still high CRC prices in the U.S.? Are you starting to feel a little bit of import pressure at the margin just because, despite the trade cases, we're still seeing imports up year-on-year? Mark Millett : We're not seeing much pressure at all, in all honesty. I think the -- absolutely, there's a little attraction there on the cold-rolled sheet, coated side because the arbitrage is grown compared to hot-rolled coil. Hot-rolled coil imports, obviously down dramatically. And despite Asian pricing for hot-band going down, that stuff just can't get in. On the coated and cold-rolled sheet side, part of that, I do believe, is demand and -- or the supply and demand balance because the coating lines are full in America today. And so there's almost a need for a slight uptick in that product line. Operator : Our next question comes from Curt Woodworth with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Curtis Woodworth : Mark, you talked about inflecting demand, certainly, for SBQ and merchant bar, yet it seems like the industry hasn't been able to get much price support for those products. I know that you and Gerdau rescinded a $40 per ton price increase in early April. And I think on the rebar side, I know you don't do a lot of commodity rebar, but Nucor rescinded that as well. So can you just talk about why, despite stronger demand momentum on the long products side, it hasn't really been able to get more material metal spread expansion? And do you think that there's an opportunity for any potential trade action with respect to either beams or specialty bar going forward? Mark Millett : I think when you look at the merchant shapes, long bar, that side of the industry, if you look at utilization rates as an industry, yes, we're 74%, 75% or thereabouts. But I think one needs to bifurcate that into sheet and long products. Sheet is running, I'd say almost flat out, 95% today to a large degree. On the long products side, utilization rates are still -- they're improving, but they're still struggling. And so you don't have a strong sort of sellers market environment to dictate an increase in pricing and spread. So I think it's just a matter of competition. We do believe that demand is growing across virtually all steel sectors, steel markets and that will certainly improve. We're certainly seeing in SBQ -- SBQ order rate has grown dramatically. The utilization at that mill is very, very positive and so you're going to see, I think, some pricing strength in that arena. Merchants, rebar, still going to be a little challenged. Curtis Woodworth : And the potential for any trade action on long products? Mark Millett : Well, right now, you have a rebar case, I think pending, right, Glenn? Glenn Pushis : Yes. Mark Millett : And I think the market in that arena will have to take care of it and it will [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Levy with Loop Capital. Brett Levy : You've talked with, I don't know, some enthusiasm about the energy sector and that sort of thing. And I'm just wondering, as you look at your portfolio, is welded pipe or seamless pipe or -- is there something that sort of fits into your front-end capabilities that would make sense in terms of expansion ideas in the energy sector? Mark Millett : I will answer that. As we normally do, we look at all opportunities out there. And whatever opportunities check all the boxes, we will pursue. Brett Levy : Got it. And then in terms of share buybacks, are you guys still feeling fairly aggressive about that? Theresa Wagler : Hey, Brett, I was going to say [indiscernible] if I help you recognize that. Brett Levy : I recognize it. Theresa Wagler : We were active in the quarter. We repurchased about 1.8 million shares for about $61 million and we continue to be active. We continue to be opportunistic and enter the market from time to time where it makes sense to us to do so. We still believe that it's a valuable thing to execute. Operator : Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners : I was wondering -- I know you talked a little bit already about the imports on galvanized and cold-rolled maybe because the markets are running pretty full out on those products, but there's some concern among distributors specifically about large amounts of product coming from a few countries, say, Turkey and Russia. I mean, do you think that there's a potential to continue to pursue trade cases? Or do you think we're tapped out on the flat-rolled side? Mark Millett : I think the trade cases in place will -- should be enforced and obviously, the political climate in Washington is proceeding in that manner. I think a huge case is the anti-circumvention case against Vietnam. That is ongoing and should see the light of day June, July or -- this summer. I think people need to focus more, in all honesty, on the marketplace in America than worrying too much about the import level and worrying too much about iron ore is coming off. And there seems to be a commentary or view that the price [indiscernible] softening is going to occur midyear. And perhaps, on the -- Timna, perhaps, I'm a little bit of a contrarian, but I think the market dynamics in place is -- they're strong and are certainly going to support the current pricing environment, if not more. You've got a domestic market strength that is supply-side driven today and is supported by strong and, I think, growing demand and it's going to mitigate any softness in raw materials. We mentioned, on the demand side, automotive still remains strong. It may have turned over a little bit, but it's going to remain strong for the rest of the year. Nonresidential construction is continuing to grow. Energy is coming back. All we have to do is look at the recent MSCI data, where shipments in March which I think normally, month-over-month tends to lighten up a little bit, they increased, I think, significantly, materially. And the inventory levels in the system today are at 2 months. If you look at sheet or flat roll, they're only 1.8 months which is a very, very, very low level. So supply chain inventory is very, very tight. You do have the import cases in place today and they're going to be enforced in a much stronger vein going forward. Then you have an industry with lead times stretching out. So it's, I think, a very good, positive market environment that's going to support good pricing and good spreads through the rest of the year. And it's -- I would argue that we're at a bit of a tipping point. I think inventories today are at a very precarious position. The short inventory sort of maximized turn business model or the consolidating service center industry has been accommodated these past years by a challenged market, mills with low utilization rates, lead times short and they've been able to sort of buy off the floor, almost, of the mills. And I think that's about to change. So I view the market in a very positive vein right now. Timna Tanners : It will be fantastic to see the skeptics proven wrong on the scrap side and concerns over Chinese hot-rolled and the focus, again, on the U.S. market and demand will be refreshing. I guess I'll switch gears here to ask just about the war chest that you've developed and there's a lot of speculation about what you plan to do with it. I just wanted to know if you could clarify a little bit in terms of the value-added focus you've talked about. Is that more organic or acquisitive? Is there anything else you can detail to us on the way you're thinking about growth opportunities? Mark Millett : Well, thanks for pointing that out, Timna. I think the strategic positioning of the company is certainly clearly demonstrating our cash flow generation capability. Up to this point, I think we've approached cash allocation in a very balanced, sort of strategic, intentional way. We've taken advantage of the capital markets over the last 18 months to reduce debt. We've continued the positive dividend profile. You saw that we increased it 8%. Theresa Wagler : 11%. Mark Millett : 11%, sorry, 11% this first quarter. And not only did we come up or advertise a share repurchase program, we're executing on that program going forward. And that's a $450 million program. So I think our approach -- we've demonstrated a positive approach today. With that, growth, both organic and inorganic, remains our first priority. You've seen -- we've talked about very small projects, I guess $75 million, $100 million worth of small organic projects across the company being implemented and coming onstream kind of this year, early next year, all of which have less than a 24-month payback. The Columbus paint line is a phenomenal facility, as I said earlier. That is going to further amplify the earnings capability at Columbus. And I've got to emphasize Columbus. That mill has gone through a transformation. The breadth of product or market diversification and geographic penetration is phenomenal, pushing a lot more product down the value-add stream, pushing material into Mexico. We shipped about 200,000 tons into Mexico last year and that will grow to probably 400,000 tons over the next 18 months. They penetrated the automotive arena, gaining market share dramatically. We shipped, I think, a couple hundred thousand tons in '16 and over the next 18 months, that will grow to about 400,000 tons also. And as the energy markets are coming back, the team has continued to develop better grades and so we're taking advantage of the premium of those stronger grades there in Columbus. So that mill has transformed itself and we always said that it has the potential to outearn the Butler facility which has been the ores for many years and probably the most profitable steel mill in the world. Well, we had one month in the first quarter that the Columbus guys have been [indiscernible], so that's coming to fruition. So I think the sort of organic growth is going to be material. On the inorganic side, again, not to get into specifics, the pipeline was full last year with opportunities that we assessed and it remains full. It's surprising, actually, what opportunities are coming to the table. And we will continue to assess them with a focus on value-add downstream processor that our team has showed a propensity to outperform most, a focus on pull-through volume and not forgetting that we're steel producers, first and foremost and have done an okay job in the most part and we'll continue to pursue those sorts of opportunities, too. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Philip Gibbs : Is the Pittsboro mills supplying billet right now to the North American seamless tube mills? And if so, was the ramp in OCTG production that we've seen more recently here something that you benefited from on the seamless side? Glenn Pushis : No. This is Glenn Pushis. We're not supplying any billet to anyone out of the Pittsboro plant. It's all being self-consumed at the plant itself. Philip Gibbs : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And Theresa, the mix within the sheet business, can you provide that? Theresa Wagler : Yes, I'm sorry, Phil. I can, absolutely. So hot-rolled and pickle and oil were 884,000 tons, cold-rolled was 141,000 tons and coated was 711,000 tons. And there's a little bit more to add, I think, on the energy market. I want to make sure that we're clear. We actually are shipping to energy customers from... Glenn Pushis : Well, Phil, this is Glenn. When you asked about billets, some of what we do, we take those billets and then roll them on a large mill down there in Pittsboro, so some of our customers, we do supply a rolled product to them for seamless tubing. So I don't want to be disingenuous and tell you that we're not supplying that market. We certainly are, but we don't supply any [indiscernible] billets out into that market. Philip Gibbs : Okay. Yes, I'm just trying to figure out whether or not Pittsboro is supplying, I guess, the seamless tubing market. And I guess the answer is yes, but it's a little bit more a refined product that you're putting in there. Glenn Pushis : Exactly correct. Theresa Wagler : The three main drivers for the increase in the SBQ shipments, Phil, from an end market perspective were energy and, actually surprising, mining equipment kind of and some automotive as well because we've been gaining automotive share in Pittsboro very effectively. So those were the 3 main market drivers. Philip Gibbs : Got it. And then last question here is just on the general outlook for metal spreads in the second quarter versus the first quarter, maybe anything that you can provide on that as you see it today. Mark Millett : Again, we found the look too near and I think we prefer just to say, hey, we see a very positive market environment for the rest of the year on the pricing side and a very sort of stable raw material scrap profile. Operator : Our next question comes from Alessandro Abate with Berenberg. Alessandro Abate : I just have 2 quick questions. I mean, the market seems to be obsessed by the fact that China's steel price has come off quite a lot. And you, Mark, just have a contrarian view at the moment. Just to clear up the things from any kind of doubt related to your assumption, we're seeing the HRC is going down quite a lot in terms of ex imports to the U.S., with Korea and China completely almost disappearing. Beyond the advantage that you get from reduction of import of HRC, can you also support the view that the average steel price at import level from the rest of the exporter to the U.S. has significantly increased considering that the 2 most aggressive exporters are basically disappearing? And the second one is related to Mexico. I mean, the first indicator of the [indiscernible] risk of potential deterioration of U.S.-Mexico trade relationship is clearly the FX which has appreciated as of late. What is your view on domestic steel demand in Mexico for the next 6 months? Mark Millett : Well, I'll take the Mexican question first and I'll probably forget the first question by the time I finish that. The Mexico market, at least from our perspective, is still strong and growing. They have -- well, they're still short in a big way down there. They will continue to need imports. Just with the current assets in place, you can argue whether or not people are going to continue to build that. I think they will. But nonetheless, just the current assets in place there, the consumption will -- is strong and will continue to grow. And given our location of the Columbus sheet mill having one of the, if not one, the cheapest freight into Mexico, we're very, very well positioned to benefit and exploit that growth there. So I don't see an issue with Mexico. I think the administration has softened or kind of moderated its stance. There's a recognition that we need to be good trading partners. Maybe the NAFTA agreement should be modified. I think it's been around for a long time and I think both parties will benefit from a new look at that, but I think it's going to be a prudent, pragmatic review. So I don't have any concerns, any issues with trade with Mexico. The earlier question, I think, is kind of focused on the arbitrage between domestic pricing and Asian pricing. Obviously, on the hot-rolled coil side, essentially, the duties have shut China and a lot of those folks out of the marketplace.  We're seeing a little bit of hot-rolled coil coming from other folks, but again, year-over-year, hot-rolled coil import is down significantly. The import arena, that -- it's grown year-over-year. Again, we talked about it earlier. Total sheet and coated, there, the arbitrage has grown. But also, the demand in the States is very, very strong and you've got an industry that is pretty well maxed out today. So I'm not surprised to see a little expansion in those products. Theresa Wagler : If I can just quickly add, I think you made the point earlier and I think it's a very valid point that some people don't understand, there's an overfocus on China right now on hot-rolled coil prices, where if you look at European prices which they don't have the trade cases necessarily, those prices are still very high. And so to your point, the arbitrage there to bring those into the U.S. really isn't that attractive because their prices have remained much higher than China. Alessandro Abate : Just a quick follow-up. I mean, what I wanted to say is that considering China is off the market at the moment, also, South Korea has been shut down at the moment, I mean, the average import price that you have is significantly lower than what the China's export price would imply. So the effect of an arbitrage which is calculated between the U.S. HRC and China HRC, has lost a lot of power. Do you agree with that? Mark Millett : Sure. Absolutely. I totally agree. Operator : Our next question comes from Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Novid Rassouli : I had a question -- I think you touched on it in a previous question -- or a couple of the previous questions, Mark, but in last quarter's conference call, you'd mentioned that supply side tightness -- you're seeing supply side tightness on the sheet side and that you expect that to be sustained. I was wondering if you can just update us on how the market has evolved since then and your current thoughts and outlook. Mark Millett : Well, I, hopefully, articulated that to some degree already. The sheet arena, I think, just continues to be tight. It's somewhat balanced, I guess. You have a large sector of our industry not buying or hasn't really been buying and that's the service center industry and hence, inventories have shrunk as their shipments have increased. So I think generally, there's going to be a catch-up there over the next few months. And as I said earlier, I think the supply chain is in a precarious or at a precarious point. 1.8 months of flat-rolled products out there. I mean, it's almost unheard of.  And I would imagine that the folks are going to need -- if they're going to support the OEM customer when demand continues to grow, that industry needs to be restocked. So that onto itself is going to fuel additional demand. On top of that, demand in general, for us anyway, continues to grow. We're seeing market share growth in automotive. We're seeing growth in the energy arena. And I think it's just going to continue to go over the next couple of quarters, for sure. Novid Rassouli : Right. And just to touch on the low inventories, so pricing sentiment has definitely shifted basically in the past few weeks and so traditionally, we kind of see buyers pull back a bit. But given the low inventories, I mean, are you seeing any shift in buying activity from the shift in sentiment or -- and do you expect to? Mark Millett : I think we're seeing the typical profile and it's a little frustration -- frustrating, I guess, for us. But people try to anticipate where the scrap market is going and buy or order in relation to that. Again, we're not in a raw material or cost-driven environment today. We're in a supply side-driven environment. And I think we're going to see less and less of an impact of scrap here going forward on pricing. Well, we have seen a profile a couple of weeks or 3 weeks ago, folks took their feet off the order pedal a little bit and the scrap market didn't come off quite as strong as they anticipated. Pricing has not softened dramatically and we're starting to see the order rate pick back up again today. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Hacking with Citi Investment Research. Alexander Hacking : Just a couple of follow-up questions on end demand, you mentioned in the press release growth from large public sector infrastructure projects. Is this something that you're already seeing? And if so, could you give us some color? Or is this something that you're anticipating once an infrastructure bill will be put in place? And then secondly, just on energy sector, if I remember right, Mark, you talked about -- that this sector could maybe get back to kind of a 5 million ton per year rate. Where do you think we're in that process right now? Is there any way to quantify the improvement in demand from that sector? Mark Millett : Well, I think our conference in the [indiscernible] to the infrastructure is kind of relative to the potential build, build-out by the administration. I think we're seeing positive growth in nonresidential construction in general, though and it will continue. Theresa Wagler : I just might add to that, though. We're seeing movement at the state level that really has come prior to any federal infrastructure program and we have seen some positive signs from that. And we just have anecdotal information from [indiscernible] and whatnot that there is some positive movement there for infrastructure. Mark Millett : And on energy, I wouldn't be able to quantify, honestly, where we're at this moment in time, although I would suggest we're way down the curve and there's a huge runway to be attained here. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Sean Wondrack : I'm just trying -- I'm just going through some of the comments you were stating about imports. When we look at global crude steel production, right, it's up about 15 million metric tons year-over-year, with China being up about 11 million metric tons, at least through February. And then when you just look at global pricing, right, U.S. HRC is obviously the highest and then Chinese domestic HRC is obviously the lowest. And it's almost a $300 -- $270 difference at this point. What prevents -- so considering that service center is basically going through a buyer strike and, like you've been commenting, they haven't been buying, inventory levels have been getting very low, do you think they're expecting imports? Like are imports on the water since it takes 3 to 4 months to come over and they think they can just get around the tariffs? I know that service centers, a couple of them I've spoken to, put about 20% of their buy in offshore steel. So I was just kind of curious how you looked at that, thought about that dynamic. Mark Millett : I'm not aware of any threat on the hot-rolled coil side from anyone. I would suggest that essentially, the hot-rolled coil arena has been effectively shut down. Any thrust would be, again, on the cold-rolled sheet and coated side of the business, as we've said earlier. So that volume is somewhat limited. A lot of that material today are kind of what I call stocked stuff coming in, the 48-wide and 60-wide material. And as you have a supply chain inventory as tight as we're today, they don't have every size and gauge [indiscernible] that our customers or that the OEMs want. And so there's a natural need for stuff produced in the United States and I think we're at that kind of sort of balance point today. And we're not threatened. We don't feel threatened by any further imports there. Sean Wondrack : So that would kind of indicate that these service centers that have been buying imports would start buying American again which should be great for the market. So I guess we should look to see that in the coming quarters? Mark Millett : Well, it'd be good to see some of those folks be a little more patriotic than they are, yes. Operator : The next question comes from Aldo Mazzaferro with Macquarie. Aldo Mazzaferro : I just had 2 quick questions. In the pipe market, you got this Trump initiative that seems to be focusing on melted and poured steel in the U.S. rather than rolled slabs and things like that. And I'm wondering, I think a lot of the steel that gets sold to the pipe market is coming from slabs that might be imported. I'm wondering whether you see an opportunity [indiscernible], especially with some of those pipe mills that are sitting around Texas that are underutilized [indiscernible] more materials. Is there kind of a big story in your hot-rolled coil business going to the energy that might be further accelerated by the melt-and-pour [indiscernible]? Barry Schneider : Aldo, this is Barry Schneider. I would tell you that in recent meetings we've had with the administration and Department of Commerce, the pipe manufacturing in the United States have had troubles on their own in competing on a level playing field across the world. So in many cases, the materials they can get here in the United States, they are capable of vast majority of products that would be consumed here. But in some cases, when hot-rolled is coming in subsidized in the shape of a pipe or energy sector product, it's very difficult to compare or to compete with that. So we did -- we were excited to hear that the administration was considering the standard melted and poured kind of language for Buy American projects. We think that is a good utilization of American business and helping to level that playing field for people that make those products. But that will regard primarily intrastate business. So interstate business, we have to convince people we have the right products and earn that business. But this helps us through that by leveling the playing field and allowing the domestic manufacturers to have what they need, supply it right here in [indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro : Great. And then kind of a second question on the topic of [indiscernible], any strategy on scrap? [indiscernible] some of the assets you made to traditional lines earlier, is that mostly third-party material that you [indiscernible] by your ratio of internal [indiscernible] versus the previous in terms of the amount of scrap you sell internally versus outsiders? Barry Schneider : Those yards were kind of on the periphery and certainly not within the shadow of our steel mills. So the scrap that did go from those yards had a big freight bill on it to get to our steel mills. So naturally, scrap is going to flow to the most logical freight home in most cases. So again, that -- those assets were better suited for somebody else. Aldo Mazzaferro : Great. So Russ, is your strategy on scrap to try to stay slightly long, selling to the market? Or do you think you'll gravitate eventually towards self-sufficiency? Russel Rinn : I think it's a combination of both, although I think our primary role is to make sure we've got the right scrap for our steel mills at the right price. That's our no. one priority, [indiscernible]. Aldo Mazzaferro : Sorry. It looks like if you had one more mill, you'd probably be there. Russel Rinn : Getting close. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Fields with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Matthew Fields : Just a couple of smaller things and then one sort of bigger picture. What kind of auto sheet products are you making at Columbus? Barry Schneider : We continue to develop new products all the time, but we do sell advanced high-strength steels to market as well as traditional galvanized and high-strength steel members. We continue out of our Butler facility. Actually, we've been growing with our automotive team. We've been growing the participation out of Butler. And in many cases, it's lighter products that the mill's suited for. Down at Columbus, on the coated side, we do have much more capability there. The galvanizing lines were designed for some of these more modern steel applications. So we try not to get too far ahead of ourselves and we're trying to respond to what the automakers are asking us to do. And right now, that works well for the whole product mix. And as you may know, we do not do exposed automotive, but we do a vast majority of other parts of the automotive, what's going into an automobile. So we look forward to adding these newer products, but we're always trying to make sure that we're doing the best thing with our assets we can and communicating with the automakers to find where they need us to be. So it's a changing world in this steel. It's really exciting. It really is interesting metallurgically, of course, but for our product mix, it's great, as Mark said, to diversify us. Matthew Fields : And then I think Theresa mentioned one of the bigger -- one of the surprising drivers of growth this quarter was mining equipment out of Pittsboro maybe specifically or maybe sort of company-wide. But can you talk about those kinds of products, customers, what kind of equipment you were supplying? Glenn Pushis : Sure. This is Glenn Pushis. Most of those products go into our forging applications, so it will be sold to forge houses that then support the oil patch. So couplings, different forge applications for different types of machinery. Matthew Fields : So it's more oil and gas than it is for actual mining? Glenn Pushis : There's a little bit of mining. I consider Caterpillar to be mining, so yellow goods have picked up a little bit. Matthew Fields : Okay. And then lastly, I think Timna asked the question about inorganic growth and you're pretty helpful on that. I know you can't sort of give away the store here, but now that you're 1.0x net leveraged which is of lowest you've been in a very long, long time, would you be willing to sort of flex your balance sheet to go after something bigger on the downstream side? Mark Millett : Absolutely. I think we recognize where we're and I think we have the -- and we've been -- we've done here intentionally to build a platform or a foundation for significant growth and I think we will take advantage of that. That being said, we continue to reassess where we're and our sort of cash allocation [indiscernible]. Theresa Wagler : So Matt, just to calibrate a little bit, when we talk about kind of the framework for looking at the balance sheet and the capital structure, we really gear toward net leverage of less than 3x through cycle. So with that, you can see that we've, to Mark's point, really prepared for a pretty significant growth opportunity, whether that's downstream or otherwise, as Mark mentioned earlier. Matthew Fields : And then would you sort of prefer a pipe and tube manufacture that's on the structural side or maybe a more energy-focused tubular producer? Mark Millett : We're looking for opportunities that will improve our sort of margin profile, that provides pull-through volume for us. Well, again, 3 avenues or 3 focus areas, as I said earlier. It's downstream, sort of value-add processing-type capability, pull-through volume, so some form of manufacturing to draw material through based on the model of New Millennium, based on the model of Vulcan, on the sort of threaded run out of Pittsboro and also just steel assets themselves. Matthew Fields : When you say steel assets themselves, you mean like a new mill? Mark Millett : Or existing mills that we believe we can infuse with our culture and our business model to improve their earnings profile. Operator : Our next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : I just realized the call's been going on for an hour and 10 minutes and nobody's asked the typical one-of-the-first questions I ever usually ask, short term modeling-type question. How should we be thinking about volume sequentially overall and margins per ton sequentially overall in the second quarter versus the first quarter? Theresa Wagler : Well, Dave, this is Theresa and Mark's smiling very broadly and pointing at me, so I can be the bad guy. Clearly, we want to focus long term. And so I think Mark said at the profile, right now, we do expect and I think you can take whatever you want without maybe too prescriptive, but we're expecting demand to continue to increase in the various areas that we discussed. We're going to say steady. We definitely see in a positive trend. From a perspective of spreads, we do believe that the supply side really is driving flat roll pricing today versus the cost side. So one would suggest that given supply is still very tight, that would be a very constructive view on pricing for flat rolls. We're expecting to see continued construction which should help support the long products side of the equation as well as the energy market. And scrap, we believe, should stay pretty steady and moderate. You'll have [indiscernible] months here and there, but we can't predict those. Long term, if you look at the supply and the demand environment, there's no reason why there's a significant driver for it to go either significantly higher or significantly lower. So you can -- you could take from that what you will and I'm sorry, I'm not being more prescriptive. I'm sure everyone would like us to be so. David Gagliano : No, that's perfect. That's very helpful. Very much appreciate the longer term approach and also what seems to me to be very encouraging, supportive commentary regarding the outlook for the market here. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Super. Well, thank you, Rob. And again, many thanks for sharing your time with us today. We do value you as we do our customers. Any customers on the line, we'd like to certainly thank you for your support. And to our employees, I tell you, guys and girls, you did a phenomenal job in the quarter. It's you that drives the company's success and will continue to drive it forward in the future. So it's an honor to be with you all. So take care. Have a great day. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia, and good morning everybody. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call and thank you for sharing your time with us today. I'd first like to thank the entire rest of my team for strong performance this past quarter and also express my sincere appreciation to our customers for their continued loyalty and support. We wouldn\u2019t be who we are without you. As usual, I'd ask Theresa to begin with the comments related to our financial results. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I'd also like to recognize the efforts across the Company, delivering a really solid performance in the second quarter. Our net income was $154 million or $0.63 per diluted share which is squarely within our range between $0.60 and $0.64. This compares to net income of $142 million or $0.58 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016 and $201 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the sequential quarter. Second quarter 2017 revenues were on par with sequential first quarter sales at $2.4 billion, based on higher average steel selling value making up for a lower shipment. Our operating income for the second quarter decreased 21% to $265 million compared to the sequential first quarter. The decrease in earnings was primarily driven by our flat roll operations, as increased average scrap cost outpaced average sales price growth. Additionally, as mentioned in our mid-quarter guidance, we upgraded and expanded one of our galvanizing mines at our Butler Flat Roll Division, which required a three week average in May, increasing expenses and reducing value added shipments. The Columbus Flat Roll Division experienced some startup issues as well in the paint line, which also increased expenses and decreased value-added flat roll shipments in the quarter. Combined these two events, reduced potential second quarter of 2017 pretax earnings by an estimated $30 million. For the second quarter, operating income from our steel operations declined $79 million or 22% to $274 million, a result of metal spread compression and some mixed shift within the Flat Roll Group, coupled with lower long product shipment. Our average quarterly steel selling price increased $36 per ton to $779 in the second quarter. However, our average scrap cost increased $39 per ton to $303. For the second quarter 2017, total steel shipments decreased to 2.4 million tons about 2%. Flat roll shipment stayed steady, however, the mixed shift is a rough value-added sales based on the galvanizing added. Long product steel volumes declined 8%, primarily driven by lower structural and merchant steel shipment, as increased imports continued to pressure domestic buyers. Our metals recycling platform bears scrap shipment decreased 9% and metal spread also compressed. Demand was down slightly in the quarter, but primarily that driver of lower volume was in March 2017 sale of some of our non-core Southeastern U.S. location. Despite the metal spread compression, the team did a great job continuing to optimize costs throughout the business, resulting in a second quarter 2017 operating income of $20 million well aligned with the strong first quarter performance of 21 million. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically integrated model, benefiting both steel mills and the scrap operations. Metal recycling continues to maintain a higher-than-historical percentage of total internal ferrous shipments to support SDI steel mills at 62% in the second quarter. Our fabrication operations achieved record shipments for the second consecutive quarter, a continued indicator that the non-residential construction market is improving. Order backlog also remains very robust. Part of the second 2017 operating income from our fabrication operations decreased sequentially to $20 million, a decline of 15% due to metal spread compression only the higher average steel input cost, which obviously benefited our average. During the second quarter 2017, we generated cash flows and operations of $81 million, lower than the 240 during the first quarter, primarily related to acquire $152 million estimated tax payment that was related to the entire first half of the year. During the first half of '17, we generated cash flow from operations of $321 million with operational working capital growing by 234 million, based on market improvement. We maintained our cash dividend for the second quarter at $0.155 per share and we repurchased a $138 million of our common stock during the first half of the year pursuant to our board-authorized program. We believe these assets reflect the strength of our capital structure and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. At June 30, 2017, we maintained liquidity of $2.1 million comprised of our undrawn revolver and available cash of $909 million. Second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $350 million of trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA at a record $1.4 billion. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with strong profile capital structure, provides great opportunity for our continued organic and inorganic growth. We\u2019re squarely focused on the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. And before I pass it back to Mark, I know there are few of you that view some different categories of shipment for flat roll in your model. So for the second quarter, our hot roll and P&L shipments were 940,000 tons, our cold roll shipments were 138,000 tons and our total shipments were 685,000 tones. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. Thanks for articulating especially some phenomenal financial results there. I think the team has done incredibly well. As I said in the past, the welfare of our employees remains our number one priority and nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance remains significantly better than the industry averages, and we continue to work toward a zero incident environment. And I would tell you that the team is doing a phenomenal outstanding job. So for this year, we reduced our total recordable injury rate by 22% and 79% of our locations there incidents-free. I applaud the entire SDI team for their dedication and continued focus. They truly are an outstanding growth. The steel platform performed well in the second quarter. Our production utilization was 91%, once again markedly better than the estimated domestic industry rate of 74% and in large part due to having one of the most diversified and value-added product profiles in the industry. The demand from the automotive sector remains steady, and the construction and energy sector continues to improve. Energy still has a long way to go, but we're definitely seeing a very positive demand trend. In May, we upgraded the hot roll organizing line at both of the double flat roll division, adding 180,000 tons of value-added coating capability for a capital investment of only $15 million. The additional capacity will benefit the second half of this year. We also continue to ramp up with production of a new paint line of the Columbus Flat Roll Division, which initiated prime shipment in the first quarter of this year. The new line provides 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and further diversification into some our highest margin products. We have two existing paint lines in Indiana, but this new line fully state-of-the-art facility, allowing for high quality in HVAC in our clients products, double-wide steel and facilitate access to the Southern U.S. and Mexican markets. The team did experience some quality related issues with aid to an equipment failure in the second quarter, which is quickly identified and is temporary contained with the final solution being planned to September. Columbus continues to be a significant earnings catalyst. The changes that the team has already made are transformational and I believe there is still more to come. The success for market and product diversification that was achieved over the last two years is one of the key differentiators for our improved profitability and we will continue to benefit coming year as well. Domestically, flat roll steel production utilization remained much higher than long product utilization. Flat roll steel benefitted from steady demand, coupled with an improved supply dynamics. Customers inventory levels remained at historical lows, however, value-added flat roll imports continue to increase. And compared to last year, cold roll and galvanized flat roll steel imports at 32% higher. Additionally, pipe and tube import continues to grow up 75% year-to-date. The slight continued numbers residential construction growth, structural emerging steel shipments declined in the quarter, driven by elevated input levels of both structural beam and prefabricated steel products. Although, our total quarterly production utilization rate was 91%, our long product divisions operated though at run rate 70% while meaning section structural beam only operated at 50% to 55% of its capacity. In coverage length, the Engineered Bar Products Division continues to see excellent momentum and operate at 70% of its current capacity, compare to just over 50% in '15 and '16, not only that we see improved demand for managing general instruments, but the division is also benefitting from internal supply to our recently acquired Vulcan bar operations. In aggregate, we still have over 1 million tons of unused steel shipping capability, but most of the late in capacity and construction related that could potentially be consumed by infrastructure and large civil engineering products. Our steel platform has several other earnings catalyst. Our recently announced 75% expansion of our Structural and Rail Division will utilize existing access metal and casting capability and further diversifying our product portfolio and market sector exposure. This project provides for the annual production of 240,000 tons of reinforcing bar including coil, custom cut to length and smooth bar. Our internal business model should substantially enhance the current supply-chain, providing meaningful time, yield loss and working capital benefits for the customers. In addition, it will be the largest independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region. Additionally, our Vulcan operation will also provide pull-through volume opportunity for this project. Vulcan currently consumes between 30,000 to 40,000 tons of smooth coil by annually. In aggregate, we should see a material improvement in future through cycle utilization at our structural division. We expect to be in operations with this new line by the end of 2018. We're also investing $28 million to utilize excess smelting and casting capability at our Roanoke Bar Division. We're adding equivalent that will allow to multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing of 200,000 tons. Similar to our Midwest investment, we expect to have strong market penetration as we will be the only independent producer reinforcing bar in the Virginia area as well. We expect to begin operations of this line at the end of 2017. The profitability of our metals recycling platform remain well aligned with strong first quarter results, quite low fair scrap shipments and metal spread in the second quarter, as the team continues to optimize administrative and operating cost. Even though, we have realigned some of the scrap assets after the March 2017 sale of some Southeastern U.S. locations, we're still reorganizing and expect some additional cost savings during 2017. We anticipate a continuation of the relatively strong U.S. dollar and good scrap flows, supporting ample scrap supply and more stabilized scrap price environment through the second half of the year. The fabrication platform continues strong performance, achieving a second consecutive quarter of record shipments and ending the quarter with a record high in order backlog. The team continues to achieve great market penetration in both choice and depth. Our fabrication operations purchased 330,000 tons of steel from SDI mills in 2016 and are on track to continue to purchase meaningful quantities in 2017. The power pull-through volume and fabrication sources steel from our own mills is a significant advantage to keeping our steel platform utilization rates higher through in weaker demand environments. The new millennium team continues to perform exceptionally well, levering our national footprint and providing quality product. The ongoing strength of this business and continued customer optimism also provides a very positive insight into the continued strength in non-residential construction activity. The steady growing steel demand, low supply chain inventories and a current trade cases in place the flat roll supply demand environment is positive. However, unfairly traded steel imports remains to be a concern, as certain foreign producers circumvent the existing trade laws as evidenced by recent increased import volume Despite imports, we continue to have a positive beyond the domestic steel consumption. Domestic automotive production may be edging off record levels, but we believe total net production will grow as Mexico continues to grow production with the current assets in place. This is obviously and very highly complementary to our Columbus division's automotive strategy. We believe it will be continued to growth from the construction center especially for the large public sector infrastructure projects, which would greatly benefit our long products group. We also anticipate continued improvement within the energy sector. I think our results say it all, but our business model and execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our industry competition. Customer focus coupled with market diversification and low cost operating platforms, supports our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance and differentiation. The Company and the team are poised for continued growth and are incredibly excited. The strong character and determination of our employees provides the foundation for our success. And I thank each and every one of them for their hard work and dedication and remind them safety is always our first priority. We seem to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, employees and shareholders alike and look forward to creating new opportunities for all in the years ahead. So, again, thank you for your time today and Melissa, we love to open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Loop Capital. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy : You guys have mentioned energy on a couple of different occasion, how much you'd substrate, in terms of sheet goes into the welded pipe business? And I mean you mentioned that sort of extra million tons. It sounds like construction and energy are the targets there, talk about kind of what you're seeing in demand for both of those end markets? Mark Millett : I think our exposure to energy is lot lower today than it was when we first bought Columbus in end of 201. Obviously, as we said in the past and did today, the team has done a tremendous job of transforming that product mix away from energy. That being said we\u2019re still participating in the pipe and tube arena. Barry and his team were focused on the higher grades there, not just the basic line pipe, but the highest strength grades that will accrue us greater margin. But Theresa, where are we actually, percentagewise? Do you know? Brett Levy : Got it. All right. And then, let\u2019s see, we put our report in July on a competitor of yours who has exact same rating since yours, I am a bond guy, BA to BB plus. If you look at the credit states, even the ratings are same and they are very strong, they are much stronger and then we look against the largest competitor you have. Your credit states tend to look more like BA1 single and minus, which is their rating. And I'm thinking, if you look at cash debt net debt EBITDA interest equity market cap and how all them relate to each other. Isn\u2019t it time for you guys to be investment-grade because you look like it? Theresa Wagler : Worth smiling in handing over to me, Brett. Brett Levy : I'm sorry. Theresa Wagler : No worries. No, you're fully correct with that credit metric, I mean, we're very proud of those. We\u2019re also in a unique environment where growth is still very much as a forefront, not just all unique but transactional as well. So I think that as we move in we've always said that we were very happy being where we were because we were treated very much like IG, but we actually were progressed to IG just because of our business model and I think we\u2019re probably approaching that time line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Korn : So, it sounds like you anticipating fairly, steady maybe modestly improving demand environment on the net, over the second half. So first, is that a fair read? And then second, it seems like consensus thinking right now the market is that no matter what may or may not be announced policy-wise. It's being kind of an anticipatory freezing out of the import orders now that could drive a tighter market and the supply side, as we get into late summer and early fall. I wonder that's your expectation too and if that gets you even on its own excited about the pricing prospects over the second half? Mark Millett : To answer your first question, absolutely, we're excited and very, very optimistic to the second half and not just the second half or going into 2018. I think the environment has turned and we are going to continue to see growth. If you look at flat roll and just thinking about the markets a part a little bit to answer your second question. The flat roll arena, I think remains very strong despite a slight turning of automotive. As we look internally, auto rate is absolutely solid and strong there. Our lead times are right where we want them to be, right about 3 weeks to 4 weeks for coil and 5 weeks and 6 weeks for value-add. And it is just a very positive environment there, obviously, makeover came like with some of the $25 uptick in pricing, and I think the industry will likely hold at and the environment will admit to lower that at this state. The input numbers, obviously, inputs continue to come in and these are the inputs that have been ordered month, two months, three months and prior. The new input offerings I think through drive some event and then most for those in hold offerings in fact like the maturity of those offerings. The trade is the shifting the risk of any particular two actions to the customer. And I don't think to be honest that there are too many customers as they are wondering to take on any potential liability for the tariffs. So I think end of Q3 going to Q4, the actual input arrivals are going to drive that, I don't know whether they're going to drive that totally, but they are going to be substantially back. So, generally a very, very, very I think positive pricing environment. Construction continues to its incremental growth and I do believe and we can certainly take the advantage of that and we feel obviously is a very, very positive tailwind. So I think I agree with you. It's a very positive environment relative to just the sheet. You should look at the environment now you've got rising prices in Asia. We are appreciating all and kind of an appreciating a global cost curve. We've got positive demand trends in the U.S. It was incredibly lower inventory. It's almost astonishing, but the inventory is low as they are given the potential tightness that it's right there on the horizon. And I think that's a positive environment onto itself than on top of that and you create action from Section 232 or any implementation of the trade restraint is just a icing on the cake to drive that higher. So a very, very positive outlook, I would suggest. We are excited. Matthew Korn : Thanks Mark. Can you us give us any color at all on what you're looking to have to do on the permanent fix versus the temporary fix for the new lines there at Columbus? And then I'll hand over it, thanks. Mark Millett : Essentially, the issue was in this, what we call the snout that delivers the -- and protects the strip, the heating strip going into the galvanizing part, and we need to keep that in a very special, at a special temperature and also in a protected environment. The failure related to just bad design and bad construction of that snout, but the guys got in there, they fixed it. So, temporarily, there is not an issue. The problems have gone away and a brand new, I mean, Barry is delivering in September. Barry Schneider : In the near future, it should be here for installation in September. Mark Millett : In September. Theresa Wagler : But Matt, there shouldn't be any incremental costs or outages related to that. So we're trying to think about whether or not that would isolate to second quarter. That was isolated in the second quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : Just wanted to be completely clear that the 30 million impact, you talked about in as a result of some of the upgrades that you did in the first half are entirely behind you, and like run rate wise to exclude those is a reasonable way to look into the second half? Theresa Wagler : Timna, yes, absent any differential market changes those were the things -- the $30 million for both Butler and Columbus is isolated the second quarter. Timna Tanners : Okay super. And then just wanted to take a step back and ask you a little bit more philosophical question about capital allocation. I think Steel Dynamics has a great track record for organic growth and investing first in projects internally, but it just has me a little bit concerned seeing the capacity growth, in rebar capacity growth, in galvanized. You know, you're not the only one that's adding right, CMC's adding rebar, and Nucor is adding galvanized. And I'm just concerned, why the build over by at this point in the cycle, we've seen this play out with SBQ before where everybody added at the top of the market. Can you just give us a little bit more explanation as kind of why you're approaching the market in build versus buy? Mark Millett : Well, the first and foremost, these projects are incredibly -- they're incredible users of capital, effective use of capital. If you talk about, how we're galvanizing line, we're adding 180,000 tons of new capability of $15 million. You compare that efficiency or effectiveness against building a new line or any other competition out there, I mean, it's just the right thing to do. Relative to rebar and maybe those ones a little bit wide, I'll share your thoughts, but again it's incredibly constructive use of capital, it's effective. Getting 200,000 tons or utilizing 200,000 tons of the excess smelt capacity at Roanoke is just the compression of the additional volume across all fronts. That's concerned onto itself. And similarly for the Structural and Rail Division, in aggregate, we're looking at roughly 400,000 - 450,000 tons rebar which is probably only 5% of the domestic market. But as we've done in the past, if you look at our paint line investments, rail investments, those investments were made in markets that won\u2019t necessarily supply short, but we ended those markets differentiating ourselves, differentiating with the supply chain. And I believe we're doing same thing here. Firstly, we're the -- we'll be the only principal independent manufacturer of rebar of notes. And so, there are massive numbers of what they call independent rebar fabricators that don\u2019t necessarily like buying the input material from their competition. Obviously, you get there CMC, Nucor are large producers of rebar. They are also large fabricators, competing with that their independent ways. So, we think we're going to be received well imports of that 2 million tons of that 9 million ton market today. And that\u2019s ample opportunity to penetrate the market wise. And in the Midwest, rebar is efficient on a supply side, so there is a trade advantage that we believe we have there. And more importantly, we'll be producing spooled, straight and spooled rebar. Spooled rebar, if you got to Europe, spooled rebar is the product of choice because of the effectiveness and efficiency of its use and reduction of yield loss. So, we -- some folks utilize spooled rebar in the states at a lower premium, but more importantly this we're hopefully going to change the supply chain somewhat. We got inventory of that spooled bar and actually give the customers kind of a customized cut length short or quick sheet order-ability. That takes a lot of time, takes a lot of working capital and takes a huge amount of yield loss out of the supply chain for that. And we believe, we'll create sufficient value to allow us to penetrate that market without too much flow. Timna Tanners : Okay. That\u2019s a really helpful explanation. Just last one, just a follow-up if you wouldn\u2019t mind on this Section 232 not ask you to speculate, but assuming, but there are some sort of prohibitive traffic and some sort of reduction particularly on the flat roll side, and the mini mills are already running pretty full out there. What kind of response do you think Steel Dynamics could contemplate, if there were more restrictions and ability gain market share? We\u2019re going to see just the integrated free start capacity. Do you think there is any ability for mini mills to also respond with more capacity? Thanks. Mark Millett : I think our utilization right now is pretty good, as you indicate, but the product mix that we have today is not necessary ideal or doesn't necessary maximize our margin opportunity. Part of the issues has been the sort of the whack-a-mole effect out there. The principal problem is the massive excess capacity in China and hope that drives the just imports in general. Good work was done in 2015 to come up with a trade cases particularly on cover sheet and coated, but since then and after those cases were implemented, we did see a drop off in volume. It did diminish yet it's picked up, in the first half of this year as we said. You've seen greater cover sheet and coated imports than you did prior to the trade cases being implemented, and that's countries like Vietnam, for instance. In 2015, they shift about 50,000 tons of coated into the America and 16 that was closure to 700,000 and 800,000 tons. A lot of that product was galvanneal paint, which totally impacts or directly impacts our line adjustment deal and our new line in Columbus. So for us, it may or it may not be a massive increase in volume, but certainly it will allow us to maximize our margin opportunity as to which products we take the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jorge Beristain : On 232 to beat a dead horse, I was just wondering, if given that the steel industries again have recent meetings with, Ross. If you guys could comment about what is the hold up in getting this thing out? Mark Millett : Well, I think we will be as you said, we're beating a dead horse maybe and I think it's -- there is a lot of speculation either as what's the cases, what the recommendations might be and when it's going to come out. Having spent some time in Washington and spent time with the decision makers. There is obviously politics to play and a lot of things we've got to satisfy. And I think the very encouraging aspect is you got the administration or the players. Secretary Ross, in particular, is incredibly engaged. I would tell you he absolutely understands the issues, all the issues, very broadly. And he's going to take a very prudent approach, a very strong approach in this recommendation to the President. I'm encouraged. So, it takes an extra week or two to get it done. Again, I think they're right there wanting to present a case that it's going to be positive and successful, and gain some support on the hill, such that we don\u2019t keep listening to that than dilute the strength of it. But, I again, I'm in personally met with them very, very encouraged that action is going to be taken, and it's going to be benefit in the industry. Jorge Beristain : Okay. And just at a company level for you guys. Could you comment on your $36 quarter-on-quarter increase in average realizations, in your steel ups and that's despite the fact that you had lower value-added in flat roll due to your outrages at Butler and the quality issues at Columbus? Could you just kind of comment what's happened with product mix that you did so well quarter-on-quarter despite those issues? Theresa Wagler : Right, if you look at the product pricing or the product mix, what you do is you see some of the shifts more to the longer, long product side, and you see that the mix related to I believe, SBQ was higher as well. And so with that, you just have higher pricing on a long product side, and so that's why were they were offset some of the galvanized from lower end from Columbus. Mark Millett : Okay, I think just to add more color there because as I talked about the markets, I fail to mention our Engineered Bar Division. That's an arena, as I said before at least as a -- and it gives me a sense of the broader market that it's in or especially every single sector of the marketplace. There things have taken off. The order input rate is absolutely dramatically improved to a point where we're almost, perhaps we're almost on a right orders to some degree. So that arena is incredibly strong. Energy is very, very strong. We're into the same skewed markets there in energy. Automotive for us is actually despite the tail off in -- slight tail off in production maybe in north U.S. We're gaining market share there. The caterpillars, off-road equipment guys, their forecasts or -- their forecasts or actual order rates, they're exceeding the forecast by an appreciable amount, coat finishes strong. That's just manufacturing slowdown. So that gives me a very-very positive outlook as to just fuel consuming economy is general. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alessandro Abate with Berenberg. Please proceed with your question. Alessandro Abate : Mark and Theresa, good morning, and there was decent set of results, I mean, I just have one question that's either related to we just said before hand, related to your deal product mix. If you assume the current utilization rates across your mills, could you be able to give me -- to give a little more color by how long it will take you to achieve this ideal mix with current market conditions. By how much, if you can of course disclose, would you able to increase your operating margin relative to today's point of view? And the second one, I mean, since all my colleagues have asked about the Section 232, what is your perception that the steel used for, for example, the all oil sector that is a strategic, considered strategic in the U.S. may be benefited from this Section 232? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Related to the optimal product mix, I'm not sure I can equate to an actual margin improvement and I stated the optimal mix is going to be, as we start to see the improvement in Engineered Bar, which Mark mentioned, and which I've been fairly extraordinary. That's obviously very helpful, but we still have a value-added improvement that we need to make down at Columbus. They're continuing to get certified on new products, more difficult products by enlarging value-added products. They're also still ramping up in the paint line. Pain line likely because some of those products need to be certified, likely not to get to full capacity, yet in 2017 we'll see that, I'll say probably first half of 2018 with their continuing to do great things there. So, there's still quite a value-added shift at Columbus. There's still room at Engineered Bar and what we do at our specialty shapes mill in steel West Virginia, they're actually adding some new value-added galvanizing, just galvanizing capacity as well, which will come online in September. So, there's still quite a bit of room for us to move, but I would suggest you probably don\u2019t see that until sometime next year. And in addition to that, I think we keep talking about 232, and Mark will answer your last question. But I think sometimes, we're missing the fact that it could also impact more products and while product is where we're seeing a lot of the imports from the structural or prefabricated sites. And if you were to see that come through in 232, that can be hugely impactful in a positive way for structural beams and for merchants shapes and for those things that, right now, the industry is, has not added a high utilization for it. Mark Millett : I didn\u2019t catch quite the question on the two, Theresa. Alessandro Abate : Could you hear me? Theresa Wagler : Yes, please go Alexander. Alessandro Abate : Yes, basically related to the Section 232, I mean, there is still a little bit of uncertainty and lack of clarity related to what kind of sectors beyond probably the most likely, Navy and Army. But how do you think that\u2019s -- about the chance that the steel used, for example, for the oil industry which is strategic anyway for the U.S. could be subject to the Section 232. What\u2019s your expectation about it/ Mark Millett : I think there one can automatically expect with this because you don\u2019t know what recommendations will finally be made and acted upon. There are three principal areas that of concerned and focused for us and for the industry. Two mostly the industry in generally we've been putting one and particular recently, but those two obviously, the first is to bring broad kind of resistance to imports on sheet side to prevent the circumvention issues, the whack-a-mole issues. And the issues is not to eliminate imports, the issue is just to curve them to kind of historic level of 21% to 22% of demand. At that level the industry can and should prosper and be able to earn its cost of capital. So, we're not proposing at least SDI, Mark know it. It's not proposed. We eliminate the imports because the manufacturing base doesn\u2019t have to be supportive. So, sheet is the one focus. The second focus and its related to energy and that\u2019s the pipe, as energy has come back or even before energy was coming back, 60% of pipe imports were or 60% of demand was satisfied by imports, largely from Korea. And as the energy is trended up, that percentage of that volume is only increased. And so that I think is going to be a focus. That is obviously to the benefit of the domestic industry in energy pipe used to be about 8%, 9%, 10% of the demand. So that will help the hot roll coil sector of our business, which is probably the one that there is challenged of weakness, that\u2019s the area. The third focus and something that we've been working on very, very strongly, as Theresa mentioned is actually structural's. In 2016, there were million tons of what I call straight stick, just basic long, heavy structural beams imported, but a growing factor is prefabricated beam that is grown dramatically over last four years. And again it's kind of the whack-a-mole thing where China and other sort of going down stream. But there is about 1.8 million tons of prefabricated structurals that come in to our shores, we have to add to together, we got about two point, about 2.5 million to 3 million tons of imports and in that market is probably 6 million to 7 million tons in round numbers. That's a huge, huge percentage of demand being satisfied by those inputs. As we've seen it, seen non-residential construction growth, the past two or three years, I think as much of that has been absorbed by the inputs. And we haven't seen the increased utilization within our beam heavy structural analysis and that's not just SDI. I believe that's Gerdau and also Nucor. So that is a conservative focus for us and I believe that is being addressed or likely to be addressed by the 232. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Sean Wondrack : So firstly I just like to reiterate the first gentleman said about your company is having closer to hygiene metrics than higher yield. Given your lack of secured debt in terms interest coverage, it seems a little silly at this point. But more than that, have you guys actually been in discussion with the ratings agencies about improving your credit rating, your outlook? Theresa Wagler : We aren\u2019t always -- we have a very open dialogue with both agencies, and it's a quite constructive dialogue, and up until it is very strong. We really told that we've told that you as a investor as well and we've been very happy with where we're rating for different regions because of our growth profile. But again as I said earlier on the call given where we are, we also view that eventually we would grow into just naturally being investment grade we kind of our business model and the strength of the cash flow generation. And so, I'd just say that there is something that we're constantly looking at and having dialogue with the agency in the past. Sean Wondrack : Great. And then just one comment, that you made earlier, Theresa, about transactional versus organic growth, I mean, for any other measure it would like you guys could potentially be considering an acquisition, you guys have been very acquisitive in the past. You have latent capacity that you can put to use. Are you seeing more M&A opportunities kind of rise in the market? I know you've seems some transactions recently, but is that's been something that's been coming more to the forefront recently? Mark Millett : So, it's always been the forefront of our focus internally here at Steel Dynamics. And I think I've said on previous calls, we have had a plethora of opportunities that we looked at over the last 12 months to 18 months, at all different sizes, but some very, very meaningful size type acquisitions. And that pipeline continues to be full. Opportunities continue to present themselves to us. Sean Wondrack : Okay. That's helpful and then quick follow-up. Should you undertake an acquisition, is there a ceiling above which you would want to keep a leverage below? And is there you know would you potentially is equity or would you consider earnings all with debt? Theresa Wagler : Our preference is still to be using at a considerable amount of caution our balance sheet and taxes revolver. So, with that and with our choice to achieve debt and cash as much as possible and not some a little bit shareholder base. No, it's necessary or whether it makes sense or not from that leverage perspective where we're today or even saying that we'd like to keep that leverage at three times or less. And obviously, we have a lot of room for an acquisition given that we're about one time of that. Sean Wondrack : And given that you generate like 750 million in free cash flow. That's very helpful, thank you very much, I appreciate you answering my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Novid Rassouli : Hey, Mark and Theresa, it's Novid. So with customer inventory levels as low as they are, as you mentioned early in the call Mark, and if essential Section 232 proposal being imminent in a couple of weeks out. Are you seeing any change in behavior from your customers? Mark Millett : Historically no, to be honest, and again, we're not a nice face, we're here to sell products to everyone and not control the business. But it seems amazing that, if you look at the probability and that's all you can do is, look at the probability of where markets are going and whether they will or will not be tight. The probability to me is sideways to up. And you would think there would be some form of restocking or inventory growth, but we've not seen it. Novid Rassouli : Okay, and so given these very-very low inventory levels. Do you see the potential for you know some serious pricing dislocation happening on a Section 232 proposal that is you know materially prohibitive to imports? Mark Millett : I think that there will be some initial emotional response. It may not be just emotional. It'd be just I think fairly tight supply when everyone rushes back into the market place, which will give you the spike. I do think that would then sort of reflect back to a more normalized number. That number is likely to be higher than what it is today. But I would hope not extreme to just sort of dislocated markets, yet again and go into a cycle. Novid Rassouli : Right, but as you mentioned to Timna's question, it's not really additional volume that you guys will be targeting. It\u2019s going to be a mix. So there won\u2019t be much relief from a volume standpoint for you guys to help the market. Theresa Wagler : Look, Novid, but now you're just talking about flat roll again. And so when look at 232 given the value of 1 million tons and more than 0.5 million tons of capacity, we're not meeting today that's on the long product side. What I would say, piece is in place today that could be quite significant. So I think you need to look at it. We look at it more broadly in just flat roll. Mark Millett : But to answer your point, it's reasonable to think that some capacity might come back to offset with the losses because again the sheet will -- flat roll utilization stays today is probably 90% plus. And so if you take you know a few million tons of imports off the table then you're going to likely see a little additional mix, new lines like, cutting lines, like the Nucor's announcement and big revenues going to be ramping their production up. We obviously have got 180,000 tons that we will bring into the market place. I think that can be observed into the market without any sort of downward disruption. Novid Rassouli : Right and then my last question, the switching gears. The 70% utilization on Engineering Bar, is that on the like one to three inch diameter or given that you mentioned energy and general industry, are there some wider diameters that are helping push that utilization rate higher? Mark Millett : I think the utilization is across both lines. The large bar line is full and then small bar is where we're having the large utilization. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : So a question on volume momentum into the third quarter and what's your preliminarily anticipating for volumes in 3Q versus the second quarter? Mark Millett : Not to be specific, so the directionally through the second half, Phil, I would suggest that the volumes should improve over the second quarter. I think the pricing environment that I kind of try to articulate would suggest positive momentum, so only support for pricing. And as we seen in the past, there will be some noise on scrap here up and down a little bit, but we see that being relatively stable through the second half of the year. Phil Gibbs : I appreciate that. And you made a lot of internal investments and a lot of announcements here in the last several months. Can you give us an update on your capital expenditures for this year and perhaps next? Theresa Wagler : For this year's total, Phil, we still think it's going to be probably around that $200 million Mark. And I think year-to-date so far, we are about 85. Next year, we haven\u2019t gone through all those details planning yet, but I would factor it to be probably through $200 million to $215 million range based on the project we've announced so far. Philip Gibbs : Okay. And with these investments or management of your order book right now, you planning on taking any downtime for routine or the plant maintenance in the third quarter and in the add newer facilities? Theresa Wagler : There is nothing like that, that's significant, right, that would rise the occasions to bring it forward, no. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi Investment Research. Please proceed with your question. Alex Hacking : The steel industry has been, I guess, very engaged with the Trump Administration regarding a trade. Are you engaged with them on other issues around U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, increasing steel demand by upgrading infrastructure and things like that? And I guess where is your confidence level that, we will see some kind of improved infrastructure spending on infrastructure bill have compared to where you're confidence level was six months ago? Thanks. Mark Millett : On our sort of personal involvement or company involvement, we\u2019re a lot -- we work with the, with our peers. We also work through the trade group of steel manufacturers association, on the steel trade issues in particular. On other issues, we tend just to work through or have the steel manufacturers, sort of work with us. Alex Hacking : Okay, thanks. And you mentioned\u2026 Mark Millett : Sorry. And on the infrastructure, I guess, Alex, I'm still positive and optimistic that somebody is going to come, coming back -- the country certainly needs it. There is no doubt about it. And as we said earlier, general construction continues to be positive. I think anecdotally, as I travel to New York and to Boston and to Washington and to big cities, the number of cranes in the air and the number of woodworks that screws up, travelling from A to B is just incredible. And I mean there is a lot of activity out there. The states have already, whatever it's called the fact act or infrastructure spending is kind of in place. In Indiana locally where we've seen a lot of announcements on road improvement and infrastructure improvement. So, even without the federal spend, states are coming in and increasing their construction activity. And I'm optimistic that the Trump Administration is just going to follow through on its promises. Alex Hacking : And then just a follow-up. In the press release, you talk about some hesitancy in customers in terms of order entry, hesitancy driven by volatility in scrap prices. Do you still see that hesitancy today as we're entering into the third quarter? Or are you seeing some behavioral change in the last few weeks? Thanks. Mark Millett : We are certainly not seeing the hesitancy today. That hesitancy I think we were kind of suggesting despite of the three weeks, four weeks period. And Barry, I can't remember if that was April or? Barry Schneider : I think in April, early May, we saw some hesitancy because of the uncertainties. That's been firmer lately, but not under the unreasonable rate as we addressed earlier with the 232 speculation. It's just healthy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Gagliano : These are primarily clarification questions from previous questions that were asked. First of all on the volume commentary, I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on the magnitude of the recovery expect. I think second quarter was down about 2.5% or something like that versus the first quarter. Should we expect that volume to be above the first quarter number, as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter, of the first quarter number? Mark Millett : I would hope we recover the quarter-over-quarter sort of production there. David Gagliano : It's helpful. And then just regarding metal spreads, obviously, I appreciate the commentary on the scrap market, given the mix changes, given what's happen within Steel Dynamics. Should we expect your metal spreads to improve in the third quarter versus the second quarter after adjusting for the lack of a $30 million hit? Theresa Wagler : Dave, you guys are making me a difficult spot here, Mark's laughing. And as we specifically just comment on the metal spread direction, specifically, I would say that I am going to quote back to what Mark said, the expectations for scrap for the rest of year remain pretty steady and we feel like the pricing increases are very much warranted. And we think that the market demand is there, absent any 232 to support that. So, you can read into that whatever you'd like, but I think the dynamics are positive. David Gagliano : Actually that's actually helpful, thank you. And then the last question is a longer term, but it ties into a lot of the questions that have been asked, generating still a lot of cash. Historically, preference has been you know buy over build versus return the cash. Obviously, a lot of moving parts here, you've got some capacity limitations on the flat roll, but still opportunities on long side internally. My question is given all those pieces, are you changing your view in terms of your preference of buy versus build? First, and secondly, where those cash return fit into the mix? Mark Millett : I think we have a strong desire to continue to build where is organic and we can have that sort of capital effectiveness or efficiency that I suggested earlier. Those kind of projects are just phenomenal from a payback and from a return perspective. A brand new greenfield mill is not necessary a focus of ours given the supply demand matrix domestically and globally. We feel and it's been amazing how many opportunities are out there in the M&A world that seem to come to and I wouldn\u2019t say come to market necessarily, probably. It's a not necessarily process out there, but we've been approached several times with interesting opportunities, none of which over the larger scale ones, check the all our boxes. I think you've seen in the past that we\u2019ve been disciplined or we're not going to be emotional. We recognize the cash generation capability of the Company and the cash build, understand that fully. But we see opportunities come before us and we will continue to assess those and one ticks the right boxes we will move forward. Theresa Wagler : From the capital allocation perspective just generally, we're really in the same spot and our first and foremost focus is to pull growth, both organic and inorganic. And then in the meanwhile, we increased the dividend in the first quarter and we'll continue to highly positive dividend profile as we see our cash flow structurally and continue to be sustainable at a much higher level. And then we use the lever of the buyback onto give additional value to shareholders, as appropriate as we generate free cash flow in front or behind the acquisitions, but not that you see us doing it basically, tend to continue to do. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Millett for any closing comments. Mark Millett : Thank you, Melisa, and thank you for spending the time with us today, those still on the call. Thank you to all our employees whether they are on the call or not, you done a phenomenal job continue to do phenomenal job. Customers; thank you for your support, and as I said earlier, we're working diligently and hard to create value for all of us and we're excited. We're excited as to how the Company is positioned for the next two, three, four, five years. So, thank you and have a good day and be safe. Operator : Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter call. We appreciate you all sharing time with us today. I'd like to thank the entire SDI team for maintaining a strong quarter-over-quarter performance and what was a challenging market environment and also express my sincere appreciation to our customers for their continued loyalty and support. Also I'd like to express our sympathy to those impacted by the hurricanes. Thankfully, our employees and their families remain safe during the storms, but our thoughts and prayers remain with those less fortunate. And before I pass it over to Theresa to comment on our third quarter financial results, I'd like the team to wish her Happy Birthday. Theresa, floor is yours. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Not sure, when did you know that. I also want to recognize the strong performance of the team really across the entire company all the platforms performed very well. Our third quarter 2017 net income was $153 million or $0.64 per diluted share including debt refinancing and repayment charges of $8 million pretax or $0.02 per diluted share. And for those of you that are wondering that $8 million is actually included in other expense on the income statement. Excluding these items are third quarter 2017 adjusted net income was $158 million or $0.66 within our adjusted guidance of between $0.63 and $0.67 per share. Third quarter 2017 revenues were on par with sequential second quarter sales at $2.4 billion with increased revenues across all three platforms. As average quarterly sales prices remain fairly steady and volumes marginally increased. Our third quarter operating income increased 2% sequentially to $271 million with improvement realized across all three platforms. But primarily result of higher engineered bar, structural and merchant steel shipments. Despite continued pressure from excess domestic production capacity and elevated imports for structural and merchant steel products. For the third quarter 2017, total steel shipments increased 2% sequentially to 2.5 million tons. Flat roll shipments were slightly lower, while long product steel volumes increased 6%. And for those of you, who are tracking our models of flat roll shipment. Hot roll coil and pickled and oil shipments were 863,000 tons in the quarter. Cold roll 136,000 tons and coated which included painted and galvanized 734,000 tons. Steel operating income increased $6 million or 2% to $280 million in the quarter, a result of higher long product shipment outpacing marginal metals spread compression. Our average quarterly external steel selling price decreased $1 per ton to $778 in the third quarter. Their average scrap cost increased $2 per ton to $305. For metals recycling platforms various metals spreads due to improved average quarterly scrap sales price and relatively heavy shipments resulting in third quarter 2017 operating income of $21 million. Additionally the team's done a great job optimizing cost throughout the business. With year-to-date 2017 operating income of $62 million more than doubled in last year's performance. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of vertically integrated model, benefiting both steel mills and the scrap operations. Metal recycling continues to support our steel mills sending 62% of their ferrous shipments internally. Our fabrication operations achieved record shipments for the third consecutive quarter, a continued indicator that the non-residential construction market is improving. Order backlog and order entry also remained robust. Third quarter 2017 operating income increased sequentially to $22 million, an 8% improvement related to higher shipments and some improvements now realized sales price. During the third quarter 2017, we generated cash flows from operations of $226 million year-to-date we've generated $548 million with operational working capital growing by $231 million, based on overall market improvement. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $128 million, we estimate full year 2017 capital expenditures to be about $190 million for the year. We maintained our cash dividend for the third quarter $0.155 per common share and we've repurchased $237 million of our common stock this year, with $99 million repurchased in the third quarter alone. We have $188 million that remained authorized. [Indiscernible] $450 million program, which we initiated October, 2016. We believe these actions have led the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and competence in our future. In September, we issued $350 million of new 4.125% senior notes due 2025 to repay our existing 6.375% senior notes due 2022. At September 30, 2017 we repaid $183 million of the existing senior notes, repaying the remaining amount of $167 million on October 13. As a result, our September balance sheet depicts excess cash and current debt of $167 million each. As mentioned, third quarter 2017 pretax earnings were reviewed by $8 million as a result of refinancing. Given the October final call date, fourth quarter 2017 pretax earnings will also be reduced by $6.6 million related to the refinancing charges. After giving it back to the October payment. Total debt of $2.4 billion remained consisted and liquidity remained strong at $2.1 billion with $935 million in adjusted cash and $1.2 billion of available revolver. These transactions extended our overall debt maturity profile and provided an estimated annual interest savings of $8 million. An incredible outcome, the team did a great job and we appreciate the continued support in the capital markets. Third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA with $347 million with trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA at a near record $1.4 billion. The strength of our recycled cash generated coupled with the strong credit and capital structure profile provides great opportunity for continued organic and transactional growth. We're squarely focused and on track for the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. As we turn in best in class financial results. The welfare of our employees remains our crucial focus of. Nothing surpasses the importance of creating, maintaining a safe work environment. Our safety performance continues to improve and remains significantly better than the industry averages. So far this year, we've further reduced our total recordable injury rate 19%, with 76% of our locations being incident-free. A sincere thanks go to the SDI family for an outstanding job, that challenge each and every one of us to remain focused and stride to our ultimate goal, zero-incident environment. Steel platform performed well in the quarter. Our production utilization was 92%, once again remarkably better than the estimated domestic industry rate of 75%. This is true in large part having one of the most diversified and value added product portfolios in the industry. In aggregate, we still have over 1 million tons of unused steel shipping capability, most of which is highly correlated to the construction sector. The management construction sector continues to improve, energy still has a long way to go, but we assume a continued positive demand trend. We're also seeing improved demand for heavy off road equipment and more general, industrial, manufacturing at Cats. Diversely [ph] the demand for the domestic automotive sectors turned down from a record - it still remains at historically strong levels. Fortunately, we continue to gain market share particularly at Columbus flat roll division, as they focus on automotives, direct sales and leverage our cost effective access to the Mexican market. The forecast continue to show increased demand. Slide to market dynamics, we continue to position our company for the future through the investment in our operations and to improve and manage our destiny. Within our flat roll operations we upgraded the hot roll galvanizing line and our Butler flat roll division, adding 180,000 tons of value added coding capability for a capital investment of only $15 million. The additional capacity came online this past May and is ramping up quickly. We also continue to ramp up the production of the new $100 million paint line at our Columbus flat roll division, which initiated prime shipments in the first quarter of this year. The new line provides 250,000 tons of annual coding capability and further diversification into some of our highest margin products. Complementing the two existing Indiana paint lines. This new line is state-of-the-art facility producing high quality HVAC appliance and double-wide steel. As geographic location facilitates economic access to the Southern US-Mexican markets. We anticipate the new paint line to be running close to full capacity by mid-year 2018. Columbus continues to be a significant earnings catalyst. The changes in the team has already made transformational and there are still more to come. The successful market and product diversification that was achieved over the last two years, is one of the key differentiators for our improved through cycle profitability and will continue to benefit the coming years as well. Despite an improving non-residential construction trend, non-product capacity utilization remained challenged, running on average between 70%, 75%. Much of the increased demand over the last 18 months has been absorbed by imports of standard beams and shapes along with considerable volume of prefabricated structural steel. Nonetheless our structural and merchant steel shipments increased in the quarter. And show increase due to through cycle utilizations, we're investing in our long product steel metals. We have three specific initiatives to increase the utilization and our structural metal division, which is been running on average between 70% to 75% capacity off late. First, we're growing production of [indiscernible] quality balloons to send to our engineered bar divisions. As it has excess rolling capacity. This should improve through cycle utilization at both facilities. Over the next 18 months ,we plan to increase this volume through an annualized rate in excess of 150,000 tons. This past quarter we transferred over 23,000 tons. Second, we further diversified our structured division's product offerings and recently began the production of large unequal leg angles and heavy clamps [ph]. We plan to enter the market in fall, the first of next year starting as much as 100,000 tons annually. Third, we recently announced $75 million expansion to utilize existing access melting and casting capability there. The project will further diversify our product portfolio and market sector exposure through the annual production of 240,000 tons of reinforcing bar. Coiled custom cut to length and smooth bar. Our intended business model should substantially enhance the current supply chain providing meaningful logistic yield and working capital benefits for the customer. In addition, we will be the large independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region. We expect begin operations by the end of 2018. Our Vulcan operation will provide a pull-through opportunity for this rebar project. As they currently consumed between 30,000 to 40,000 tons of smooth bar annually. In aggregate, these initiatives provide for approximately 500,000 tons or over 25% the potential traditional annual utilization of our structural and rail division over the next 24 months. We believe this will provide a material improvement in future through cycle utilization and obviously profitability. We're also investing $28 million to utilize excess melting and casting capability in our rolling and bar division. We are adding equipment that will allow for multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing of 200,000 tons per year. Similar to our Midwest investment, we expect to have strong market penetration as we will be the one of the largest independent producers of rebar in the Virginia area as well. We expect commissioning in the beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The profitability of our metals recycling platform remained aligned with strong performance demonstrated in the first half of 2017. For the third quarter, ferrous metal spread expansion related to higher prices and steady shipments. Additionally the team continues to optimize administrative and operating costs. [Indiscernible] operating income more than doubled compared to last year. We anticipate good scrap flows that continue throughout the fall and winter months, as the areas devastated by the hurricanes began to remove debris and rebuild. We anticipate this added supply that began impacting our chain in the coming months, further stabilizing scrap price environment. The fabrication platform also continued a strong performance achieving at third consecutive quarter record shipments. Order backlog remains strong. The team continues to achieve great market penetration of both choice [ph] and deck. Our fabrication operations purchased 330,000 tons of steel from SDI steel mills in 2016 and are on track to continue to purchase similar quantities in 2017. The power of pull-through volume fabrication sources steel from our own mills is a significant advantage to keeping our steel platform utilization rates higher during weaker demand environments. The New Millennium team continues to perform exceptionally well levering our national footprint and providing quality product. The ongoing strength of its business and continued customer optimism also drives positive insight into a continued strength of non-residential construction activity. On a macro market basis, we continue to have a positive view on domestic steel consumption. Domestic automotive production maybe coming off record levels, but we believe total mass production will continue to grow, as Mexico continues to expand production with current assets in place. This is highly complementary to our Columbus division's automotive strategy. Additionally, we believe that we continue to grow in construction and the energy sectors. This will be a solid foundation for a strong pricing environment as the macro market drivers continue to be persuasive. General global economies are showing some positive momentum. Strong internal China demand is reduced absolute level of exports and driven strong price appreciation. And additionally winner curtailments will add to upward pricing pressure. European pricing exceeds domestic pricing on a dilutive basis. So the arbitrage of domestic to global pricing has essentially evaporated with no incentive to apply foreign material. Imports will continue to decline through the fourth quarter and demand trend is positive and inventories are on the low side and mill lead times are pretty healthy. These dynamics could create a tight market and lead to significant price appreciation as we saw at the end of last year. In fact this could already be happening as recent order input rates have increased considerably as reflected by the recent price increases. On business model, execution in the long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation. Demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification, with low cost operating platforms supports our ability to maintain our best in class financial performance and differentiation. The company and the team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth. The strong character and the determination of our employees provides the foundation for our success. And I think each of them for their hard work and dedication. And remind them, safety is always our first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, for our customers, for our employees and shareholders alike. And look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us, in the years ahead. So again, thank you for your time today. And Doug, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : I'll start with one question on the flat roll division, please. Can you give us the better sense of the anticipated impact on flat roll volumes in the fourth quarter for anticipated outages that you've provided in the call this morning? Theresa Wagler : Seth, the $25 million collectively does include excess expense, but it also includes the impact of those reduced volumes. We specifically didn't foresee the amount of specific volume reduction in the release itself, but it does include both of those items and a significant part of that, really is the reduced volume versus the extra expense. Seth Rosenfeld : Thank you. Can you just give us some sense of the tonnage that might be impacted and one, I have a follow-up question to that as well. You've flagged earlier the impact of elevated port inventory overhang on price in the last quarter. Can you give us since what the situation is like today, please? Mark Millett : I think Seth the impact from both Columbus and Butler is going to be in the vicinity of. Unidentified Company Representative : About 100,000 tons between the two facilities. Theresa Wagler : And about any extra volume that was exported. Mark Millett : Well I don't think there is any way true to getting sort of compensated volume. I do believe obviously people or traders themselves ahead Section 232, we do believe that volume is or has been joined over the last several months. We believe that the market will tell you that in conjunction with the decline in order input, will tighten the market by the end of the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Alex Hacking : Mark, you just mentioned that you've seen order input rates ticking up recently. Maybe could you give a little more color there? If that in - is that more in flat products or long products or I guess how recently have you seen that tick up and what kind of magnitude is it? Thank you. Mark Millett : On the long product side, things are relatively flat, order input rate wise. The increase is been definitely on the flat roll sheet side of our business. It's probably just this last week, that we've seen that, it's considerable and it's parallel the market that we saw last year. If you look back last year, I think it was September in that case. There was a low hesitation - customers sort of order input rate, it was very short lived four weeks and all of a sudden things normalized and I think, we're seeing that same market environment today. People anticipated. I think that the certain mark was going to come up area in October, held back their orders accordingly. And now people getting back in the market. I think our customers are recognizing that the market is bottomed and we're seeing, as I said a very positive order profile. Alex Hacking : Thanks, that's very clear. And if I could just follow-up with one more. Let me ask about something. I'm sure you've been asked about it lot recently. Maybe comment on graphite electrode prices your contract, situation inventory and maybe just an overview of the situation there. Thanks. Mark Millett : Well essentially, it hasn't impacted us in 2017 and we haven't - it's clear through the first quarter going in the second quarter of next year at 2017 prices. I think, there's a little bit of panic in that market price, I think people need to recognize the commodity markets, have a natural ability to balance themselves to reach kind of an equilibrium. The recent abnormal market skyrocketing spot prices I think is abated a little and we expect more normalized pricing environment prevailed in 2018. I think people are always seeing an expanded needle coke supply availability today. Given our longstanding relationships and some of us have been working with these folks 25, 30 years now. We will be considered a core customer, which ensures a committed supply throughout 2018, so supply for us I don't think is an issue whatsoever. I think, one can expect the tighter market and increased raw material input cost for the electrode producer will support somewhat higher pricing. Although I'm confident that they recognize, they can put the electric arc furnace producer at a cost disadvantage to the integrated competition, as they would lose market share, so prudence will prevail. Our expectation is for pricing to be at a more normalized level of two - in a range of two to three times, 2017 pricing. And I think, as you probably know it's not a significant impact to SDI, as electrodes are currently less than about half of percent of our cost [ph]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli from Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Novid Rassouli : On the engineered bar side, the level of shipments I don't think we've ever seen these in years maybe this is even potentially a record. I was just wondering if you can discuss how you're seeing the end markets shaping up and maybe just a give a little bit more color on the strength that we've seen this year. Mark Millett : Honestly we added the 300,000, 350,000 tons of capacity back in, when was that. About 18 months ago and two years and that is been ramping up so that's given us - provided a new capability. We still have quite a long way to go, to fill out that utilization which is a good news. I think in almost in every market we've seen more strength, we've been taking up automotive that's not necessarily - because the automotive strength but the expansion that we made and if you remembered on the lower diameter, smaller diameter size range which is principally the automotive range, so we've been penetrating picking up market share. Teams have done a very, very good job there. Off-road equipment, heavy machinery is been up, the Caterpillars of the world, the John Deere's ensuring positive momentum so that's been good. And we've also been beneficiary of the recovering energy markets. We put material into seems two markets and also into forging, for valves and those sorts of things. Generally pretty good there, industrial and manufacturing is also picking up a little bit. The only area of weakness and it's in \u2013weak for more than two years now and that's agriculture. Theresa Wagler : Novid just a bit reminder that 325,000 ton expansion in the smaller diameter really made for the engineered bar, both had extra rolling capacity versus melting capacity and that's the reason for one of the initiatives we'll be sending blue from a structural norm down to engineered bar so we can fully utilize that 950,000 tons of rolling capacity. Novid Rassouli : Got it, great. And then the second question is just given the strength that we've seen I guess on your long products relatively to the flat products recently, do you guys see kind of path to utilizing this million tons of latent capacity, I know we've talked about in the past and it seems like a great opportunity for you to unlock potential leverage and the model and so just wanted to see, if you guys had any thoughts about kind of, if the past to utilizing that is becoming more clear now versus six to 12 months ago. Thanks. Mark Millett : I think the non-residential construction markets will continue to incrementally increase and as such we will increase with that. It's a very competitive market arena. Obviously if there was an infrastructural build and it will be momentous for us to utilize that as additional capacity. But we always have focused ourselves on what we can do to control our own destiny, we don't manage to hope, we don't hope that markets are going to come back, we don't hope that we're going to have to trade cases to protect ourselves. Hence the diversification projects that we've got in place. Given another 12 months, if the structural and rail division will have a total different complexion and I believe not unlike the transformation that we've had at Columbus but we'll see the same at Columbia City. Theresa Wagler : And in addition to that, we have the 500,000 tons that we're focusing which is kind of half of that volume structural and rail division. But you also have the additional 200,000 tons related to rebar at rolling and bar division, there is a lot of things internally that will start to hopefully unlock in the next 12 to 24 months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : Mark, it's interesting you were talking some improvement last week, but I guess I wanted to ask you why we've seen the slippage in the spot price because in hot roll, right as you say your imports have been slipping and they haven't been competitive, we've heard that for the last month or so and yet we've seen the spot price slipped, we just hear that the mills are calling around looking for business, is that typical seasonality or is there something more to be concerned about there is that just with scrap prices. Can you tell us why maybe we can [indiscernible] a bit? Mark Millett : Well Timna I think we are actually a little confused by it as many of our customers are. And again it parallels last year. and if you can answer why we saw four weeks of the industry, not just SDI but the industry saw a four week low, back then I think it's the same this year. My only explanation will be again anticipation of lower spot pricing in October just like take the foot off the pedal. You see underlying demand. Underlying demand just doesn't change overnight. I believe underlying demand into October last year, continue to on this path and that demand is in place today, this year as well. Timna Tanners : Okay, so some seasonality you're saying is a contributing bidding factor. Mark Millett : Seasonality to me is seasons, which is two to three months or a quarter. This literally is four weeks. Timna Tanners : Okay, fair enough. And then my other question was really about you and several of the other mills have been talking about targeting the Mexican market with new galv lines and so on, it's been quite a lot of activity in Mexico or near the Mexican border. I just want to ask, I'm getting this questions from clients but are you hearing any - are you getting any concern over the NAFTA rework and what that might mean for your business in the region going forward? Mark Millett : I don't see any renegotiation in NAFTA impacting our business. The US, the Mexican are both incredibly dependent on each other. There's a massive expansion of demand, of industrial activity in Mexico that the US is dependent on. So I don't see any inhibition of flow between the two country. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : I just had a question on the merchant bar in B markets. Obviously pretty substantial price cuts at least in terms of the list pricing. I know part of that was for pricing transparency, but wondering if we should think about any modest realized pricing pressure for you in Q4 or are you anticipating those prices are going to be reasonably stable versus where they were because pretty draconian kind of cut from our perspective. Mark Millett : I would agree that was draconian, but the impact will be somewhat flattish there could be some off the smaller consumers that see that drop, but there will be kind of an averaging out of just the pricing meeting whether the actual pricing is playing out. Phil Gibbs : I appreciate that Mark and follow-up from me is on the side of rail. I know that's tucked in the structural division right now and we don't have as much visibility on it, but just curious in terms of what you're seeing in that market in terms of demand and pricing dynamics. Thanks very much. Glenn Pushis : Phil, this is Glenn Pushis. I would tell you that we're seeing it to be solid still through the year, but flat through the four quarter. We anticipate next year to still see the standard stability that we've seen in the last two years. Obviously rail has it's challenges right now to rail roads on endeavour [ph] challenges, so they look to have basically a flat line through 2018 as what they're telling us. Theresa Wagler : So Phil from, actually an interesting point if you look at the structural and rail division shipment. You would have seen the typical there is seasonality within rail. So the third quarter is always the weakest quarter in rail volume that the rail roads determine what they're going to be needing for the coming year. And so that additional bump in volume is really on the construction side, it's on the [indiscernible] which again points to the strength of the construction market itself. So we would expect both rail and shipment back to improve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Jorge Beristain : I just wanted to ask, what your view was on the recent price from a competitor again to beat a dead horse, but do you think that we're just exiting this kind of one month air pocket and there is rationale in the market to take pricing higher? Mark Millett : Again not to be redundant, but the maximum environment at least would suggest to me that the pricing should already be higher than where we're today. We've seen this low, the aftermarket pricing came up some and softened. It didn't come to the same sort of debt to softening that we saw last year that came up, not as much. And everything seems to be in place for a stronger market again. China is reversed they've got sort of a better internal demand. They're absolute export levels of triple down and not just tripled down or probably I don't know half what they were last year, year-over-year and their pricing is, Asian pricing in general is appreciated. View that's kind of come out of the debt of steel recession where they're seeing some positive movement, their pricing on a dilutive basis to the US is at par not more expensive than domestic pricing. And so the arbitrage really is just as I said earlier is just evaporated and if you look at the historic range of spread between domestic pricing and global pricing we should be much higher than where we are today. Given the demand trend is positive, so the centers have come up a little, they're not at that historic low that they were two or three months ago, but they're still at a reasonably low level. And imports should be moderating, continue moderate and decline through the fourth quarter. So I just see it setting up a very, very positive pricing environment for the first quarter of 2018 and all the way through 2018. Jorge Beristain : Right, so the global set up is great. But what about domestic recent scrap weakness being down $30, $40 a month. Do you think that there is a little bit of pause in the market as clients might be waiting to get some of that benefit of the lower raw material cost passed onto them? Mark Millett : I think they have waited, but they are now returning to the market place. Russ, do you want to give some color on scrap? Russ Rinn : Yes. I think certainly we saw a production in October, but our outlook is, we did fourth quarter here, it's going to get marginally stronger on the scrap side. It will take a little bit of time with the outages that are out in the fourth quarter from the steel mills, we'll see a trend upward verse the fourth quarter. Certainly will add all steel mills. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Seelaus Capital. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy : I've noticed one of your potential suppliers is putting up $700 million towards plant in Toledo which resides on the Indiana border and spending another bit of money to expand production capacity in Canada. As you guys look as SBQ and flat roll and that sort of thing, sort of forward towards the future. You see yourselves picking up market share in little end products a little flat roll, SBQ relative to integrated in the next five to 10 years. Mark Millett : Well I think we've shown that we've been picking up market share already and that will certainly continue, but obviously getting to sort of capped out position relative to volume, it's that three one-ish today and I think still tweak a little, but it's - those guys have been tweaking for 20 years. Amazingly tweaking for 20 years and I think we're sort of capacity there. The Columbus sort of 3.4 million ton production capability today. So that mill really hasn't sort of pressed, we spent the last two years since we pushed the reconfiguring the product portfolio diversifying the market exposure and team's done a phenomenal job there. They've done a phenomenal job developing new products and part of the shutdown here in fourth quarter is to change it according capability so that we can coil thicker, wider, higher strength materials so it's going to be expanding a product mix. So that mill will go into sort of optimization of productivity, so I think this is certainly volume growth there. We will continue to penetrate and increase market share. Theresa Wagler : And Brett, we can't forget the tax as well, there is another probably 250,000 tons of capacity available at Texas [ph] so there is still room in the flat roll. Brett Levy : All right, so I mean sort of kind of point down at [indiscernible] degassing and various things added perhaps in the future what's with, they have 10 years from [indiscernible] dynamics [indiscernible] before. Mark Millett : Well we have degassing capability at the Columbus facility again we continue - industry continues to work its way up the quality curves so to speak, but we are able to supply pretty much anything on the car, today with the exception of the exposed skin. The exposed skin volume actually is kind of deteriorated over the last five to six, 10 years as plastics and other things have become dominant there. And so the exposed volume total is not a massive part of the automotive segment and so we're really not missing add on much. Most of the car to be supplied by Butler and SDI phase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with our question. Curt Woodworth : Two questions. Just one on the electrode dynamic, you talked about sort of normal market pricing roughly 2X to 3X above, this year. But we're clearly not in a normal market. So do you think that the contract price for next year would settle something meaningfully above that and have you guys thought about implementing electrode surcharge, to I think some of your competitors out? Mark Millett : We got someone [technical difficulty] but I think, when I say 2X to 3X. I believe that's probably the pricing range for 2018. But again there's going to be a bifurcation I do believe between cold customers and sort of new entrants and probably folks in Europe and Turkey they might see a very, very different price. But I think two or three times could be an expectation for next year. Curt Woodworth : Okay and then with regards to capital deployment running pretty low leverage in balance sheet generating a lot of cash, do you see the potential for something more transformative in terms of the acquisition opportunity for you guys this year and what would be your comfort level in terms of I guess in the short run how much leverage you're willing put on the balance sheet? Mark Millett : You never know when opportunities arise, so timing wise I would say we - it will happen when it happens. I think, it should discipline in the past, we're not emotional and going and spend the cash because we got it on the balance sheet. So we are going to be prude. I would tell you that the last 18 months the pipeline has been relatively full of opportunities and the pipeline remains full and we keep assessing different projects in three principal areas, one obviously steel, we can't forget that we are steel producers and teams have done a pretty damn good job at that. They also do a phenomenal job at things processing sort of value add opportunities and then thirdly, there is a focus on manufacturing where we could increase our pull-through volume from our mills. Theresa Wagler : Curt regarding the leverage, we just add to that our there are preference for recycle, not leverage less than three times so obviously the capacity on the balance sheet with EBITDA $1.4 billion is significant enough for us to be able to do something transformative and yet, still be very strong I think from a credit profile. And in addition to that, as we are looking at all these M&A opportunities which are several, we also are still redeploying our resources through both positive dividend profile which we kept over the last numerous years as well as levering the repurchase program which you saw we utilized that more aggressively in the third quarter and then we were thinking that, that could be something that we do on a go forward basis as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Sean Wondrack : My question is more about the infrastructure market. Obviously the US dollar was very strong making it attractive for Turkey to export over here on the long product side. Obviously with the weakening of the US dollar become less attractive to them. Have you seen pricing began to expand in the infrastructure market and do you think that there is plausibly some demand some additional demand coming from the rebuilds and even on the auto side with all the cars that were lost in the storms. Thank you. Mark Millett : But I believe certainly on the auto front. If the slide was up, different people report different numbers, but anywhere from 500,000 to 800,000 cars are lost. Those folks will come back to market. Obviously there's a certain timing for insurance sort of reconciliation on all that process for them to come back. So I would say, on the automotive side we're - asked to unfortunately we'll bring a little bit of bright light there and the rebuild we'll have an incremental impact on just construction volume themselves. I think we're forecasting just incremental growth in the products for 2018, no hockey stick. Unless there were to be an infrastructure build and then it would be quite considerable. Theresa Wagler : Aside from the things that we're doing internally with the initiatives that we mentioned in structural and rail division. Mark Millett : Yes, that's just meaning that the market plays itself. Sean Wondrack : Right and have you begin to see pricing move up in those markets at all? Mark Millett : That thing is still relatively flat there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : A few more follow-up questions please. When it comes to the beam market given the continued import pressure that you've seen and the recent price cuts that had to be taken. I was wondering if you can comment on why there is been no trade action here to-date. Is an area that you might be doing some work on, we could expect some progress into 2018 or is there a reason why there is going to be less progress in this direction for being what we've seen on the flat side to-date. Mark Millett : Within the beam market, it tends to be much more complicated process to prove injury. It's a very diverse fragmented industry about hundreds and hundreds of different fabricators out there. And so just the process that bring a trade case is difficult, there is work being done on that. That's where in almost the sort of Section 232 could probably bring most benefits, certainly the most benefit to SDI because I do believe that the prefabricated structural and what I call straight - imports are going to be included, we believe. Seth Rosenfeld : It's great, thank you. And one more please. I remember last quarter you had some challenges in the ramp up of Butler galv line and also the paint line in Columbus. Can you just confirm what are the status of these two projects and perhaps expected ramp up schedule into 2018? Mark Millett : On the galv line and Butler it was anticipated start up progress, it's actually moving along very well still, we expanded the capabilities of alliance. So as we get more experience, we will allow the sales force to go out and take advantage of that and that's proceeded exactly as we had hoped. The paint line in Columbus is also doing very well. There is a lot of trials and approval processes that are involved as we enter into new markets in the Southern US and those trials are doing very well today as well, these are very complicated products. So we've been having our customers in shops helping us and it's really been great opportunity for the team and all of our paint line folks have been circling back and forth between the various lines we have, so it's a great time and we think we are on a good progress to earn some awards for next year. So more and more of these are approved, we see the ramp up picking up. So we kind of to the side, space for these as we get products approved and then we grow into them. So we don't want to let people down, but we're also pushing the team pretty hard. Theresa Wagler : Thing about timing perspective the paint line in Columbus we believe will be at basically full run rate by mid-2018 and I would expect that market depending you can utilize as much of that additional 180,000 tons of galvanized line capacity in Butler next year as well. Mark Millett : That's the plan. And the specific start up issue we had on the galv line painted product in the second quarter is absolutely totally behind us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Bradford : Recently the Chinese have really ballooned their exports of steel scrap, over 400,000 tons in August less than 900,000 for the eight months. Are you seeing any of that material coming here? And in the past, there's been quality issues by grade and what have you with Chinese scrap? Can you talk about that a bit? Mark Millett : Well I don't think we've been a major consumer of Chinese scrap. We certainly have been a consumer of import of scrap from other countries at our Columbus, Mississippi market. Russ? Russ Rinn : We aren't getting any Chinese scrap at least in our regions, we may have seen some on the West Coast, but if any I think most of that stuff is going on Southeast Asia. Charles Bradford : What about the quality? I guess if you haven't seen any, you wouldn't know how good they're doing as far as dividing up the different grades and what have you? Mark Millett : Chuck we haven't seen it to say one way or the other. Charles Bradford : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well thank you, Doug. And again once again thank you for your time today and thank you employees for doing a phenomenal job in the quarter. Again quarter-over-quarter the performance relative to all our peers was I think significant, shows the differentiation in our company. We are dependent on our loyal customer base, so thank you customers that may be listening and to the shareholders. Again thank you for your support, we endeavour each and every day to make sure that we have a better shareholder appreciation than anyone else on the planet in the steel sector, so. Thank you. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning and happy 2018. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call. We appreciate you sharing your time with us this morning. I'd like to thank the entire SDI team for the dedication and exceptional performance last year. Along with the support of our customers, vendors and shareholders, we collectively achieved best-in-class results. Most importantly, we did safely; safely than ever before. On many measures 2017 was a record year both operationally and financially; record steel and fabrication shipments, record operating income of $1.1 billion, record EBITDA at $1.4 billion, and the momentum continues. The underlying positive market fundamentals coupled with our own growth initiatives, I was really excited for the coming year. With the beginning this morning, I'll ask Theresa to comment on our results. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone and I want to share my [ph], congratulations to the entire SDI family. It really was a tremendous year on many fronts and numerous milestones as Mark mentioned were achieved. Record sales of $9.5 billion with increased price gain over all our platforms and record steel and fabrication volume, record pretax earnings of $935 million and EBITDA of $1.4 billion. And as Mark said, most importantly, we accomplished all of this with record safety performance. To recognize into our appreciation for the tremendous performance of the team in December we paid well-deserved $1,000 cash performance over to each non-executive eligible employee totaling just over $7 million. Full year 2017 net income was $813 million or $3.36 per diluted share which included the following items. Third and fourth quarter debt refinancing charges totaling $15 million and a onetime tax benefit of $181 million resulting from the revaluation of our deferred tax assets liabilities in connection with the recently enacted U.S. federal tax cuts [ph]. Our current estimate for our 2018 effective tax rate, federal and state combined, was between 24% and 25% which is meaningfully free from our recent history where we were close to 35%. Excluding these items we still achieved record annual net income of $641 million or $2.55 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter our net income of $305 million or $1.28 per diluted share. Excluding the onetime tax benefit of $0.76 that was unknown and specifically excluded at the time of our guidance and the fourth quarter refinancing cost of $0.02 per diluted share our fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income was $0.54 per diluted share. Consolidated fourth quarter 2017 revenues were $2.3 million, 4% lower than the sequential quarter while operating income was $196 million representing a 28% sequential decline; both declines were result of lower shipments and metal spread in our field operations. Specifically for the fourth quarter field shipments decreased 4% sequentially across both in flat roll and rolling bar divisions to 2.4 million tons. Steel metal spread also compressed as our average quarterly sales price declined $17 per ton in the fourth quarter and our average scrap costs consumed only $305. Off note though, of the $17 decline in average pricing, $9 per ton was actually associated with mixed shift and most of that was in the flat roll. Our Columbus and Butler flat roll divisions also successfully completed planned improvement averages which resulted in less shipments and increased cost in October reducing fourth quarter earnings by approximately $27 million. As a result, the fourth quarter operating income of $207 million from our steel operations, about 26% less than prior to our third quarter. For the full year our steel operations achieved numerous performance milestones resulting in record volume of 9.7 million tons and operating income of $1.1 billion. Annual metal spread also improved as average sales price increased more than our average scrap costs. For our metals recycling platform; ferrous metal spread stayed steady in the fourth quarter to slight lower average quarterly scrap price; conversely non-ferrous shipments and metal spreads improved resulting in fourth quarter 2017 operating income of $22 million. The teams did a great job optimizing cost throughout the business, they achieved full year operating income of $85 million, this is more than double last year's recycling performance. We are effectively levering the strength of our vertically integrated model which benefits both the steel mills and the scrap operations. The mills recycling group shipped 53% of their fair scrap to our own steel mill increasing scrap quality, efficiency and reducing working capital. In fabrication our 2017 operating income was $22 million, for the full year the team achieved getting another year record shipments and order backlog remains very healthy. 2017 fabrication operating income was also strong annually but it declined slightly to $88 million based on higher priced steel input. We generated strong cash flow from operations in 2017 at $740 million and free cash flow after success of investment of $575 million. Operational working capital also grew at $251 million during the year based on the overall market improvement resulting in higher customer accounts and inventory value. Full year capital investments totaled $165 million. We maintained our fourth quarter cash dividend at $0.155 per common share after increasing at 11% in the first quarter of 2017. We repurchased $252 million of our common stock in the year and have $173 million still available pursuing to the $450 million board authorized program which was initiated in October 2016. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence of our future. Based on our strong cash flow generation we maintain liquidity at $2.2 billion with $1 billion in cash and $1.2 billion of available funding our revolving credit facility. The strength of our through cycle cash generation coupled with strong credit and capital structure profile provides great opportunity for continued organic and transactional growth. We're squarely focused at one-track for the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Thank you, Mark. Mark Millett : Super, Theresa. For concerning safety, the team did a phenomenal job last year achieving the seventh consecutive year of improved safety performance. Each of the platforms sent me records; we reduced our total recordable injury rate by a further 18% while two-thirds of our locations were incident free. Clearly, the safety conversations [ph], actions and programs that had taken place throughout the company are having an impact. The safety and welfare of our employees will remain our number one priority for all time. My sincere thanks go to the entire SDI family for an outstanding job but as always, I challenge each of us to remain focused and to strive toward our ultimate goal, a zero incident environment everywhere we work. As Theresa outlined, the steel platform continue to perform at the top of the industry in 2017. Our production utilization rate was 92% for the full year and 89% from the fourth quarter; once again, markedly better than the domestic industry rate of approximately 74%. This is due in large part to our having one of the most diversified and value added product portfolios in the industry. With over 11 million tons of annual shipping capability, we still have well over 1 million tons of latent availability as the markets continue to strengthen. Demand from the construction and energy sectors continues to improve. We're also seeing better demand for our heavy and off-road equipment and more general industrial manufacturing accounts. Demand from the automotive sector is still strong, although lot has peaked from a historical perspective it is expected to be incrementally higher than last year. Fortunately, we continue to gain market share, especially at the Columbus flat roll division with our focus on automotive direct sales. We also benefit there from a cost effective access into Mexico where forecasts continue to show increasing automotive great steel demand. Domestic steel consumption improved by 5% or 6% for the year and we believe it will grow further in 2018. But steel imports also rose in '17 by over 15% representing over 30% of domestic consumption; this just really hasn't changed. We're considered one of the lowest cost steel producers in the industry. We are ready to compete and we want to compete but we must have a level playing field, we can't compete with unfair trade practices such as those occurring today. While I'm pleased with the recent decline in out roll imports related to the successful past trade cases and the DOC affirmative decision on Chinese circumvention through Vietnam, the tremendous that Chinese subsidized over capacity remains a problem. In particular, there are still massive imports of structural and fabricated structures [ph] coming in from China and historically high imports of coded flat roll along with [indiscernible] from Asian countries using Chinese steel. I believe that after an affirmative National Security finding under 232 by the DOC the President will be provided possible ways to reset the game to enforce the rules. President Trump needs to provide a meaningful remedy that helps maintain and revitalize the U.S. steel industry while the Chinese overcapacity issue is being addressed. But as usual, we remained focused on things we can control. For example; we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future through new investment in our existing operations. A few that occurred during 2017 include the $16 million investment to the added galvanizing capacity at our steel of West Virginia plant. This value-added service is ramping up well beyond expectations and is expected to provide less than a two-year payback. $15 million investment that upgraded our Butler flat roll divisions galvanizing line also adding an additional 180,000 tons of value added coding capacity; this project will have less than a one-year payback. Our $100 million investment and a new paint line at the Columbus flat roll division began operating in the first quarter of 2017. The new line provides 250,000 tons of annual coding capability and further diversification into some of our highest margin products. Complementing the two existing paint lines in Indiana, this new line is a state-of-the-art facility producing high quality HVAC appliance products and double-wide steel. As geographic location also facilitates economic access to the Southern U.S. and Mexican markets; it is on-track to be running close to full capacity by mid-year 2018 this year. Columbus continues to be a significant earnings catalyst. The changes the team has already made are transformational and there are still more to come including production gains, value added product mix shifts and additional costs savings. The successful market and product diversification achieved over the last three years is one of the key differentiators for our improved through cycle profitability and will continue to benefit the coming years as well. Despite an improving non-residential construction trend, non-product capacity utilization remained challenged at 75%. Much of the increased demand over the last three years has been absorbed by imports of standard beams and shapes along with a considerable volume of prefabricated structural steel. Improved fabricated steel imports have increased over 80% in the last five years alone; nonetheless, the team did a good job and our long product shipments improved 9% year-over-year. But to ensure higher future through cycle utilizations, we're investing in our long product steel mills. We have three specific initiatives to increase the utilization of our structural rail division which has been running at an average of 75%. First, we're growing the production of SBQ quality blooms [ph] to send to our engineered bar divisions as that division now has excess rolling capacity. This should improve through cycle utilization at both facilities. Over the next 18 months, we plan to increase this volume to an annualized rate of close to or above 150,000 tons. And we're well on our way that with 29,000 tons transferred just this past quarter. Second, we further diversified the mills product offerings and recently began the production of large unequal leg angles and heavy clamps which is entering the market and we plan to sell as much as 100,000 tons annually. Third, we're investing $75 million to utilize existing access melting and casting capability there. This expansion will further diversify our product portfolio and market sector exposure through the annual production of 240,000 tons of reinforcing bar including spooled, custom, cut-to-length and bar. Our intended business model should substantially enhance the current supply chain providing meaningful logistic yield and working capital benefits for the customer. In addition, we will be the large independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region, and we plan to begin operations of that facility by the end of 2018. In aggregate, these initiatives provide for over 500,000 tons or over 25% of potential additional annual utilization of our structural and rail division over the next 18 months. We believe this can provide a material improvement in future through cycle utilization and profitability. We're also investing $28 million to utilize excess melting and casting capability at our rolling and bar division. We are adding equipment that will allow for multi-strand slitting and rebar finishing of 200,000 tons per year. Similar to our Midwest investment, we expect to have strong market penetration as we will be the one of the largest independent producers of reinforcing bar in the Virginia area as well. Equivalent commissioning which has started and the team plans to begin selling the product at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Our metals recycling platform recorded a tremendous performance in 2017. Despite selling a few non-core locations during the year the team is able to maintain volume while increasing metal spread and reducing cost throughout the year; the result and the earnings more than doubled. Trans scrap flow has been steady and we expect it to stay that way. The weather did slow the flow of obsolete scrap in December and a gain in January; this coupled with an uptick and export activity has timed the market a little low but we expect flows to pick up and the pricing environment to stabilize as the year progresses. Fabrication platform also delivered an incredibly strong performance with another year of record shipments and strong earnings. Our order backlog remains strong; the ongoing strength for this business and continued customer optimism is a solid indicator that the non-residential construction market is continuing to grow. As an added benefit, our fabrication platform purchased over 330,000 tons of steel from SDI steel mills in 2017. The power of this pull-through volume and we saw steel internally from our own mills is a significant catalyst for higher steel utilization rates. This pull-through strategy remains one of our focuses for ongoing growth. We remain confident that the markets conditions are in place to benefit steel consumption in 2018. Domestic steel inventory levels have moderated, world steel demand and pricing has structurally improved. Domestic steel demand remains healthy and we believe consumption will grow in 2018. Our business model and the execution of our long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer focus coupled with market diversification and low cost operating platforms supports our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance and differentiation. The Company and the team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth. Our phenomenal team provides the foundation for our success and I thank each and every one of them for their hard work and commitment and remind them safety is always our first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our Company, customers, employees and shareholders alike, and look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us in the years ahead. So again, thank you for your time today and Brenda, we'll take questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Seelaus Capital. Please go ahead with your question. Brett Levy : Can you just give a little bit of an update on the Section 232 Case? Mark Millett : Well, I think anything we give might be a speculation. I think we're probably as close as anyone to it but I wouldn't put money on the table other than I think it's going to be positive. Just generally in trade, we're very happy and as we anticipate in our last call, the anti-circumvention ruling against Vietnam was very, very positive and I think that's going to end up flowing into other countries as well and Vietnam itself imported about 450,000 tons of coated product in last year. So that's generally positive, more specifically, the past trade cases have eroded in volumes in certain areas such as [indiscernible]. But volumes in general remain incredibly high as the Chinese subsidized overcapacity just remains in place and I think it's in several areas that is a problem that is honestly in cover sheet and galvanized on a flat roll side, those are at record import levels last year. And also in structural, we're still seeing about 1 million tons of straight beams coming in along with about 1.2 million tons of fabricated or pre-fabricated structures; so you have about 2.2 million tons of structural imports against 5 million or 6 million ton market, so that is a major issue along with [indiscernible] imports from Korea. And that's where I think Section 232 can have the greatest impact, I do believe there will be a positive remedy; if you just look at yesterday's announcement about washing machines and solar panels, I think it just gives you insight as per the climate and the thinking of the administration and I'm very, very confident that the administration will give a positive room for us. Brett Levy : And you addressed most of this but I mean I'm just going to ask for a little more granularity; if you look across your product mix, what are the products that are most likely to be as your best guess against the type of investigation and commentary that you've heard from the government on 232? What are the product areas that most likely to benefit? And what are the products areas that are least likely to benefit? Mark Millett : I think I've already enumerated the three principal areas Brett; coded I think will be a big benefit for us particularly in let's just say -- building products, it can come around at a higher rate. Type 2 [ph], although we don't produce it directly obviously the energy market is a huge -- the largest consumer, at least historically of hot roll coil, and if that tightens up, hot roll coil which is already tight today is going to be a very desired commodity. And I think just a structural -- the pre-fabricated structure would be huge for us along with which is a straight structure. When you have 2.2 million tons of that product coming in, and literally it's 5 million ton market, I think that would have tremendous impact because obviously structural products much in mill and also Columbus City is running at low utilization -- relatively low utilization as compared to [indiscernible]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Curt Woodworth : So first question is on capital allocation; it's from the balance sheet and clearly free cash flow capability they share with lower tax rate would suggest that in addition to acquisitions, you have pretty substantial wherewithal to return cash back to the shareholder either through central dividend or increasing and enhancing the share buyback. And so outside of the acquisition opportunities, can you comment on the potential return capital back to shareholders this year? Mark Millett : I think our general strategy is going to be no different this year than the past years. Our absolute focus and priority is organic growth because there we have the most effective capital sort of efficiency and return on our money. Secondly, transactional growth, we continue to see opportunities, we've been disciplined and careful but we see good opportunity there for great returns. And secondly or thirdly, we continue our sort of positive dividend profile; we'll remain conservative there, we recognize as we send them past dividends or private [ph], it's an absolute number, we don't necessarily yield the absolute number which is today but on $45 million but I would expect to see a continued positive profile there as our through cycle cash generation profile continues to improve. And we will continue to complete the shareholder -- the share repurchase plan we have. Curt Woodworth : Okay. And then with respect to the acquisition opportunities, can you comment on preference for either growing upstream or downstream and then there has been obviously more development of HBI capability in the U.S. and discussion of more merchant pig iron development; are those -- would be coming backward integrated than raw materials be something that you would entertain or look to partner into? Mark Millett : We've had a lot of experience in that field and I would suggest we don't see a good use of our cash in the HBI arena or in the merchant pig iron facilities at least as we see it today. Our focus remains in three essential areas; one, steel, obviously, we first and foremost sort of low cost efficient steel producers, so wherever we can infuse our culture and our experience, the turnaround in existing operations, strengthen the market that will be a major continued focus. Our folks are extremely good, obviously advanced stream sort of processing and so that is a focus. And thirdly, pull-through opportunities at least utilize their own steel and pull-through the supply chain to increase our through cycle utilization is a focus. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen. Please go ahead with your question. Novid Rassouli : You had relatively upbeat comments regarding the automotive market, both this morning as well as last and in the release. I was just wondering if you can provide some detail regarding some of the commentary and the release last night; you mentioned gaining momentum in the automotive sector? And then any comments on development or progress on the Columbus automotive direct sales initiative? Mark Millett : Specific to auto, I think we gained incredible traction. I think a day before that [ph] put sort of direct auto team together and restricted our focus not away from but parallel to our primary or original sort of supply chain through processes. But that direct approach has been very, very positive for us; we -- I think shipped about 220,000 tons of automotive from Columbus just last year which is a massive increase and we're on platforms to increase that to about 400,000 tons over the next 18 months as new platforms come into play. So it's firstly the capability of the mill down there and we have a great team, I think is building confidence in the auto producers and they are also very, very confident about our balance sheet and partnering with us and our partnership is going to last 5, 10, 15 or 20 years; I think that strengthened our position. Theresa Wagler : I think some of the European automotive production really appreciate our sustainability model as well and if that pull cycle or pull-through sustainability of our older cycle; so I think that [indiscernible] in a relationship perspective. Novid Rassouli : And the auto-mix is still around 15%; is that about right? Theresa Wagler : Yes, that's about right, that's correct. Novid Rassouli : And the ultimate target; you guys have a target in mind for the percentage of mix of auto-shipments? Mark Millett : I think we're pretty well there at Butler, I know that 30% of our output is going into automotive, again principally through processors. And I'd like to see automotive at Columbus at round about 420,000 tons and capital [ph]. Novid Rassouli : If you guys could just help out how you're thinking about metal margins into 1Q and throughout 2018; it looks like we should see a decent uptick in 1Q but any thoughts around metal margin would be helpful. Thanks. Mark Millett : Again, looking long-term, the scrap environment comment more but we look at a relatively steady scrap environment through the year going forward. Obviously, a little tight on the [indiscernible] this past month as the weather impacted flow and Turkey [ph] came in the market. But absent any massive impact from Turkey [ph], I think we're looking at scrap kind of sideways through the year and I believe that on the product side things are going to get tighter than they are today, it's incredibly good -- sort of macro environment. You've got generally a global environment that's been more positive than we've seen in many years and you've got stronger demand within China, their pricing continues to go up, the Asian arbitrage is not attractive currently. European pricing is probably higher than on a diluted basis today than their domestic pricing. So the global environment is very positive; you've got positive demand trends domestically, silver center inventories are relatively low. OM [ph] is surprisingly buoyant along with coking coal, so the raw material push for the integrated increased the global cost of coke and I believe influence are going to continue to moderate. So from a pricing perspective, I see pricing that continued an upward trend. So spreads in general, longer term, they are going to be positive. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Messy [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Now let me ask this on recycling; we've been hearing a lot about issues with transportation, the effects there in the scrap market is straightway popping, driver something for better pay, and if you have the weather in the east and the southeast, apparently we can have with some equipment in New Year. I guess first; what's been the effect in your own recycling ops on these transportation stresses, if any? And then second, how was truck availability, your steep changes in freight or both, how is that effective deliveries are caused and the other frictions among the rest of your system whether internally or among customers? Russ Rinn : Certainly we've experienced the same issues that you talked about. Yet again, although it extends back to the change in the rail systems and in different functions the major rail rigs are taking the major rail where they serve us is actually pushing the smoother trait [ph] on the trucks which is making it a little bit more demand and has increased the bubble of the cost and the availability. I think long-term we do operate some of our own fleet, we do also operate some of our own rail cars, I think we want to position to be able to take -- to maximize our efforts in it but I think it is going to be a problem, we are going to see -- continue to see issues with primetime and retain drivers, both internal and also I think the trucking companies fall in line as well. So I think it's going to be an industry-wide issue that we all have to face which is higher rate cost more importantly. Unidentified Analyst : Now let me switch over and ask a little bit of fabrication; you've talked about solid backlog, encouraging customer engagement, etcetera. If all your volume is up impressively 25% year-over-year, clearly pricing hasn't been able to keep up though with the benchmarks in steel and so you're down year-over-year in dollar terms on operating margin. Can you help me square the health of the market with that profitability crunch? I mean are your customers undercutting you with cheaper sourced pre-fab steel? Are you being more aggressive on price to take the share -- what's the situation that's unfolding? Russ Rinn : We have the flexibility in the raw material we use, and there are times which are advantageous for us to use more collateral versus merchant. And as the spread has increased between merchant and flat roll, some of our advantages has deteriorated at that. The market is healthy, the demand is strong, it's literally just a matter of merchant not keeping pace with flat roll, we leverage flat roll more with our competitors, so our competitors have tended to hanging down the amount of merchant number and not necessarily allowing us to use much -- increase price as much with the care thing [ph]. Theresa Wagler : Matt, I would just add; if you think about it from the fabrication, from order or kind of from bidding to work to deliveries, it probably about 8 to 12 weeks in that timeframe until with that the steel prices add their marking up consistently which flat roll has really done pretty much this year; it's hard to catch up but then once you're not in stability, not where the team and the fabrication side really has the opportunity to pass that through. Unidentified Analyst : Do you think that type of stability both in raw material costs and then, also I guess what pricing you're able to push through as you expect that to show up as you move over the next couple of quarters? Theresa Wagler : Obviously. Mark Millett : I think to highlight that business, the team has done a phenomenal job leveraging our national footprint there. And yes, we don't have record possibility, we have record shipments, the team continues to gain market share and I think 2018 is going to be a very good one for us. I think again, it's also a lot of optimism for us because inside into the non-residential construction arena that continues in online to be incredibly strong and growing. Russ Rinn : Our perspective there has probably never been as obvious as we enter '18. Our backlogs in the east are -- initially out of the country are flat to slightly down while our backlogs in the west are starting to be well over 30% higher than they started last year. So we're better positioned to follow up wherever they maybe than ever before. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David [ph] with BMO. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Obviously, you know, forward-looking expectations imply a big rebound in results which makes sense given everything going on, given your comments on this call but just to try and make sure we have the timing and the trajectory of that. Recovery reasonably calibrated, I have four questions; first, given the insights you have on order books, product mix, can you give us more color on the magnitude of the expected volume recovery in 1Q '18 versus 4Q '17? Second -- I'm just going to rattle these off and then you can just answer them. Second, I think the steel operation segment EBITDA per ton in the first quarter of '17 was $106. Given the current environment, given the shifts in your product mix; should we expect 1Q '18 EBITDA per ton to be higher than that 176 figure from the prior year? Third question, can you just remind us again, how much of your volume has some pricing lags; I think there are some with two to three month lags? And then the fourth, what's the total expected capital spending for 2018? Theresa Wagler : I'll try to shape-in but I'm afraid we're not going to help build the monologue with detail but -- I'll start with the order book and the magnitude has changed from a volume perspective. We don't give specific guidance related to that and I think that helps to understand that but what I would say is that we are expecting volume improvement in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter; one, because the seasonality in the fourth quarter and the second is because we had probably at least 500,000 tons of less flat roll shipments because of the plant outages which -- actually we're very successfully completed I think sometime in your writing mention that we longer than anticipated, it wasn't, they were just longer outages because there were some additional work to be done. So all in all, the flat roll will expect higher volumes, we think the market is strong and we're expecting to see the higher volumes of fabrication are exceeded along product side as well, the magnitude of which we all provided on the call. From an EBITDA per term perspective, again, we try to give directional guidance and so we believe that there is definitely a pricing momentum on the flat roll side which helps to beat some of the long product side as well and SBQ is doing really, really well; we're seeing a lot of strides in that market. And so with that we would expect to see -- it would be anticipatedly higher average pricing again with lateral coming back as well. And on the scrap side, the scrap is high right now so we can see scrap -- these -- at least higher prices for a bit but then we see it moderate throughout the rest of the year; so I would like you all decide what you think will happen the first quarter. Related to the lag in orders for flat roll are probably closer [ph], 50% now of the volume that is lagging to CRU index; so that really lags initially about two to three months. So that's the lag on the flat roll side now and on SBQ, it's still very small, maybe 15% tied to some sort of tightening. So otherwise, we're definitely still in the spot -- spot market company. And then as a release to 2018 capital expenditures, we would expect to be somewhere around $250 million for the year and that includes about $80 million to $85 million remaining from both the round of rebar investment and then the structural rebar investment as well; and we tend to have about $100 million to $120 million that we would call not sustaining and the rest of that are efficiency project. So looking at the steel notes, we have some in fabrication as well. That could change during the year as the team continues to develop projects but right now that would be our best estimate. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful, thank you. I'm not trying to ask you to build the model out, just trying to avoid the risk of irrational exuberance; so any color is helpful. I appreciate it, thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : So the question on your outlook for electrode cost please; I know you commented on the last quarterly call as well but can you give us a bit more color on where your 2018 contract settled and both when and by what scale you expected to hit your P&L? Just thinking back, over the last quarter we saw spot prices for electrodes pull back quite meaningfully in late autumn and then rally once again, did that ultimately change your pricing expectations versus when we last spoke? Thank you. Mark Millett : I think we're still in line with what we said on the last call. And fortunately our long standing relationships with the current electrode produces positive for us and we have committed supply for the year. About roughly half of our supply is sort of contracted on a fixed price for the year while the other half is still on a quarter-by-quarter basis. The impact to us is probably in the region of about $8 per steel ton year-over-year '18 versus the last year; so it's still well less than 1% of our conversion rate. Seth Rosenfeld : And just a separate question, going back to the flat steel division; I know for a while -- now you've been talking about that business basically operating at max utilization; we continue to see volumes kind of surprise in upside. I'm wondering if you can comment on what sort of incremental volume growth is realistic in flat or on the other side of the coin, with the mix improvement at both Butler and Columbus, might that actually lead to lower yield looking forward? Thank you. Mark Millett : Well, the team always surprises for the positive. The Butler facility -- again, record production last year, right after 20-plus years of operation and every year they improve and improve and improve. So Butler, I wouldn't say standout, it's still going to ease out a little bit but it's getting there. On the Columbus side, our focus for the past couple of years has been more product development, product diversification, getting into new markets and we're there today, and also -- more on our cost structure; the shift there will be in productivity across all the different lines and there are round about 3.1 million tons last year or so. Typically, we've been able to get 10% more out of our assets. All right, Barry [ph] is smiling at me across the table here but again, that's -- it's a phenomenal facility and I'm sure we can stretch that one, yes. Theresa Wagler : I would just kind of summarize; that we actually have over three -- probably close to 350,000 tons of extra capacities and today on the flat roll side and that's improved in value added mix as we start to ramp up the paint line which is still not being utilized fully, we don't get there by the middle of next 2018 results volume and upgrade at margins capability but we also have off our 300,000 tons of SBQ which is our second highest margin product, that's available based on 2017 shipments. And you have about 700,000 tons in the [indiscernible] between structural and rebar [ph]. So we've got close to 1.4 million tons of additional latent capacity network fall of it that's still available to us and that's without additional projects that tend to come about from time to time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris [ph] with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : A quick question just on the tax rate changes; so you guided to 24% to 25% going forward. So for the books rate, in terms of the CapEx changes on the 100% CapEx expensing and the rate measurement you've done now on deferred tax assets and liabilities; what -- how do we think about the cash tax rate going forward? Is that going to be pretty close to the book rate or is there some deviation over 2018? Theresa Wagler : It could be slightly less than 2018 with the expensing of the fixed asset but not appreciably though I would still stay in that range. From a modeling perspective, I think you will be closer but there could be some reduction and again, just depends on the CapEx spend. So right now you know how they ignore that and I would say we're somewhere around 24.5%. Unidentified Analyst : Just in terms of the talk of NAFTA and I noticed you chatting earlier about the plans with the ode of exposure at the Columbus mill; how do you think about any potential renegotiations and how that might end up? Mark Millett : Again, being a little speculative but I believe the negotiations are -- kind of ongoing. I think they meet in (Montreal yesterday or today) I do believe. I think if you look at the trade balance and the importance of Canada, maximum to the U.S., it is an extreme issue for that agreement to be council, I'm sure it's going to be negotiated, I'm sure it's going to be modified to some degree, it's 25 years old, so it probably needs some tweaking. But we're quite confident that [indiscernible] Mexico is going to continue to strike. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Timna Tanners : I just want to follow up on the capital allocation question to the extent that you can provide any color there I know. On the last call I had in my notes, you were talking about aggressive buybacks while you were waiting to deploy cash and this quarter seemed to slow down so maybe I misinterpreted but I just want to ask about that and then see if I can get a little bit more color from you on the types of opportunities you would consider? Theresa Wagler : From aggressive buyback perspective, Timna, we do have opportunistically and systematically really had to do more with the program that we had in place and so I would more efficiently -- we plan to finish the current authorization of $173 million and we re-evaluate from that point forward depending on where we are. We feel this is same as we did back in three or four calls, so I wouldn't read anything into that, so that's the only one existing way back in the fourth quarter. Mark? Mark Millett : And from a standpoint of transaction, again, I'm not going to elaborate anymore other than the focus is steel. It is sort of value added processing and pull through sort of volume type opportunities. Theresa Wagler : And note, there are opportunities that are sizeable, so that's\u2026 Timna Tanners : And you had said in the past that you could look at several deals adding up to a value that resumes kind of the leverage that you've had in the past with your recent debt metrics kind of it -- what we calculated to be 11-year lows; is that still the case? Theresa Wagler : I don't know, I haven't calculated in 11-years, this is our 25th year anniversary. So I would say that Tenor [ph] is a completely different company, both in size and capability and so it's natural that our credit metrics have improved because in the past we've not let dilute shareholders, by issuing equity we really prefer to use that market to -- we're very thankful and very supportive with it. So I do believe that there are deals that will put additional leverage on the company but at a very appropriate position. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael [ph] with JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : I have a question on one of your competitors with those announced acquisitions [indiscernible]. I'm just wondering, how do you view the implications with Steel Dynamics not just on the fabrication\u2026 Theresa Wagler : Michael, I'm sorry you are cutting out. Can you -- we only heard -- I think if you want to ask the question about the CMC acquisition but we couldn't hear anything after that. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, on the CMC acquisition I was just wondering the implications that you see if any on your scrap business, rebar business and the fabrication business going forward? Mark Millett : On the scrap business Michael, there is no real overlap of influence. Russ? Russ Rinn : I think from our perspective I don't think it changes the landscape to a great degree. I think to begin they are not necessarily in our footprint, those acquisitions and I think again, as all opportunities in scrap, if we've got it available at the right price they will buy from us, if we don't they won't. Mark Millett : And I think on the product side Michael, the supply and demand balances are changing just as the nameplate on the company so to speak. It is positive that CMC has started to get into a little more -- sort of coil remodel and again, that actually helps us as customers do like optionality and I think it's going to improve our profile there. Unidentified Analyst : And on the fabrication? Theresa Wagler : The fabrication is a different type of fabrication Michael. So what we do in choice with that arena is that what CMC does with their fabrication, so I think there will be no impact. Mark Millett : Yes, as we enter our push is to supply to independent sort of third-party fabricators, we're not coupling our output of rebar to actual fabrication itself. So it really sets us aside from our new core and CMC competitors in rebar. Unidentified Analyst : Just going back to the 232 Mark, what would you think is the best outcome in terms of the format for 232? Mark Millett : I've had a conversation with some folks in the industry and they put a matrix together and I think there were a dozen of different speculative outcomes and as I suggested the group, I think it's a [indiscernible] because who the hell knows what is going to be presented. I do believe it's a combination or individually but tariffs and/or quotes [ph] -- but again, it's speculative for us to comment. Unidentified Analyst : Based on historical patterns, it's kind of one of the few ways if not the only way to get around the circumvention issue if you include the existing tariffs that are out there -- basically everybody is the only way to address this circumvention which I think is the heart of the issue? Glenn Pushis : I would agree. We were very excited that the circumvention case got traction like it did, our ultimate further case is to help that but in a sense it's much like we mentioned in the past, it's [indiscernible] that you got to go and file these cases, it takes a lot of time and money to research every one of these; so 232 would be a broader and swifter action if they were in fact to cover some of these things but we're going to diligently pursue the remedies we're on and things that we can control in the meantime hoping to see what resolution is brought forth by the administration. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question. Phil Gibbs : Mark, I had a general question on the energy markets in terms of what your customers are telling you there and any color you can provide on the SBQ feel backlog momentum in that light? Mark Millett : The momentum is -- I would say is almost incredible. Across all spheres, all segments with the exception of agriculture. I think energy is surprising us and we're getting some customers back today, particularly in the heavier diameters with 3-inch to 6-inch which has gone into the seamless pipe; so that is a good sort of tailwind for us. Afterload equipment our customer base is indicating some pretty massive growth, like 20% plus this year as is the truck industry. So I think generally and we've always said in the past that energy rebar tends to be for us sort of a bad weather indicator to the steel consumer and economy as a whole; and when that kicks in, it brings me a lot of confidence, a lot of optimism going forward. Phil Gibbs : And any color on the SBQ backlog Mark relative to maybe last quarter? Mark Millett : Backlogs are up. Glenn? Glenn Pushis : Yes, they are slightly up, it's robust. So spend good past six months for sure. Phil Gibbs : And Theresa, any color you can provide on the flat roll mix in Q4? Theresa Wagler : No, I apologize. So for the fourth quarter, we had rolled anti-no [ph] shipment for 869,000 tons, so for the total year it was 3,530,000 tons. For cold roll it was 112,000 tons in the quarter, where a total of 527,000 tons for the year. And for coated [ph], it was 678,000 tons or a total of 2,880,000 tons for the year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please go ahead with your question. Charles Bradford : Question about the expansion rebar project at Columbus city; the capital cost -- I think you mentioned $80 million more to go but what's the total cost for that capacity? Theresa Wagler : I'll check and start, [indiscernible] has confused everyone. There is two rebar project; the one at Rono [ph] which will be starting here at the first quarter, that will be $28 million; and the one [indiscernible] in total, that will be $5 million. So it's a total of about $107 million for those three of our projects and there are some carryover into next year for that capital but the total for Columbus city is $75 million. Charles Bradford : But given some of your competitors adding new rebar capacity, it stands still higher capital cost than what you seem to have. What kind of operating cost advantage do you expect? Mark Millett : Significant. I think you hit the nail on the head and that's why organic opportunities for us are so effective. And one has to recognize not only is the installation or the overhead cost low for the installed tons but the added utilization, you know, you add 250,000 tons to a mill that's doing 1.3 million last year, the overhead across all tons comes down dramatically. So the return is incredibly attractive. Theresa Wagler : Yes, for the structural mill there is the 500,000 tons of additional full capacity with the three initiatives that Mark mentioned earlier and one pending the growth to the rebar division, the second is the [indiscernible], and the third component of the most significant in volume is this rebar project which to come online into this year. If we increased capacity at the structural division better than in ton, that's about $20 to $25 per ton benefit in cost conversion across all the volumes; so it is really meaningful to have these initiatives in place. Charles Bradford : Do you have a figure for what your total shipments to what AISI [ph] called military and other ordinance might have amounted to last year? Theresa Wagler : Chuck, I'm sorry. If it was informed me, I would have no idea, I would have no way of guessing. Charles Bradford : On an area that maybe a little bit more significant; your focus on the automotive, do you have any information on what the difference might be between the steel content of an electric vehicle made by someone like General Motors versus a more standard vehicle maybe in percentage terms or whatever measure you might have? Mark Millett : I'm looking around the room, we're all shaking our heads to be specific and not give you a number. Glenn Pushis : It depends on the type of automobile but also the types of seals, so while flat roll may decrease slightly, we may see an increase of SBQ in those cars but the transmissions in the drive trains; as far as the flat roll; still we do anticipate some material changes. So the net effect will be a smaller content with steel in most cases but it does change because without the big engine and there are some structural members of the car they are added; so we're more interested in what the net changes and the type of parts and where our seals can find happy homes in these cars in the future. So while the content may shrink a little bit, we look at opportunities growing both of SBQ and flat roll to fill these new needs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Sean Wondrack : When we think about moving forward into the next few months with scrap looking to be sort of sideways as you explained and your lag to basically realizing the higher sales prices; should we expect kind of that dynamic to move in the right direction where you should have steel prices moving a little higher but scrap being kind of move sideways? Mark Millett : I think we expect that over the longer term through these, yes. Sean Wondrack : And then just quickly -- somebody mentioned it earlier but your debt metrics are really strong at this point; I mean they are one turn net leverage, you generated a ton of free cash flow even after share buybacks, have you got in discussing with the rating agencies, you're right on the cusp of lessoning grade [ph]. Is there anything we should expect there or have you been speaking with them? Could you give us anymore color there please? Theresa Wagler : Yes, we had an active dialogue with the agencies, we have to really track their relationship with them, and so we're now -- I agree with you, our credit metrics are partly strong and definitely I would say they are investment grade today and frankly, when you look at our issuances on the debt market and the capital market, we're getting very good pricing there as well. But the idea that we're really are traditional right now is transactional growth and transactional growth that we think could be meaningful. We really do want to use our balance sheet versus our equity or [indiscernible]; and so I think right now it's more of a unique timeframe where we're positioned from going over thinking there is growth opportunity that we just kind of --we're having conversations with them that we feel pretty good at where we are at the moment. Operator : Okay, thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you, Brenda. And thank you for those that may still be on the call. I think I will look our position as a company is phenomenal as we move into and through 2018. We have a general upward momentum for the markets in general, SDI has been outlined, we have a considerable number of sort of internal catalysts, earnings catalysts that differentiate us from our peer group I do believe. And then any two sections to clear two action, our infrastructure bill is just going to compound that and be cream on the top. So we're looking for a phenomenal year and we want to share that with you all and any customers and employees, any community members on the call too; thank you for your support, we can't do this without you all and we were just recently by Fortune Magazine what everyone wants, worlds most admired, or one of the most admired companies; again, we have almost 8,000 employees driving -- drive us towards that and thank you all. Have a good day, be safe. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. Good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings call. As always, we truly appreciate your time this morning and look forward to sharing our great start to the year. The entire SDI team drove an exceptional safety and operational performance. And event at 25 years, our innovative spirit prevails. Butler, our very first steel facility is still achieving a new record or new record production levels as are the Columbus, Structural and Rail and Engineered Bar divisions. We also received recognition from the Steel Manufacturers Association for last year's safety performance at our Columbus, Structural and Rail, Roanoke Bar and Techs Steel divisions, so congratulations to all the folks. But to begin this morning, Theresa will comment in more detail about our first quarter results. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for your time today. I also want to thank the team for safe and incredible first quarter performance. Our first quarter 2018 net income was $228 million or $0.96 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $201 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 and $305 million or $1.28 per diluted share in sequential fourth quarter. Excluding the one-time tax benefit in the fourth quarter and refinancing cost, the fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $0.54. Our results were above guidance of between $0.88 to $0.92 per share due-to-higher than expectation March flat roll production and shipment. The Butler and Columbus team truly executed at exceptionally high level, each exceeding monthly production records in March. We achieved record revenues of $2.6 million in the first quarter driven by our steel operations. Operating income increased 65% to $323 million compared to the fourth quarter, a solid performance by everyone, although the steel platform drove the increase. For the first quarter 2017, steel shipments increased 7% sequentially to a record 2.5 million tons with growth achieved at each division across the platform. Steel metal spreads expanded meaningfully as our average quarterly sales price increased $61 to $822 per ton and our average scrap cost consumed only increased $21 to $321 per ton. The result was first quarter steel operating income of $338 million, a sequential 65% improvement. For our metals recycling platform, ferrous metal spread improved in the first quarter with a 7% increased in shipments related to higher domestic steel mill utilization, resulting in operating income of $28 million, a 24% improvement sequentially. We are effectively levering the strength of our vertically integrated model, which benefits both the steel mills and the scrap operations. The metals recycling group shipped 65% of their ferrous scrap to our own steel mills, increasing scrap quality, mill efficiency and reducing working capital requirement. First quarter 2018 operating income for our fabrication operations decreased slightly to $20 million as improved average selling value were more than offset by seasonally lower shipments. The March order backlog is strong and higher than it was at this time last year. This coupled with customer optimism supports our belief in continued demand strength in 2018. However, higher raw material field costs are likely to significantly compress margins in the second quarter of this year. During the first quarter 2018, we generated cash flow from operations of $178 million. Operational working capital grew 199 million, based on overall market improvement resulting in higher customer account and inventory values. Additionally, there are several annual payments made in the first quarter of each year such as company-wide profit sharing and annual performance-based incentive compensation which this year required cash payment of over $130 million in the quarter. First quarter capital investments were $51 million. We currently estimate full year 2018 capital investments to be in the range of $250 million. We increased cash dividends by 21% in the first quarter. This follows increases of 11%, 2% and 20% in '17, '16 and '15 respectively, demonstrating our confidence in the strength of our through-cycle cash generation. We also repurchased $69 million of our common stock during the first quarter and have $103 still available pursuant to the $450 million board authorized program, which we initiated in October 2016. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We maintain liquidity as $2.2 billion of March 31, 2018 with $1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.2 million is available funding under our revolving credit facility. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with the strong credit and capital structure profile provides meaningful opportunity for continued organic and transactional growth. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. And for those of you that track our flat roll shipments by type, in the first quarter, we had shipments for hot-rolled and P&O of 875,000 tons. We had cold-rolled shipments of 134,000 tons and we had coated which includes both galvanized, Galvalume, and painted products of 734,000 tons. Thank you, Mark? Mark Millett : Superb. Thank you, Theresa. Well safety is and always will be in the fabric of our company our number one priority. During the quarter, we've reduced the total recordable injury rate a further 14% as compared before the year 2017 with the 84% of our locations achieving zero recordable injuries. The team really is doing a great job and you have my sincere appreciation. But as I do every day, I challenge all of us to remain focused and to keep moving towards our ultimate goal of zero injuries everywhere. The steel platform executed extremely well, achieving record quarterly shipment. As mentioned, several divisions attained record production and shipping records. We also continue to develop new product capabilities adding to one of the most diversified and value-added product portfolios in the industry. As a result, we operated at the utilization rate of 94% during the first quarter, once again markedly better than the domestic industry rate of 76%. With 11.4 million of annual shipping capability, we still have 1.2 million tons of annual latent capacity to sell as the markets continue to strengthen. Domestic still consumption remains strong in the automotive and construction sectors, while energy and general industrial demand continue to grow. The automotive sector is not turned over as some expected with the current 2018 growth expectations for both the U.S. and Mexico, more than offsetting any possible contraction in Canada. We continue to gain automotive market share at the Columbus Flat Roll division, driven by a focus on automotive direct sales and leveraging our cost advantage related to free costs into Mexico. As mentioned on the January call, increased demand for special bar quality steel also continues, which supports our belief in the broader industrial sector momentum. In fact, our Engineered Bar Products Division achieved record quarterly shipment level, and we have some 200,000 of additional capacity yet to leverage as demand grows. We continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future through the new investment and our existing operations, a few notable investments occurred in 2017 which will continue to show incremental benefits in the coming year. An $18 million investment to add bit galvanizing capacity in our Steel of West Virginia plant started up in September as this value-added service is ramping up very, very well, a $15 million investment that upgraded our Butler Flat Roll Division's galvanizing line while also adding 180,000 of value-added coating capacity. The $100 million investment in the new paint line at our Columbus Flat Roll division began operating in the first quarter of 2017. The line provides 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and diversification into some of our highest margin products. Complementing our two existing paint lines in Indiana, this line is state-of-the-art facility producing high-quality HVAC, appliance and double-wide steel. This location facilitates lower costs logistics for the Southern U.S. and Mexico markets. Columbus ship 36,000 tons of painted products in the first quarter of 2018 and the team is on track to be running at 90% capacity by mid-year 2018. Columbus continues to be significant earnings catalyst and I believe the changes have been transformation and there is still more to come. We would expect production gains, continued value-add product mixed shifts and additional cost savings. The successful market and product diversification achieved over the last three years is one the key differentiators for our improved through cycle profitability. Relative to long products, the improving construction and industrial markets coupled with our organic initiatives resulted in increased capacity utilization of our long product steel mills to 80% for the quarter. We have three specific organic initiatives to increase the through-cycle utilization at our Structural and Rail Division. First, we are growing the production of SBQ quality blooms to send to our Engineered Bar division, which currently is still short and needs blooms to fully utilize its rolling capability. This will improve through-cycle utilization of both facilities. During the first quarter, the team shipped over 36,000 tons, an annual run rate of 144,000 tons for year, which is well on our way to the anticipated transfer of over 200,000 tons in our recently strong SBQ market environment. Second this year, we further diversified the product offerings to include large equal and unequal length angles. We plan to eventually sell 100,000 tons annually, but we\u2019re just entering these markets. Third, we are investing $75 million to utilize existing access melting and casting capability there. The expansion will further diversify our product portfolio and market exposure through the annual production of 240,000 tons of reinforcing bar, which will include spooled, custom cut-to-length and smooth bar. Our intended business model should substantially enhance the current supply chain, providing meaningful logistic yield and working capital benefits to the customer. In addition, we will be the largest independent rebar supplier to the Midwest region. We\u2019re on schedule to begin operations there in the first quarter 2019. In aggregate, these three initiatives provide over 500,000 tons of additional annual shipping capability at the Structural and Rail Division. It will provide a material improvement in future through-cycle utilization and profitability. We\u2019ve also investing $38 million to utilize excess melting and casting capability at our Roanoke Bar Division. We\u2019ve added equipment to allow multi-stand slitting and rebar finishing of 200,000 annual tons. Similar to our Mid-West investment, we expect to have strong market penetration as we will be one of the largest independent producers of rebar in the mid-Atlantic region. But atypically, the project was delayed by several months due to some design and equipment issues. However, equipment commission is now in process and the team plans to begin selling products in June. Our metals recycling platform also had a strong quarter. Higher domestic steel mill utilization supported improved ferrous shipments and metal spread expansion. Prime scrap flows has been steady. And with a solid automotive build, we don\u2019t expect that to change. With better weather, we also expect obsolete scrap flows to improve. Good supply, coupled with a weak export environment, should sustain stable pricing as the year progresses and we believe there is more than adequate scrap supply to address the higher domestic steel mill utilization rates. The fabrication platform also delivered a solid performance, although profitability marginally decreased from seasonally lower shipments. Our order backlog remained strong heading into the summer construction season. The ongoing strength for this business and continues customer optimism is a solid indicator that the non-residential construction market is continuing to grow. Our fabrication operations continue to purchase steel from our own steel mills and the power of pull-through volume when we source steel internally from our own mills as a significant catalyst for a higher through-cycle steel utilization rates. This pull-through strategy remains one of our focuses for ongoing growth. We remain confident that market conditions were in place to benefit domestic steel consumption throughout the year. Domestic steel inventory levels remain reasonably balances, where steel demand and pricing have improved. Based on strong domestic steel demand fundamentals and customer optimism, we believe improving steel consumption will continue during the year. We also believe recent trade actions will result and reduced imports later coming months despite the first quarter uptick driven by temporarily exempted countries pushing in material prior to the May 1st deadline. Additionally, we believe tax reform will provide a stimulus for addition success at investment and growth. In combination with our expansion initiatives, we believe these are firm drivers for our growth in 2018. Our business model and execution of our long term strategy continues to strength our financial position through a strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms supports our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance differentiation and has provided an enviable balance sheet. The Company and the team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth. It is the team, our team that provides the foundation for our success and I thank each of them for their hard work and commitment and remind them safety is always our first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our customers for our company, employees and shareholders are like and look forward to creating new opportunities for us all in the years ahead. So again, thank you for your time today. And Christine, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Novid Rassouli : I first wanted to touch on Section 232 on imports. So given that all -- to my understanding, given that all exemptions with respect to 232 expire on May 1st, I guess excluding South Korea given the new agreement there, the market could extremely tight in the near term. Can you give us a sense of how this is impacting your customers, order book or the conversation that you're having with customers on this topic? Mark Millett : Novid, I think there is a sense of surprising comments right at the second. I would suggest, the order book obviously and the order input rate is strong, but no one is really panic of it. I do believe that you're correct, that there will be some tightness both from restraints on the flat rolled side and also the restraints on the imported pipe and tube, which will certainly tighten the hot-rolled coil market substantially. Novid Rassouli : And then just to follow up. On Engineered Bar, we saw nice uplift, up 12% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, it was a record quarter there. Can you speak to the drivers of that move and maybe the diameters where you're seeing the strength, utilization rates and your outlook for that business for the remainder of 2018? Mark Millett : Glenn, can give you the details on the product ranges and those sorts of things. I would say, just hopefully the marketplace there is very, very strong in all segments, agriculture, perhaps not so much. But in manufacturing, general industrial consumption, off-road equipment is strong, tractor, trailer build is strong. Energy obviously has returned with surprising speed and continues to strengthen there. So I think, generally, all the market sectors are showing great promise continued both strength and you\u2019ve seen uptick in pricing here recently. And so, it\u2019s for us to me it\u2019s kind of a bellwether of the steel consuming environment, and it\u2019s a very healthy one right now. So Glenn, on sizes and things? Glenn Pushis : Mark, I think that\u2019s well put. We\u2019re driving more into the automotive, which is the new mill that Barry and his team installed years ago. We\u2019re adding some capacity to our bar finishing and inspection arena and that bodes well for automotive. And we\u2019re seeing those mostly in the smaller sizes 2 5/8 smaller, which is driven by the automotive. But you\u2019re exactly correct heavy truck and trailer, mining, construction they\u2019re all strong right now. Mark Millett : As a reminder to everyone, we obviously put in an expansion about two years ago now on the smaller diameter bar stock of about 250,000 tons to take that facility up to 950,000 tons of annual capability. So the present sort of marketing environment is now allowing us to fully capitalize on that. As I said earlier, we have 200,000 tons of available shipping capacity there, that\u2019s being aided by a great job at the Structural mill and improving and getting their blooms into SBQ Engineered Bar quality status. And that will increase up to, as we say about 200,000 tons of annualize rate here in the coming months. Theresa Wagler : Yes, just for clarification, the total capacity of the facility is 950,000 tons per year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Korn : Looking back over your historicals, 2011, 2016, you all averaged EBITDA margin, I think, it was just over 9%. I think that\u2019s my calculations. The last couple of years, you reached 14%, 15%. Last 12 months shade under 14%. And I think we all, here, expect your profitability to widen nicely as you harvest the price over these next couple of quarters and then you\u2019re also getting all the investments we\u2019ve talked about, the new capabilities you\u2019re making. So Mark, what would make you happy as to, what type of margin level you think you could achieve over time once you\u2019re in place, once the expansions capability and capacity there. And barring that, like what metric would you look at? Is the per ton operating income? Where would you be happy that you\u2019ve achieved what you think the potential of the complex is? Mark Millett : Well, as the team sitting around the table would suggest, I\u2019m never happy so probably at any level. But at one time when we were just a company of steel mills in a very strong market, our margins were mid to upper-20s, and I think to get back there would be a good step. Matthew Korn : Alright, fair enough, maybe then the question for Russ. Russ, are you surprised at all that scrap hasn't moved higher than it has given the pricing trends? Look now in hot-rolled and in shredded, I think from 450 a short ton, and you look at recent history of that around 300-325. What's the limiting factor than the upside? Why wouldn't the strong tags been more of an upward pull? Is that export weakness or something else going on? Russell Rinn : No, Matt. Yes, I think you get it from ahead. I think predominantly the export market has waned here this fall or the starting last fall and continuing on in this spring. That's been the one driver here. There is certainly there is enough scrap in the U.S. to support the higher levels of production, but again without the export draw, it's kind of kept a cap on it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Chris Terry : Just interested in how customers are looking at the pricing dynamics as the prices have moved up. Are you seeing any reluctant on the buying? Are they waiting at all for potential corrections? Or are they just accepting at the price at this point based on the order book that you're seeing? Mark Millett : No, as I said, I think generally there really is a calmness and a balance out there. And there certainly is an acceptance at this moment of time. As we mentioned coming May 1st or there about if the market would to turn dramatically that could change. And I think through the year with the demand growth that we're seeing and the just the fundamentals in the marketplace and with the expectation the imports that we'll receive in the summer months, I think there is a longevity for sure at the pricing levels that we see today. And I think more importantly it's just not a matter of prices as you recognized where our margin business. And I think with that pricing resilience on the sell-side and to the Russ's point, we see stability in the raw material side and the scrap market side. So, I think the earnings profile is going to be attractive for the rest of the year. Chris Terry : On the last quarterly call, you spoke quite a lot about potential M&A opportunities. Can you just go through the last three months and how that's changed? And how you're looking at the world from here? Mark Millett : I don't think anything has changed. I think the pipeline of opportunities is still there. There are opportunities that the team is working diligently on. As we said in the past, we are taking a great disciplined approach. We're not going to be impatient or impulsive in anyway just because we had a very strong balance sheet. But the expectation will be that we will have transactional growth to complement the organic growth that we've already stated. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Seelaus & Company. Please proceed with your questions. Bretty Levy : You're gaining market share in automotive. Clearly, this Cliffs' plant coming up in Toledo, which is right on the Indiana border. Can you kind of talk about the opportunities as you see it and kind of what the discussion level has been between you and obviously, this new plant that is coming up to improve potentially your feedstock in terms of like market opportunities for Steel Dynamics? Mark Millett : Again, our position there, Brett, has not changed. We\u2019re very, very comfortable with the raw material supply profile we have in place today. OmniSource has approximately 6 million to 7 million tons of sort of collection processing distribution market and capability. And that is a reasonable, more than reasonable support for our mill needs. I think last quarter, we were around about 60%, 63% of our scrap needs were met by OmniSource. The rest obviously is coming from other parties in the marketplace. So, strategically, we don\u2019t necessary see an urgent need to get into any alternative. And I think we look at those as a pure, purely investment return opportunity. And our belief is that through the cycle unless you own the iron units all the way back to the mine, that the return profile is not attractive for us. If that were to change then we would think differently. Brett Levy : And then the second question is obviously you got a plan to grow, right now you\u2019re running at 12 plus times interest coverage. At some point, is there like an optimal timing to post-232 or something along those lines? Is there an optimal time, as you guys see it to go after, what you really want to go after I assume it\u2019s downstream? Mark Millett : We have three main areas of focus. One, being sort of steel itself, steel production whether that'd be greenfield or whether that'd be opportunities, acquisitions, whereby we can turn around underperforming asset. So steel is one focus, downstream processing is another. Our team seemed to have a sort of natural ability there whether that'd be on the sheet side, coating, painting those sorts of things. And even in the bar side, as Glenn mentioned earlier sort of value-add or inspection, turning, those sorts of things. So downstream is important to us. And then thirdly, opportunities where you have sort of intermediate processing type manufacturing that can provide pull-through volume to our steel mills because we\u2019re very cognizant of through-cycle profitability and cash generation, not just looking for stronger peaks, but also stronger troughs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Just start on the long product side of the things, please. Obviously, you've seen an impressive pick up in utilization rates over the past two quarters. And we saw from one of your peer says well, very strong growth in their domestic supply of long products. Can you just give us a better sense of what your outlook is on the margin side for long steel, which in general has lagged what was seen on the flat side to-date? Do you envision environment in which you could see long product margins playing catch up with flats in the months ahead? Or do you think that we're going to see those two kind of moving in lockstep looking forward? Mark Millett : I know Theresa may have a more detailed color. I would suggest we're at a little bit of an inflection point there. The last three years what we've seen kind of an erosion of that spread pretty consistently sort of gradual consistent erosion. And I think with slightly high utilization rates going forward with the strong order book, this was also momentum. We've seen I think on first increases across the spectrum of long products over the last few weeks. I think that will likely continue. Theresa Wagler : The only thing I would add, Seth, is that as you remember they're very different markets, not just between flat and long, but also within the long products themselves if you look at SBQ versus merchants and structural and then on then on long side as well. So I agree, I think we are expecting margin expansion throughout the year in the long products, but I'm not sure we try to correlate those with flat. I would just say that we are expecting pricing to be able to outpace any changes in scrap. Seth Rosenfield : And the second question, if I may on the fabrication side. Can you just give us a bit of sense in terms of demand and order trends? Following tax reform, are you already seeing a real tangible improvement in the orders? And where are you seeing that perhaps from a product perspective? Mark Millett : Chris? Chris Graham : Yes, we continue to see expansion in the construction where all of our indices we follow continue to indicate such. I would say that for what it's worth the Western markets have come to life in the last six months. Midwest, Upper Midwest has been strong not that anybody else has been weak, but those have been areas of the bigger market change. We just maintain a positive outlook on non-res. It's a healthy mix of institutional, commercial and big box continues. So, we steady as she goes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO. Please proceed with your questions. David Gagliano : Theresa, I just wanted to clarify in your opening remarks. I saw you mentioned upfront that you expect higher raw material costs translate to significant margin compression in 2Q versus 1Q. Did I hear that correctly? Theresa Wagler : That wasn't in specifically fabrication, Dave. It's just as -- if you think fabrication uses steel, right, and as we have an increasing steel cost, there is probably an 8 to 12 week lag. And so, you're going to start to see higher prices because they benefit from having lower prices well at the steel they purchased kind of late fourth quarter. Now, they're going to have first quarter prices hitting the second quarter and that we likely think will cause some margin compression in fabrication but only that segment. David Gagliano : Completely understood, okay, thanks for clarifying. Now back to the steel operation segment. Obviously a lot of moving parts on prices mix, scrap, things like that. I know you\u2019re hesitant to, typically to provide much sort of short-term specific commentary. But given the magnitude, the changes we\u2019ve seen. Can you just give us a bit of a sense as to the margin expansion magnitude in metal margin expansion that we should be expecting in 2Q with the order books and the lags, I mean the effectively, the order books that you have in place at this point? Theresa Wagler : We\u2019re not going to give specifics, Dave, but I appreciate the question. We do expect it to be meaningful and we expect it to be kind of across the steel ops. But more importantly, you\u2019re going to see, I think more of -- well, you\u2019re going to see expansion of flat-rolled side as well. And I think you can probably get to some of that on your own because scrap is a one month lag as you know, and you know that we primarily use busheling or prime scrap in the flat roll operations. And interestingly enough because of the dynamic with 323, we actually have -- our contracts are such that there's a minimum quality customers have to take and then there is a maximum available. And because of the tightness in the flat-rolled market, the customers have been taking the maximum available, which is meant that our contractual business is really closer to 55% of our total mix right now in flat roll. So you\u2019re going to see that lagging CRU price move into the second quarter, they\u2019re going to get benefit from that as well as we think will be moderated scrap platform. So, I think that there's positive drivers in the flat roll side and then we just spoke to long product side where we see drivers as well. Sorry, we\u2019re not comfortable these specifics. David Gagliano : No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Just a last related question, basically, you just said is it reasonable to expect product mix to be more a little bit heavier on the flat roll than the long product side sequentially? Theresa Wagler : Well, we would expect that we\u2019re going to see incremental flat roll shipments, but the Butler and Columbus had record production already in the first quarter. So, we think there is an incremental availability. But as you think about all the additional capacity that we have most of that in long products, so as we see improvements in mix, I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019re going to see it substantially one way or another, but there is more opportunity for volume uplift on the long product side market independent. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : Just taking a step back philosophically in light of the very strong market conditions we\u2019ve been talking about and watching this year. What does Steel Dynamics need in order to think about more substantial capacity additions and what you\u2019ve been planning prior to the big move in prices this year? What conditions, what visibility? Can you just give us a sense of how you\u2019re looking at those, the decision on that end? Mark Millett : Well, Timna, and honestly, I don\u2019t believe it has changed. We wouldn\u2019t necessary change our strategy on the Section 232 alone or tax reform whatever. We take a very long term view. We look at sort of through cycle metrics. So that the immediate, incredible optimism out there, it doesn\u2019t mean to say that we\u2019re going to be shifted in a different -- I think we've demonstrated now the business model that we've set since the very beginning of our company. And certainly with the position that we've made over the last seven, eight, nine years has put us in a good shape sort to leverage the current marketplace, and also even in better shape to whether any trough going forward. So, I think it's kind of steady as she goes. We're not changing our strategy materially. And anticipation is to put the balance sheet to work continue to even the most efficient the lowest cost steel producer right there and not just steel producer but fabricator and metal sheet cycler and drive superior financial metrics. Timna Tanners : Also you mentioned that May 1 of course, deadline for some of the temporary exemptions. Do you have any further thoughts on how that can play out because it's also seems that there are some negotiations of other countries that could receive the exemptions like Japan, and some that may see their exemptions change in the quotas? In your discussions with the extent that you have them at the White House, do you have any sense of how those might play out? Mark Millett : Well, it's a certainly a changing environment out there. But I think what we -- we're appreciative and we both appreciative and applaud the practice stance of the Commerce Department and the Administration for sure. Despite the recent spike in imports obviously there are whole bunch of countries that just took advantage of those exemptions and trust and push material onto our shores. But that will recede in the coming months, I think it's helpful that maybe step back a little bit and understand what we will looking for as an industry. And but we weren't looking for the elimination of imports, but play sort of fair playing field, whereby imports would return to a more normalized level 20% 23% of demand and get away from the 33% of demand that crushed our marketplace. And in doing so which is allowed for a more healthy domestic mill utilization rate that would in turn, allow the entire industry to have a better profitability profile and exceed their cost of capital so we can reinvest develop new products and be a better provider for the customer base. And to be honest when the first announcement came at, we were a little alarmed to the 25% blanket tariff. We actually along with others supported one of the other options that Secretary Ross presented and that was to the punitive on the culprits so to speak and levy a more normalized quarter on the rest of the world. But I think as time goes on, prudence is prevailing. And I do believe, even though you talk with the negotiations and press a more compromised position I think that's where we should be. A 28% a straight tariff across the industry, I believe would have really tighten the industry and perhaps even created a steel shortage. And again that's not what we want. We need a balanced approach so we can have reasonable pricing, reasonable spreads, reasonable profitability yet steel have a good supply for the manufacturing base in the U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Mark, you had mentioned that you had shipped 36,000 tons off the paint line at Columbus in the first quarter, and you think, you\u2019re going to be on track to do 90% by mid-year. Question is, do you this visibility in your backlog? Is this business that you want or you think, you can go out and win just some clarity on that would be helpful? Mark Millett : We currently are doing lots of trials that, believe it or not with the paint, there\u2019s many parameters are go into it. So, we\u2019re securing approvals for various pieces of business that we see ramp up schedules coming through especially through July, through the end of second through third quarter. So we have a confidence that the products we\u2019re making are being accepted by or customer base. And we're using this time with the, to develop some longer term relationships with products that new line allows us to make that we don\u2019t make another plan. So, we're little more judicious with what we\u2019re making there, but the pipeline looks good. And the quality that the team is producing is really going well. So, we\u2019re trying to have a managed entrance to the marketplace. Phil Gibbs : Second question I have is just on the raw materials situation right now and input cost environment. Mark, if you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on the cadence of consumable costs increases being the electrode and refractory situation, whether or not you\u2019re seeing that now or whether or not you expect to be staged in through the course of the year? And then also, is there any potential risk on pig iron imports from Russia right now given the geopolitical environment? Thank you. Mark Millett : Well, on the consumables, I think as we reported in past calls, Phil. On the electrode side, we picked up a couple of bucks a ton. I think in the first quarter and maybe we bought another $1 or $2 coming on through the second quarter -- four, sorry. Theresa Wagler : Yes, I know, it's okay. Actually, it's about -- well, between electrodes and refractories, we were up about $2 per ton in the first quarter sequentially. Any expectation if you remember, we still had some old supply versus the new contracts. So as we run into more of the new contracts for the divisions in the second quarter. We expect that to increase and then another incremental, probably $4 and then be very stable through the rest of the year. Mark Millett : But you\u2019re saying that\u2019s electrode and refractory. Theresa Wagler : That\u2019s electrode and refractory. Mark Millett : I was taking them one at a time, but yes. Phil Gibbs : And then also on that other sub-part to that question. Do you think, there is any risk on pig iron imports into the U.S. from Russia gave any geopolitical environment, we\u2019re seeing right now? Mark Millett : I think certainly there is some risk there. I think it looks like Brazil is ramping up some. What we\u2019re hearing that some of the producers had been sitting idly or actually talking about coming backup. So I think there is a slight risk on the geopolitical side with Russia. But again, you\u2019ve got the Ukrainians and the Brazilians, I think, that will fill in part of that deal, it could result in some price pressure. But again, that just remains to be seen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Olin with Longbow. Please proceed with your question. Chris Olin : Mark, I just wanted to make sure I understand the dynamics of global supply and the exemptions. It sounds like you do not expect imports to pick up months, over the summer months. But I guess, I'm curious the countries that are currently exempted. Are the mills in those regions not offering a very low price product right now? And then second to that. How do you think about where potentially the price floor is for maybe something like hot-rolled steel going forward? Mark Millett : The exempted countries if you take them off, you're not count Mexico, our NAFTA trading partners, they I think are balanced and its business is usual. We're not seeing any disruptions from a pricing perspective a materials flowing either way. Europe the landed price until recently has been sort of at par, if not higher than the State and that's probably changed the last month or two. But nonetheless, no real message impact from Europe. Australia, I think the exemption there was principally due to BlueScope's mills on the West Coast. So, we're not getting impacted there dramatically. But now, I strongly believe in the coming months through the summer you'll see imports receive for short. Chris Olin : And then just second to that, can you talk a little bit about trucking availability as capacity constraints or freight cost change the outlook for perhaps the raw materials or maybe steel product segments? Mark Millett : I think this continue pressure there is not inhibiting us from the business, right. Barry Schneider : I think certain freight areas, freight lanes and it will be real strong. But really requires us like we always have to work closely with the truck and rail service providers. And they did just regulations became into effect are being adjusted at the system. And the more, the better we are our place for the trucks to do business, the better we get service. So right now, it's daily work, I'm not going to say daily, but we're doing good, we're not having the shutouts or too many miss trucks at least for the flat side. Glenn? Glenn Pushis : On the long product line, it's challenging. Mark, I mean, both rail, our availability in trucking lane. To various points, some of the lanes are very open and can get some good rates too. Other lands are little more challenged. It's a daily fight, daily struggle, but we're working with our customers and working with the transportation companies. And we're continuing to fight through it. Chris Olin : Can I just ask how much of the volume goes through rail right now? Mark Millett : Well, across the Company, it used to be more than 50% by rail. It's probably closer to 50-50 right? Glenn Pushis : If I were to guess right now, it's probably close to 50-50 across all our steel sectors. Mark Millett : On the operating side? Glenn Pushis : On the operating side, right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cleveland Rueckert with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Andreas Bokkenheuser : It's actually Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. Can you hear me okay? Mark Millett : Yes. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Just a question on growth. You were obviously talking about capturing market share early in the call. Do you have a sense of the overall consolidated volume growth at the moment? How much of that is inorganic growth by via market share gains? And how much is affected with the end market growing? And maybe also give us a sense of where do you see the volume growth potential throughout the rest of this year. Is this mainly in construction? I think, you mentioned construction earlier or do you see potential better growth elsewhere? Mark Millett : The specific market share growth that we referenced is in automotive at Columbus. We\u2019ve gone from next to nothing to about 220,000 tons last year. And the team is on I think qualified for platforms over the next 18 months to take that up to about 400,000 tons a year. That will likely the, kind of where we\u2019d like to see it going forward 400,000 maybe 500,000 tons from that facility. And that will be sufficient market exposure from my perspective on automotive. On the long product side, I think most of the volume expansion is increased overall demand as opposed to very specific -- we are\u2026 Glenn Pushis : Across all sectors, yes. Mark Millett : We are picking up market share in certain specific pockets. But generally, it\u2019s volume, general volume increase. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please proceed with your question. John Tumazos : Is that reasonable to expect steel productivity in the mills, the output to rise about 1% per year due to innovation and productivity? And do you have any specific capital projects that might increase output in any of the product lines significantly more than a trend productivity rate? Mark Millett : Well, John, good morning. Well, I\u2019m not so sure we\u2019ve analyzed it as a percentage growth per year. As you know, our team seems to continue to be innovative as part of our culture. And year-over-year as you suggest, we do outperform. Butler amazingly, after 23 years continues to do that. But I think further output there, growth is incremental. At Columbus, we have, I think a material opportunity. Our focus for the team has been market diversification and product development, those arenas, and we haven\u2019t necessarily pushed that facility real, real hard. And it\u2019s around about nameplate capacity today. And so, it's the truth form that mill should be capable of a lot more. The major growth is necessary incremental of any existing line or mill, but the organic opportunities we outlined already. And the most specific being the rebar projects that should add about 450,000 tons of shipping capability to our portfolio. Mark Millett : Just as a quick reminder, we took Butler from 3 million to 3.2 million tons at the beginning for this year. And for Roanoke Bar, we actually moved from 600,000 tons to 720,000 tons. All related to some incremental initiatives. And with the truck and rail division, beginning 2019, they're likely to be closer to 2 million ton a year capacity versus a 1.8. So there are specific projects as Mark said, that's driving that. Right now, our total capability is 11.4 million ton but that's likely to be over 11.5 come 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please proceed with your questions. Charles Bradford : I haven't heard most recently about any problems with any cost. Are you seeing anything there and also how about for alloys? Mark Millett : No real concern relative to energy cost either power or natural gas for that matter. So everything is stable. On the alloy front, we are seeing an appreciation there. So again, I don't believe its material. Glenn Pushis : On the SBQ side, we pass it along with a surcharge mechanism, so we don't see on that. But we are seeing it as an [ADM] a little bit in the structural side, sure.. Theresa Wagler : Yes, Chuck. Most of the alloyed increase, we haven't seen a sequentially because alloys were higher kind of throughout 2017 beginning in the second and third quarter. If you look at year-over-year it's pretty substantive, but we really kind of already observed the higher alloy cost in the second half of '17. Operator : Our next question is a follow-up question from Phil Gibbs with Keybanc. Please proceed with your questions. Phil Gibbs : Mark, I just had a question on the rebar investment at Roanoke and I know you have touched upon it earlier. But can you just remind us what that changed on that investment are relative your initial timeline? And maybe a little bit more color on why? Mark Millett : Glen? Glenn Pushis : Yes, sure. This is Glenn. We've working with our supplier with that equipment. We have some engineering issues and some delivery issues on the equipment. So that push the project back four to five months a year. We've got the rebar outlet now that has been commissioned and we can successfully run rebar through that. But you really get the gain in the production with the larger reheat furnace. We're starting to make that furnace in here in the next few weeks, and we anticipate changing over to that furnace in the month of May, which will then give us reading capability of a higher tonnage per hour which will allow us to run the rebar there. Now in the past, we've run 50,000 60,000 tons a year of rebar of that facility. We'll be able to push like Tricia and Mark has said up to 200,000 tons at that facility of rebar per year. And at the same time get some incremental gains on some of our other merchant products because of the larger heating furnace. Mark Millett : And so we're not expecting that same performance at the structural, right? Glenn Pushis : No structural mill is actually a different supplier. And right now that project seems to be going very smoothly and it's on schedule. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing comments. Mark Millett : Well, again, I appreciate your time today, appreciate your support. I think we are well positioned to take advantage of the growing marketplace in all sectors. I think someone said, we\u2019re about to hit all cylinders and it\u2019s going to be a very good 2018 and 2019 for us. For the customers on the line, I certainly appreciate your support. And for our employees, guys and girls, you\u2019re doing a phenomenal job. Just keep safe, each and every day Thanks to everyone. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Fantastic. Thanks Theresa. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings call. We value your time and interest. The entire SDI team delivered I think a phenomenal operational and financial performance this quarter. The market has certainly helped, but one should not overlook the underlying growth and market positioning the team has achieved in recent years to take advantage of such a market. Through innovation and team work, we're still breaking records and think to continue to do so with our second quarter earnings at a record high. I'd like to offer a heartfelt welcome to our new Heartland family, they are a great cultural and business fit and we're excited to drive to new heights with them as well. We'll share more specific plans for Heartland after Theresa provides insight into our second quarter results. Theresa? Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter 2018 net income was a record $362 million or $1.53 per diluted share. This compares to income of $154 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017, and $228 million or $0.96 per diluted share in the sequential first quarter. Our results were above guidance between $1.46 and $1.50 per share due to higher than anticipated average flat roll pricing. The Butler and Columbus teams continue to execute exceptionally high levels, continuing to exceed numerous milestones. We achieved record revenues of $3.1 billion in the second quarter, 19% higher than our previous record reached in the first quarter. Higher sales reflected improved price in volume across the steel platform. Operating income increased 55% to a record $502 million compared to first quarter, a tremendous performance by everyone with steel platform driving the improvement. To note, on June 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Heartland, a Flat Roll steel processing company for $400 million, inclusive of $60 million of normal edge working capital. We funded the transaction with available cash. The final cash settlement is subject to customary working capital adjustments which will take place over the next several months. A preliminary allocation of purchase price has been completed which resulted in a preliminary step up of inventory in fixed asset value. The associated $12 million to $15 million negative impact to earnings will be reflected as an increase to cost of goods sold in our third quarter 2018 financial results. The current plan is to maximize galvanized steel sales of approximately 360,000 tons annually while building cold rolls and P&O sales during the next 6 to 9 months, reaching an average annualized total run rate of 800,000 to 900,000 tons by mid-year 2019. The through-cycle EBITDA estimate of $50 million to $60 million has been continued sourcing of substrate from third-party from much of the volume. We are very excited with the addition of Heartland to our Midwest flat roll location. In a few moments Mark will share the numerous synergies and optionality that the assets bring to us. Back to our result for the second quarter of 2018 steel shipments increased 8% sequentially to a record 2.7 million tons. Even though flat roll volumes continue to improve, long product shipments experienced the most widespread increase especially in our structural rail division and wide plans being sale. Steel metal spread also expanded meaningfully across the platform as the average quarterly sales price increased $110 per ton to $932 in the second quarter and our average scrap cost consumed only increased $27 per ton. The result was record operating income from our steel operations at $537 million in the second quarter, a 59% sequential improvement. For our metals recycling platform improved domestic steel early utilization resulted in a 7% increase in ferrous shipment. The team also continued to manage operating cost very well. However based on higher unprocessed scrap procurement costs, the second quarter operating income decreased slightly to $26 million compared to $28 million achieved in the first quarter. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model which benefited first the steel mills and the scrap operations. The metals recycling group shipped 65% of their ferrous scrap to our own steel mills, increasing scrap quality, mill efficiency and reducing companywide working capital requirement. As we suggested on our first quarter call, our fabrication operations experienced slight compression during the quarter decreasing our operating income $6 million to $14 million as a benefit of higher average selling value and near record shipments were more than offset by increased steel cost. However the June order backlog remains strong and is higher than it was this time last year. This coupled with customer optimism supports our belief in continued demand strength through second half of 2018. During the second quarter the company generated strong cash flow from operations of $326 million. During the first half of 2018 we generated our second highest first half cash flow from operation of $504 million. Operational networking capital grew $354 million due to overall market improvement which resulted in higher customer account balances and inventory value. First half 2018 capital investments were $106 million. We currently estimate second half 2018 capital expenditures to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. We also expect to fund our recently announced $140 million galvanizing expansion with free cash flow as follows. In the second half of 2018 we\u2019re likely to fund about 25 million additional dollars. In fiscal year 2019 we\u2019ll spend approximately 95 million and then the remainder about 20 million will be spend in early 2020. We maintained our cash dividend for the second quarter at $0.1875 per common share. We also repurchased $180 million of our common stock during the first half of the year and at the end of the quarter we had $54 million still available pursuant to the $450 million board authorized program. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We maintain liquidity at $2 billion at June 30, with $810 million in cash and short-term investment and $1.2 billion of available funding under our new revolving credit facility. During the quarter we renewed our $1.2 billion credit facility and extended the maturity date and additional five years to June 28, 2023. Subject to certain conditions, we have the ability to increase the facility by a minimum of an additional $750 million which further supports our growth initiative. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with a strong credit and capital structure profile provides meaningful opportunity for continued organic and transactional growth. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Superb, thanks Theresa. Well as we often say safety is and will always be our number one priority at STI because nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. And certainly our performance remains well better than industry averages and its better than especially all the industry. And yes our 65% of our locations achieve zero recordable injury so far this year. But in aggregate, we saw an uptick in injury rates this quarter. They were minor yet but very, very avoidable and a message to our team to say this simply unacceptable. We must continue to be aware to think and to help each other remain safe at all times. It's an absolute imperative, and it's something - we should not be celebrating our operational financial records if we're not able to do it safely. That being said, steel platform continues to execute exceedingly well. We achieved record quarterly steel earnings in shipments and hit numerous production milestones. Underlying domestic steel demand is strong. Virtually every domestic steel consuming sector is either already good or strengthening. Our special-bar quality division, which we believe is our bellwether to the broader steel market, achieved another shipment record further supporting our belief in broader industrial sector momentum. We continue to position steel dynamics for the future through new investment in our existing operations. We recently announced the new $140 million galvanizing line at our Columbus Flat Roll division. This investment is another step of further diversification into higher margin products. In recent years, Columbus has transformed its product offerings through the addition of painting and galvanizing coating capability, and through the introduction of more complex grades of flat roll steel, some of which are of the automotive sector. The diversion of product to these value-added assets has reduced the amount of volume available to our existing galvanized customer base. So, the addition of two galvanizing facility will allow Columbus to serve these existing customers along with new customers in the region. This expansion will also reduce Columbus's exposure to the more cyclical hot-roll market, which will result in higher and less volatile through-cycle earnings. Construction of the line as planned will take place during the next 24 months with operations beginning mid-year 2020. Additionally, during the next 2 years, we plan to make additional investments at Columbus to upgrade certain mines and hot strip mill capability to further enhance and stabilize profitability with continued product diversification and process efficiency gains. Investments will increase Columbus's range of complex grade capabilities and will improve the process control needed to produce the best high strength steel grades used in the automotive industry and elsewhere. These new investments extend Columbus's strategies to diversify its value added capabilities. A recent 2017 paint line addition provides 250,000 tons of annual coating capability and diversification to some of our highest margin products. Complementing our two existing paint lines in Indiana, this line is the state-of-the-art facility producing high quality HVAC, appliance, and double-wide steel. This location also facilitates lower cost logistics for the Southern U.S. and Mexican markets. The Columbus paint line has been ramping up nicely, and had 90% run rate this past quarter. We're also investing in our long product steel operations, improving construction in industrial markets, coupled with the execution of some of these initiatives resulted in increased capacity utilization of our long product steel nodes in the second quarter to just over 90%. As a reminder, we have three specific organic initiatives to increase the utilization of our Structural Rail Division. First, we are growing the production of SBQ quality blooms to send to our Engineer Bar division, which needs blooms to fully utilize its rolling capability. This improves through-cycle utilization at both facilities. With over 43,000 tons of blooms shipped in the second quarter, we are well on our way to the anticipated annual transfer of over 200,000 tons. Secondly, this year, we further diversified our Structural Divisions product offerings to include large angles. The team is just beginning sales with a plan to eventually sell 100,000 tons annually. Lastly our $75 million investment to utilize excess melting and casting capability there is on schedule from first quarter of 2019. Expansion will further diversify our product portfolio and market sector exposure through the annual production of 240,000 of reinforcing bar, which will include spooled, custom, cut-to-length and smooth bar. Ancillary bar business model just substantially enhanced the current supply chain, providing meaningful logistic yield and working capital benefits for the customer. In addition, we will do the large independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region. In aggregate, these three initiatives provide a material improvement in future through-cycle utilization and profitability at this facility. We also recently invested $38 million at our Roanoke Bar Division to utilize the excess melting and casting capabilities. We've added equipment to allow the multi-stand slitting and rebar finishing of 200,000 tons per year. Similar to our Midwest investment, we expect a strong market penetration as we will be one of the largest independent producers of rebar in the middle Atlantic region. Commission of this equipment is underway, the plan is to increase rebar sales through second half of 2018 to 80% to 90% run rate. Steel platform teams are doing a great job and with the completion of the half than the acquisition a few weeks ago, we now have well over $12 million tons of annual shipping capability. We believe this acquisition will result in numerous future and benefits with the Heartland's current operations and to our broader Midwest flat roll group. Heartland is acquitted with a continuous pick line, a cold mill and a galvanizing line. Equivalent is fully upgraded and is in excellent operating condition. Historically, Heartland was operated at low utilization rates, focusing on galvanized steel. We plan to focus on a full breath of products including very light gauge sheet, our operating expertise, product market familiarity and a geographic proximity of our existing Midwest flat roll operations allows for meaningful value creation. Consistent with our strategy to differentiate ourselves and grow through product diversification, Heartland provides wider and lighter gauge product capability, diversifying our Midwest products in end markets. We are familiar with the market and customer base. Due to continued addition of value added capabilities at our Butler Flat Roll division, we\u2019ve displaced some of our customers that can now be supplied by Heartland. Heartland also provide pull-through volume. We plan to supply some of Heartland's required steel substrate from our Butler Flat Roll division, increasing through-cycle profitability at both locations. Heartland also improved Butler's cold mill productivity. We plan to have our lighter gauge flat roll that is made at Heartland, which will increase Butler's cold mill productivity. Lighter gauge products require more time to run and Heartland is better equipped to make these gauges. In whole, Heartland provides the unique margin enhancing opportunities to Steel Dynamics, based on our value added focus Midwest Flat Roll locations. We're excited to begin the immigration and value creation and once again welcome the Heartland family to the SDI family, so we\u2019ll have a great time. Our metals recycling platform, also delivered a solid performance, higher domestic steel mill utilization supported improved ferrous shipments. Prime scrap flows has been steady. And we don't expect that to change. Export of obsolete scrap should remain moderate, and as we also expect obsolete scrap flows to continue to improve, resulting in stable scrap prices for the remainder of the year. We believe there is more than adequate scrap supply to address higher domestic steel mill utilization rates. The fabrication platform also delivered a solid performance with second quarter shipments at near record levels. However high steel import cost more than offset the improved average sales price in higher shipments. Our overall backlog will remain strong. The ongoing strength for this business and continued customer optimism is a solid indicator that the non-residential construction market is continuing to grow. We remain confident, the market conditions are in place to benefit domestic steel consumption throughout the rest of this year. Domestic steel inventory levels remain reasonably balanced and imports will be under control. Based on strong domestic steel demand fundamentals and customer optimism, we believe steel consumption will continue to be strong throughout the year providing higher levels of metal utilization and extended lead times. In combination with our expansion initiatives, we believe there are firm drivers for our continued growth through 2018 into 2019. I'd like to also comment on the actions the U.S. Federal Government has recently made to restore financial health for the domestic steel industry, thereby providing a sustainable long term support to the U.S. manufacturing base. We support their attempt to create a more leveled playing field for the domestic steel producers and we have seen positive change. The industry continues to invest and create new jobs. We believe there has also been a market increase in the utilization of existing steel facilities. In particular, utilization of U.S. Flat Roll facilities has risen to [80%] to 85%. Steel companies are increasing jobs and weigh this across the country. Specific to SDI, our business model and execution of our long term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position to a strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer's focus coupled with market diversification and low cost operating platforms supports our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance in differentiation. The Company and team always will continue organic transactional growth. Our team provides the foundation for our success and I thank each and every one of them for their hard work and their commitment and remind them again safety is our first priority. We continue to focus on providing superior value for our Company, our customers, our employees, and our shareholders alike. And look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us in the years ahead. So again, thank you for your time today. And Melissa, we'd love to open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Terry : Couple from me on Heartland and then one on just capital management as well. Specifically on Heartland, the $50 million to $60 million EBITDA guidance, does that include the synergies of the logistical savings in the pull-through volumes that you've talked about? Mark Millett : No. I believe that will be the kind of the earnings rate of the facility onto itself. Time will tell, I think the number of synergies is quite extensive. As we looked at the investment premise for Heartland, they're modest facilitated synergies and strength. Obviously we're adding that volume and earnings without adding domestic capacity of 350,000 tons of coded capability there. The nameplate for the cold mill is around about 1 million tons. We're anticipating somewhere around 800,000 tons though as again as we said in the prepared notes our focus is on the lighter gauge products through the node. So, I think we'll be ramping up to 800,000 tons of all through 2019 into midyear. So I think it\u2019s great additional volume. It\u2019s diversifying our product mix. It\u2019s a 72-inch wide facility. It\u2019s capable of loader gate substrates. We\u2019ll be able through purchase of substrate from other producers, get into different grades and to keep going grades for the other market for instance. There were meaningful operational benefits. It gives us great sort of flexibility and optionality as we integrated with couple of flat roll facility. And it will give us a substantial pull through volume. Our intent is to be drawing about 300,000 tons thereabouts from Butler into the facility. And processing the remaining substrate from others and that will actually gives us sort of leverage on our steel facility we\u2019re going to be fine when you consider New Millennium side of business and attacks where we\u2019ll find somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million tons of substrate there. I don\u2019t think you can overlook the exact pull through volume. The through-cycle earnings generation will be a huge kind for us. Chris Terry : Just one other one on Heartland, seems to have plans to double the galvanizing capacity for about 80 million. Given your Columbus galvanizing line, where is that fit or do you still have plans down the track or is that something you\u2019ll just evaluate with time? Mark Millett : As Theresa suggested we only closed on June 29, the day after my birthday incidentally. But again we\u2019re still absorbing a solid integration of that facility. I think we look at Heartland as certainly being a growth platform either downstream or back to the hot side or both with time. Chris Terry : And then just a final one just on the capital management, you got about 50 million less to the 450 million buyback program, any more guidance on capital allocation or how are you looking at M&A and just the use of cash flow at this point? Theresa Wagler : While as it relates to buyback program Chris, it's really been a valuable tool for us and so as we get to the point where we extinguish the remainder of that program, we\u2019ll take a look at where we stand on both from a transactional perspective and organic perspective and add that back to the toolbox if it makes sense to utilize that and so we\u2019ll be addressing our consignment surely in the coming third quarter. Mark Millett : I think obviously we\u2019re blessed with an incredibly strong balance sheet and our through-cycle cash generation profile I think will remain incredibly strong. It allows us kind of having a very balanced cash allocation approach. So we will review that at the end of that program. We obviously will continue to evaluate our dividend profile against the through cycle cash generation and would hope that we\u2019ll continue the positive profile that we demonstrated in the past then to return some value to the shareholder. We're still squarely focused on growth both organically I think we outlined a lot of the opportunities that are in progress today and will give us significant value going forward. And the team has demonstrated for the last 25 years and we\u2019ll continue to demonstrate our ability to sweep a lot more ahead of the existing assets. But then also from a transactional side its quite plus it\u2019s just a crazy world but the pipeline is full. There are more opportunities and probably we can handle currently, so it\u2019s a good issue to have. And I think those opportunities have significant potential strategic fit and also the significant size opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Korn : Congratulations on the several records over the quarter. I saw a really strong pop and long products in the Structural and Rail and Mark you talked about a little bit. But are you ahead of schedule with some of those capacity utilization issues there? I would like to apply similar questions over an Engineered Bar Roanoke given the volume performance. What I am getting at is, are those sustainable totals plus or minus in seasonality provided the underlying markets continues as they are? Mark Millett : I believe so, you certainly have increased market demand. You had year-over-year I think structural imports were down 20%, 22% or thereabouts recognizing a lot of that is rebar which obviously plays well into our strategy to get into that marketplace. The team though has done I think a magnificent job diversifying the product mix, getting into new market niche opportunities. If you look at - I know it\u2019s small but the galvanizing line is installed at steel West Virginia. I think it's maxed - its wide open and it gives that mill sort of diversification and the ability to run at high rates even in this market today. I do believe it\u2019s sustainable. Those environments continue to grow from a demand perspective. We\u2019re seeing huge growth at the SBQ mill in Pittsboro. As a reminder, we installed additional capability back three years five years from that. Yes, but it never had a steel consuming market to really exploit or leverage that additional capacity. And the team is literally out there and is gaining market share and doing a great job. So I think long products is in great shape. It continue to grow and additional not only volumes are increasing but if look at the spreads in long products particularly structural for the last three or four years it\u2019s been a year-over-year contraction, that\u2019s reversed it\u2019s a positive market environment. The spreads are expanding so we\u2019ll get in the advantage of both volume and spread. Theresa Wagler : And I think it\u2019s important to add to that you mentioned the project. The project actually aren\u2019t ahead of schedule and the ones that we're expecting to be initiated including the rebar project at Roanoke has started. But the one real significant project which help increase the volume at the structural and rail division even more is the additional rebar project which we\u2019ve talked about not coming online and beginning of 2019. And so you still have a volume impact that's coming as well, not just market related but actual volume and diversification. Matthew Korn : So this is really a matter of capacity utilization as opposed to anything added to the denominator? Theresa Wagler : At this point, yes. Matthew Korn : So let me flip that over \u2013 it's very helpful, thank you. Let me put this over in the flat side because we\u2019ve seen spreads over hot-rolled coil for value added flats compressive substantially in recent months as hot-rolled coil availability is tightened. And Mark you pointed out the cyclicality there. So what\u2019s your assumption for a long-term price differential among the value added cheap products there. Whether those the ones you are embedding in your Heartland numbers or when you\u2019re doing your projected return for is the new gal line. What\u2019s there do you think through cycle. Theresa Wagler : So we\u2019ll get into the details but what I will tell you is that we\u2019re not using the records first as we seen in the last call it 2016, 2017, 2018 we\u2019re using a longer term average for that spread. Matthew Korn : Got it. I appreciate it. Mark Millett : But from a market perspective I think we suggested several calls when the spreads between hot-rolled cold and coated and coated sheet went up to 200 I think - 220 that we felt that it was a case of hot rolled coil lagging. It wasn\u2019t the case of coated being excessive. Obviously with the trade constraints, important constraints hot rolled coil is come up to the coated and surpassed really the historical levels. We would imagine that over time with again with some control in imports that historical spread would be restored. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : I just want to follow up on the discussion of the new galvanizing capacity, cold rolling capacity, that you're adding that others have been adding, also that OCTG restrictions and even some of the dumping cases irrespective of Section 232 are kind of tightening the hot roll market. What you think it takes for you to decide to add any flat roll capacity and what kind of conditions would you need to see for that investment decision? Mark Millett : I think obviously, you're right, Timna. The market is very positive, such huge momentum. Hot roll coil sector is very tight and will continue to be for some time and I believe that you're going to have some new hot roll capacity coming out little bit of this mingle junction capacities are going to bring some more capacity on, but that's going to be more than absorbed by this continued growth in demand and the notion of imports. I think from the standpoint of greenfield investment, our preference obviously is to grow through existing capacity and not add capacity to the marketplace, first and foremost. That being said, I think it's only prudent for us as we evaluate opportunities, transact more opportunities. We do so out of diligence, calibrate that against greenfield and the respectful return that one may get from that. Timna Tanners : I wanted to separately ask a little bit about cost pressures, and although obviously a really strong quarter, just curious about what was embedded in that just for go-forward regarding specific cost pressures? I think from electrodes, freight and labor would be maybe the key incremental cost, if you don't mind, can you tell me little bit more what you saw there? Theresa Wagler : Timna, with respect to electrodes, I think we mentioned on the last quarter's call that we expected electrodes to be up in the second quarter, an additional $4 per ton, and that would be I think a good range to assume. On the labor, a reminder is that we're very much variable as the Company extends compensation. And so labor impact on a percentage increase basis and isn't anything that it really as no at this point in time. And as always to freight, a lot of our freight is a pass-through and actually the freight on a per ton basis I can't tell you if it's meaningfully higher or not, I don't know if Barry, Glenn, or Chris, may have a different perspective? Mark Millett : Well, we're definitely seeing higher freight cost that are dashing through the system. It's in the view related to various quarter as we ship but is definitely pressure across the industry to move things back and forth. We're seeing all the way from scrap to finished good shipments. This point is concerning but it's manageable to supply. Glenn Pushis : And really the freight impact versus only on the raw material input size, the consuming base takes up the train on the cold shipping. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Just looking at your fabrication business, obviously your business came under good margin pressure in the course of Q2 given the rise in input costs. Could you just comment on the outlook for continued strong demand in order intake? How long should it take for you to be able to better pass on these raw materials costs to customers and where margins recover? And then on top that, if you can talk a little about the order backlog, how has that progressed over recent months, and are you seeing an acceleration or deceleration of demand trends going into H2? Thank you. Chris Graham : Yes, we do see that we are - the team is making strides against raw material increases. We are closing the gap, the width to your point with that. Unable to garner everything that we've been exposed to, particularly since November to January time period where prices went up literally $200 a ton, and some of our products we make with both merchant and flat roll and some of the merchant and flat roll relationships had swung on that magnitude of $350 a ton over the last 6 months. But the team is - we do have evidence that the team is able to get some pricing. We expect that if we get out of our facility of the first half of the year on steel pricing, we see any kind of settling, 3 to 6 months we were able to start recruiting that, the demand is such that we do believe we'll be able to get the kind of pricing we need to eventually catch up and it still weighs out for us. Theresa, is that first statement? Theresa Wagler : Yes, no, it's very well said. We've got increased pricing even in the second quarter on adjacent backside. We don't expect demand to support backfilling into third quarter as well. So much of it, if you remember Seth they have 8 to 12 weeks from the time they close to the time they ship. That takes some time, so I would expect some of the compression in the third quarter as well. Mark Millett : As far as demands at, we continue to see elevated levels of quarter activities that support further growth. Warehouse and industrial sectors remain in a big growth mode and make up the lion's share of the industry shipments these days. Resale construction continues to lag the other sectors with the exception of the discount retailer and dollar stores, they're still in a good growth mode. Again, quarter activity remains robust. The industry is off pace to talk about that, the industry is on pace to book around 1.2 million tons this year in the joint industry. That would represent the highest annual bookings since 2008. So, I think the team is positioned well there executing in a fairly tough environment from a cost standpoint and as they make headway against that, we'll see continued improved results. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Cleveland Rueckert with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Cleveland Rueckert : I just wanted to follow up on the long volumes as mentioned they were very sharply quarter, that roughly is 30% year-over-year increase. Do you have those bridge how much came from the end market growth, how much M&A and then how much from market share gain? Theresa Wagler : So, from a long side perspective, we didn't have year-over-year, we haven't had any significant M&A. All we did was add maybe 80,000 tons of capability annual rate on the finishing side of SBQ. We didn't see really anything from a transactional perspective. From the perspective of organic growth project, again, as I mentioned them, the rebar project, we all know is actually just getting started now. So that year-over-year change also is not really related to any organic type of expansion. It really is mostly market driven and from the perspective of whether that share or not, one can jump in, I would suggest that. There is market share gains on the beam side and on the SBQ side. I'm not sure about any other specific pull out. Chris Graham : Of all those including Rails were strong this year also. So, we're getting more Rail trades per month off of roll mine. So, also Structural SBQ and Rail have been stronger this year and showing some market demand. Theresa Wagler : So, we're feeling pretty optimistic, how we make the second half of the year related to construction demands both from the perspective of what we're seeing on the long product side as well as Chris's commentary on fabrication. Cleveland Rueckert : I guess and just maybe to clarify, you did mention that structural imports are down by 20% to 22%. So, do you have any idea how much the market is up versus the share gains you're achieving from lower imports? Mark Millett : Just for clarity, the 22% year-over-year down is not just structural, it's long product, its general. Theresa Wagler : Most of that is rebar. Mark Millett : Most of that is rebar, yes. Cleveland Rueckert : I guess my question is, how much is the end market growth versus how much are you taking share of import? Theresa Wagler : Cleave, I\u2019m not sure that we're able to answer that question specifically right at the moment, but it's our gut and we know lot of the momentum is really happening within the end markets itself, although imports have obviously been impactful. Barry Schneider : And the confusion there really is mostly in fabricated steel versus what's coming in from structural. Structural, we see coming out of the country is down but we're looking at the fabricated structural is increasing or steady last year is slightly increasing. So it\u2019s hard to get a handle on both those props. Cleveland Rueckert : Have confidence that the end market is growing which has been like you\u2019re getting a double benefit. Mark Millett : Yes absolutely and it\u2019s been growing for the last few years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Piyush Sood : Just a quick one from me. There were major reports that you\u2019d agree to acquire Kentucky Electric Steel. Just wanted to check if they are accurate and if so better understand the rationality opportunity and the timeline for the restart over there? Mark Millett : I would put it in the classification of plan, acquisition right now we haven\u2019t closed on it although it\u2019s looking favorable. It\u2019s not a mass entity relative to - more global scope. We will have a 200,000 tons of rolling capability principally flat and the flat bars that so it gives us some solid diversification. Our intent is not currently to start-up the half side it just to better utilize our steel West Virginia and our Roanoke billet capacity. So the good thing its one of the improved - again improve the through-cycle utilization and earnings profile of those two facilities down there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Gambardella : Just want to ask you a theoretical question. If you would give us a rough ballpark answer to this one. If you look at the current today\u2019s spot steel prices and scrap prices and there were no lags and they were fully realized in the second quarter results how much higher is your profits have been in the second quarter? Theresa Wagler : Well they would have been meaningfully higher and the reason that would be is because if you look at the spot differential it had currently it would be higher than our average unless specific they are flat roll they had nothing to do long product. So it would be higher than the average and we have 6% of our book today at Butler and Columbus we\u2019re basically hired the contract. And so that lagging in every two or three months. And that will have an impacted the second quarter regardless of volume and mix and so you\u2019ll see some of what would be current force, so we have been made you into light spot spreads hitting the third quarter this year as we move forward 50% of that. So there is an impact but I can what will I guess I should say quantify that. Michael Gambardella : And then second question, you're expanding into rebar presence particularly in the Midwest and Mid Atlantic before the tariffs went into effect I believe Turkey had about 12% market share in the U.S. rebar business. And what are you seeing from Turkey now that the tariffs are in existence? Mark Millett : It\u2019s a marginal or negligible I would suggest. So it\u2019s quite timely that we\u2019re bringing the Roanoke facility on. I wish Columbus city will be come along tomorrow as well but that\u2019s not the case. Michael Gambardella : So were most of the Turkish imports penetrating on the Mid-Atlantic and spreading out to the Midwest or where do you see a lot of the presence in the Turkish? Mark Millett : You\u2019re exactly right, Mid Atlantic is going two points higher than the Midwest. Chris Graham : If we haven\u2019t been in the rebar market in the sort of solid Midwest to really get a feel, our small amount of rebar production has been at Roanoke and that\u2019s Mid Atlantic and that\u2019s where we've seen the pressure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Phil Gibbs : Theresa do you have the sheet mix for the quarter handy? Theresa Wagler : I do Phil, I am sorry, I made you ask. I didn\u2019t flip that page. Hot rolled and P&O for the second quarter the shipments were 915,000 tons for cold roll and it was 135,000 tons and for coated it was 774,000 tons. Phil Gibbs : And any signs so just we can understand where the paint line ramp is within that coated mix how much of that was paint any color you all can provide there? Theresa Wagler : Yes, so the Indiana lines have been running pretty full and that\u2019s not the differential but I think we are speaking about is the ramp at the Columbus paint line and it\u2019s actually ramped up quite well. So shipments in the second quarter were around 90% to 95% of their shipping capacity on painted. Phil Gibbs : So you all are pretty much at your painted capacity at this point? Theresa Wagler : For the second quarter yes. Phil Gibbs : And just second question from me is just on SBQ. Certainly very strong quarter-over-quarter growth in volume. Just trying to understand how much of that is called as finished hot rolled bar versus billet trying to see most billet substrates just trying to understand how much greater participation the domestics you might be having in that supply chain right now given all the trade for dynamics and the strength in the energy markets? Mark Millett : Clearly the billets - because this one portion is billets have been stable through the year so that where we didn\u2019t grow much. Our growth is in the smaller diameter bars and the cold finished market and hence our expansion into our all finishing facility and we\u2019re penetrating automotive with some of the smaller sizes and the billets. The supply of that are coming from Columbia City plant, which helped the utilization of the mills out there. Phil Gibbs : Glenn are you seeing generally increased market penetration for SBQ within automotive in general not just the production rates but is there more content growth over time? Glenn Pushis : Yes, that\u2019s what we are seeing. Automotive appears to be strong again next year with 17 million bill rate being projected. Class A trucks are heavy, heavy, heavy right now wide open. So we\u2019re penetrating those markets very successfully. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please proceed with your question. John Tumazos : As you increased the volume, will you continue to source the steel from third-party mills or from your own mills. I guess there is wild demand for steel and as a core we\u2019re at, would Heartland be a base load for another steel dynamics flat rolled mill. One company is talking about Brownfield Texas and another one about gas strip on the West Coast. Or is it just for two addition convenient the Granite City is reopening to blast furnaces and the old wheeling Pittsburgh, Steubenville has 40,000 tons of scrap already to go? Mark Millett : Well the substrate supply John to Heartland from Butler and it principally be for Butler is planned to be somewhere around 300,000 tons. That will expand and contract depending on strength of the market and elsewhere. So we will be continuing relationships with third-parties. As I said earlier we\u2019re already buying early in 1.2 million, 1.3 million tons so that would take our procurement up to almost 2 million tons. So that\u2019s not something new for us and hopefully will give us a little bit of leverage in the marketplace but we\u2019ll still continue to maintain those good relationships we\u2019ve had. Relative to hot production again as I said Heartland in our mind provides a growth opportunity whether that will be downstream or upstream and there is ability to install hot capacity there if we deem that to be a good investment. John Tumazos : If I could ask a follow-up, was the 2 million tons of purchases would that make you something like the 8th largest steel buyer in the United States? Mark Millett : I don\u2019t know where it puts us but it\u2019s a significant player on the procurement side yes. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing comments. Mark Millett : Well again would like to thank you for your time and your support of our company. I think our future is incredibly rosy. It\u2019s good to be in the steel business today as even better to be in the steel business as STI. I think the demand profile the market profile and momentum is going to continue through the rest of this year into 2019 and I think we\u2019re going to have fun. So thank you all. So our employees, thanks for all you do. And remember be safe each and every day. Thank you all. Bye, bye. Theresa Wagler : Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

Our underlying growth to market positioning during the last four to five years is showing its power and the strong demand environment. I think the terms are perspective that SDI is a very different Company today relative to the last market peak. And I\u2019d like to take a moment to specifically thank the leadership here today and along with the respected teams for an absolutely extraordinary job. Not just their execution this past quarter, but over the last several years as we intentionally position the Company for the long-term prosperity and superior shareholder return. Our growth expanded product diversification and market positioning will continue to achieve higher highs and shift us infirmly higher loads driving a considerably higher through cycle cash flow generation capability. So team hats-off to you, you are the best team on the planet.  But to begin this morning, Theresa would you provide some clarity into our financial results. Theresa Wagler : Yes. Obviously. Good morning everyone and thanks everybody here today. Our third quarter 2018 net income was a record $398 million or $1.69 per diluted share which includes fair value purchase accounting adjustments of approximately $30 million or $0.04 per diluted share associated with the recent Heartland acquisition and all of those additional charges are actually in our cost of goods sold line in the income statement and it also included a discrete tax benefit of $10 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to a change in tax accounting methodology which is a onetime pick up. Excluding these two items, our adjusted results remain unchanged at $1.69 per share and we are above our guidance of $1.64 to a $1.68 as steel results came in above expectations. For the third consecutive quarter, we have achieved the record revenue to $3.2 billion in the third quarter higher sales reflected improved average realized product pricing across the steel platform. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $532 million and adjusted EBITDA of $626 million, a continued tremendous performance by average loan with our steel operations leading the improvement. As a reminder, we acquired Heartland, a Flat Roll steel processing company on June 29th of this year. Therefore this quarter represents the first impact from an earnings perspective. Integration is going well and the teams are executing. The plan remains to maximize galvanized steel sales of approximately 360,000 tons while building cold rolls and P&O sales during the next six to nine months to reaching average annualize total run-rate of around 800,000 tons by midyear 2019. On our last call, we noted that we believe that through cycle EBITDA estimate for Heartland is between $50 million and $60 million per year run-rate. Given the geographic location and optionality of production in Heartland brings to our Midwest flat roll group, we believe there are also additional benefits to be derived. Our early estimates for those group synergies are in the range of $10 million to $15 million per year at run-rate. Regarding our steel results for the third quarter 2018, steel shipments improved slightly to a record 2.8 million tons. For the third consecutive quarter, steel metal price expanded meaningfully across the platform as our average quarter realized sales price increased $56 per ton and $988 in the third quarter and our average scrap cost consumed only increased $4 per ton to $352. The result was record operating income of $577 million or 7% sequential improvement for steel. For our metals recycling platform third quarter operating income was $18 million an $8 million decline from last quarter. Nonferrous shipments and metals spreads were negatively impacted from declining nonferrous commodity prices as well as the actions from China to ban certain recycled material imports through their Green Sword policy. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model which benefits both the steel mills and the scrap operations. The metals recycling group shipped 65% of their ferrous scrap to our own steel mills, increasing scrap quality, mill efficiency and reducing companywide working capital requirement. Exceeding record high shipments in the third quarter, our fabrication operations continued to see strong demand in customer optimism moving into 2019. Other activity has been strong and our fabrication backlog was a near record high moving into October. However all these steel input costs continue to rise and outpaced improved selling values, resulting in a slight decline in third quarter earnings. Operating income from our steel fabrication platform was $13 million in the quarter. During the third quarter of 2018 we generated record cash flow from operations of $420 million. Operational networking capital grew 53 million in the third quarter due to the overall market improvement which resulted in higher customer account balances and inventory value. So far this year we have generated cash flow from operations of $924 million and now they are record results. Year-to-date capital investment was $176 million. We currently estimate fourth quarter capital expenditures to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million. An early estimate for 2019 capital investment is approximately $350 million, we may update that or generally we will update that or in the fourth quarter conference call, but right now I'm looking at sustaining capital which includes environmental and safety initiatives of about $150 million for next year. We have some spending on the Columbus's nonsmoker to reserve galvanizing line that is about $100 million spend next year and then the remaining $100 million will be other expansionary and efficiency growth process. Regarding shareholder distributions, after our 20% increase in fourth quarter of this year, we maintained our cash dividend at 0.1875 per common share and we also repurchased a 193 million of our common stock during the first nine months of 2018. Completing our $450 million program authorized in October of 2016 and initiating a new $750 million program in August. Our liquidity increased to $2.2 billion at September 30, representing $999 million in cash in short-term investments and $1.2 billion of available funding under our revolving credit facilities. The strength of our recycle cash generation coupled with a strong credit and capital structure profile provides meaningful opportunities for continued growth and continued shareholder distributions through our positive dividend profile and our share repurchase program. We have squarely positioned from the continuation of sustainable optimized value creation. And finally for those that requests more detail concerning our flat roll shipment, we had hot rolls and pickle and oil shipments of 901,000 tons in the quarter. We had closed roll shipments of 138,000 tons and coded shipments of 819,000 tons. And then I would also note that in our sacramental financial data, this quarter given the increase in the amount of, what I will call process tons with the addition of Heartland, we actually broke up Flat Roll shipment so that you can see Heartland in the effect combine. And then you can see Butler and Columbus combine. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thanks Theresa. Well safety is an all and is will be number one priority unfortunately we have reversed the updates in recordable incidence we experienced in the second quarter, but unfortunately year-to-date I will recall instant rate still lagging last year\u2019s result. But I think commendably our loss time rates still continues its year-over-year downward trend and is significantly better than industry average. Nothing surpass the influence of creating and maintaining a safe and work environment and while performance remains significantly better than the industry averages, it\u2019s certainly not enough, we must continually be aware of our environment and of those around us. I challenge all of us to be focus and to keep moving towards our ultimate goal of zero incidence. The Steel platform continues to perform exceedingly well, we achieved record quarterly steel earnings and continue to reach numerous production milestones. The addition of Heartland this quarter, we also have record high steel shipments as the volume offset lower shipments from our Butler Flat Roll division. Underlying demand remains strong, the customers took a temporary purchasing hiatus in anticipation of lower transaction prices as scrap pricing dipped a little and imports moderated some. It is important to remember domestic steel inventory levels appeared to be balanced and virtually every domestic steel consuming sector is already in good shape or continues to improve. We believe domestic steel consumption as the reason for growth in 2019. We continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future to new investment and our existing operations. In June, we announced a new $140 million galvanizing line at our Columbus Flat Roll division. This investment is yet another step of further diversification into higher margin products. The 400,000 ton line is expected to begin operating midyear 2020. In recent years, Columbus has transformed it\u2019s product offering through the addition of painting and galvalume coating capability and through the introduction of more complex grades of Flat Roll steel some of which serve the automotive sector. The diversion of product to these value added outlets has reduced the amount of volume available to our existing galvanized customer base. So the addition of a the third galvanizing facility will allow Columbus to serve these existing customers along with new customers in the region. This expansion will also reduce Columbus\u2019 exposure to a more cyclical Heartland market which will results in a higher and less volatile through cycle earnings. Additionally, during the next two years, we plan to make additional investments at Columbus to upgrade certain processing lines in hot strip mode capability to further enhance and stabilize profitability to further product diversification and process efficiency gains. The investments will increase Columbus\u2019 range of complex grade capabilities and will improve the process control needed to reduce advanced high strength steel grades used in the automotive industry and also in the energy market. These investments extend Columbus\u2019 strategy to diversify into downstream value added capability. We also investing in our long product steel operations, this projects coupled with the improvement construction and industrial markets have already resulted in increased capacity utilization. As an example, we have two primary organic initiatives to increase the utilization of our structural and rail division which operated at 75% of its capacity in 2017, and in contrast is been operating in over 90% of its capacity this year. First we've grown the production of SBQ quality blooms for internal supply to our engineered bar division. They need blooms to fully utilize their rolling capability. This improves through cycle utilization at both facilities. Those of 27,000 tons of blooms shipped in the third quarter, we are achieving our anticipated annual run rate of transferring over 200,000 tons from Columbus to Pittsboro. Second we are investing over $80 million utilize excess melting and casting capability at the structural rail division through expansion and product diversification for the addition of an annual production capability of 240,000 tons of rebar including spooled, custom cut to length and smooth bar. Our unique rebar supply chain model is expected to substantially enhance customer optionality and flexibility, providing meaningful logistic yield and working capital benefits. In addition, we will be the largest independent rebar supplier in the mid rest fleet. We strongly believe that these innovative, cost-effective products can provide a material improvement in future through cycle utilization and profitability at this facility. The expansion also compliments the recent growth at our Roanoke Bar Division, we invested approximately $38 million to also utilize the excess melting and casting capability. Planning for about 200,000 tons of rebar volume manually, we started operations a few months ago and commission is ongoing. I think the steel seems to stand pro and with the addition of the Heartland acquisition, we now have almost 12.5 million tons of annual shipping capability. Historically Heartland was operated at low utilization rates and they focused on galvanized steel. We plan to focus on a full breath of products including very light gauge sheet and our operating expertise, product market familiarity and the geographic proximity of our existing less flat roll operations allows for meaningful value creation. Consistent with our strategy to differentiate and grow through product diversification, Heartland provides wider and lighter gauge product capability. We are familiar with their market and customer base. Due to the continued addition of value added capabilities at our Butler\u2019s Flat Roll division, we have displaced some of our customers that manages steel by Heartland. Heartland will also provide pull-through volume, we plan to supply at least 300,000 tons of steel substrate from above the flat roll division, thereby increasing through cycle profitability at both locations. Holland should also improved Butler's cold mill productivity. We plan to reduce lighter gauge flat roll load at Heartland which should increased Butlers Cold Mill productivity. Lighter gauge products require more time to run, so to speak and Heartland is better equipped to make these gauges. We believe the Heartland acquisition will result in numerous future running synergies both the Heartland\u2019s current operations and to our broader Midwest flat roll group. As Theresa explained, we believe annual synergies to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Heartland provides the unique margin enhancing opportunities for Steel Dynamics and we are excited to continue the integration and realize the value creation. While metals recycling earnings decreased sequentially the platform delivered a solid performance on a complicated freight environment. Non ferrous shipments and metal spread decreased due to declining commodity prices and the changing export market environment, given China's recent ban on certain recycle materials. Also the ferrous scraps picked up a little more than expected last month and the market recovered some of the drop manifest in August and September. We expect seasonal pattern to keep the market firm through the rest of the year. Long-term, we are committed to the premise that scrap supply will outgrow anticipated demand, even the expectations of higher steel mill utilization rates and associated scrap needs. The steel fabrication team achieved record shipments in the quarter and I would like to congratulate them for an incredible job. Our order backlog remains strong. Similarly, our customer backlogs are extremely strong with someone having to turn business away. The ongoing strengths of the business and customer optimism is a solid indicator that nonresidential sector strength will continue well into next year. Based on strong underlying domestic steel demand fundamentals and customer optimisms throughout all market sectors we believe steel consumption will continue to be seasonally strong and grow into 2019. In combination with our expansion initiatives, we believe there are firm drivers for our continued growth. Furthermore, the actions the U.S. Federal Government has recently made to develop a healthy domestic steel industry should provide sustainable long-term support for the U.S. manufacturing base and continued erode import running. We also believe that USMCA negotiations will result in a constructive outcome for our industry. Specific to Steel Dynamics our unique culture and execution of the long-term strategy continues to strengthen our competitive position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, and it clearly demonstrates our sustainability and differentiates us from our competition. Customer focus coupled with market diversification and low cost operating platforms support our ability to maintain our best in class performance and differentiation. The Company and the team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth. Our team provides the foundation for our success and I thank each and every one of them for their hard work and commitment to excellence in all they do and remind them safety is the first priority. We are committed to providing exemplary long-term values to our employees to our communities, customers and shareholders as alike and look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us in the years ahead. So once again, thank you for your time and interest in our Company, and Terry we would like to open the call up for questions now. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Korn : Hi good morning everyone, thanks for taking my questions. So I had a couple of questions. One is short-term, the other one is long-term. First, you have highlighted this temporary backing off of orders that you saw on your buyers as the imports of hot-rolled coil goes. I want to ask was this hesitancy in orders was that really centric to hot-rolled coil? Or did you see any similar behavior across the longs? And then second as its normalized since then are you seeing it tick backup or would you expect with the season and as you are seeing prices to somewhat stabilize here in the mid 800 or so? Thanks. Mark Millett : I think certainly the hiatus was reversed itself in the last couple of weeks and we have seen on the flat rolled side very, very strong order intake and I think on the long product side, it wasn\u2019t quite as pronounced. I think the order rate just continued at a recently strong pace through that period. Matthew Korn : Okay. So really focused in that particular product. Let me ask a longer-term one, a little bit in more demotic, there has been a lot of announced steel expansion projects year-to-date, your own, your established competitors, new entrants. So even if you handicap the normal discount that is been announced versus what gets executed, it seems like a lot of metal coming in, especially we are going to keep aiming for this 80% capacity utilization. Does this concern you, but do you feel comfortable that all this new supply could be absorbed out much disruption and if so why? Mark Millett : Well, I think the, firstly the market remains incredibly strong as I said in every market sector and we continue to see and believe strongly that that is going to into 2019 and so demand will be strong and increase - maybe incremental, but it will continue to increase. At the same time, imports are going to dissipate, I think the actions that the government owners have made are starting to take place with the slight refraction in market pricing of the highest we sold a couple of months ago, all the thrash import pricing is dissipated to some degree. And I think imports are going to erode further and if you look at the imports return to just a regular normal historical rate. I think this kind of demand to the absorb increased supply. Theresa Wagler : And the only other things I would add Matthew is that if you look at the Greenfield capacity expansions that have potentially been announced, those wouldn\u2019t come into market for probably two to three years earlier. So, there is that part of the equation as well. Matthew Korn : Got it. So, between timing import reduction and continued strengthen demand you feel pretty confident. Mark Millett : Yes. Matthew Korn : Thanks very much folks, good luck. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Terry : Hi Mark and team. I just had a question on the fabrication margins, based on the order of backlogs, do you think that margins have broadened and should we see recovery going forward or is it still a couple of point is that given the seasonality. Chris Graham : I think you made a good point. This is Chris, we think that seasonality will higher match a little bit, but we do think that we will continue to - we will begin to start seeing spread. Chris Terry : Okay. Okay. Thanks. And just maybe one for Mark on the M&A top line. Is it changed at all over the last few months? Are you still looking for sort of smaller scale? And how you think about the size and the opportunities that it seems since we had to recall last time? Mark Millet : My preference is still enough small scale, as you appreciate and we certainly appreciate, it seems to take just much time and effort and distraction of small deals and there is a big deal. But we certainly have a pipeline that is still very accurate and active across the breadth of scales and I think perhaps on the downstream pull through volume type opportunities. They are smaller-scale but the purchase we made some time ago, but there are other larger opportunities as well. We remain I would say disciplined obviously given the market before the valuations are pretty strong and we're working through those issues in sort of negotiations to discussions. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Gagliano : I\u2019m just going to ask just one near-term. Based on your visibility of the order books what is a reasonable range of assumptions for changes in your operations volumes quarter-over-quarter and in the fourth quarter my first question. Theresa Wagler : As you know Dave, based on seasonality and the holiday and the customers base looking to realign inventories at the end of the year, this deal shipments are always lower in the fourth quarter and that goes back to as long as I have been doing this for last 20 years. So that would be our expectations as well, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been [indiscernible] anything that is unique to this market environment, it\u2019s just normal seasonality. David Gagliano : Okay that is helpful. And then just on strategic question, just kind of in generic terms. When you prove the landscape of acquisition opportunities that you are seeing out there right now. How does the valuation that you see compared to the other options in terms of for example getting even more aggressive on buying back more of your own stock that kind of thing. Mark Millet : I think I guess just on a broader prospective, this is all cash allocations strategy in general. Obviously we evaluate I wouldn\u2019t say daily, but frequently the best use for our cash and we have always I think at least in the past use you are seeing use all the tools in our tool box there. We have the financial strength and basis to be able to not have to directed to one or another. So I believe the positive dividend stream profile will continue as our through cycling cash generation profile continues to increase as well. You are seeing the initial share repurchase program and we have got another in place the $750 million. And I think we believe prudently even more strongly today that our shares are - our market cap is undervalued and there is great value there. So I think you will as aggressively peruse that program. As we continue to evaluate further organic growth and transactional opportunities. So I think we look at all those mechanisms, there we believe opportunities for good value on transactional side yet and certainly obviously our organic and internal projects are absolutely the best place to spend on them. David Gagliano : Okay. That is helpful, that sounds somewhat of our previous comments. But what I\u2019m kind of trying to get to is right now in the current market place, you are stock where it is, opportunities out there right now, what do you think are better opportunity for you? Is it buying back the stock? Or is it - are there good size of all acquisition opportunities available? Mark Millet : I think there is the opportunity to do both. Theresa Wagler : If you look the profile that we have and I mean you know [indiscernible] if you look at the cash and the balance sheet and the generation pace that we are adding in, we definitely have the capability to both maximize the repurchase program as well as look at the deals that we are looking at and it wouldn\u2019t jeopardize our credit profile nor our ability grow, hopefully in the next downturn as well which is always something that we like to do is find great value in doing that. David Gagliano : Okay. Thanks very much. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Curt Woodworth : Thanks. Good morning Mark, Theresa. Two questions. The first is just looking at your cost structure in the third quarter it seems like conversion costs increased pretty significantly year-on-year. I know there is a lot of sort of moving pieces within that between variable labor, power maintenance, maybe some Heartland inventory impact. But can you just comment on that because it looks like it was close to $500 million annualized this quarter versus last quarter in the mill segment? Theresa Wagler : Curt, I'll take that, I saw your note last night, so I want to give more comment on based you are asking the questions. Actually if you look I'm going to address quarter-over-quarter before year-over-year, but if you look quarter-over-quarter our conversion costs are actually lower if you backed out number I particularly mentioned that $13 million is going to the cost and goods sold lines at Heartland, but more impact fully is the fact that now if you look at Heartland in the tax and its reason we are breaking out their volume they make up about 11% of our total steel shipments and you have to look at conversion on total steel shipments or you missed the cost impression, you can't look at it based on external. So because it\u2019s now at about 11% of our volume versus we know it\u2019s just a tax it was somewhere between call it 5% to 7%, there is a bigger impact because you can't get as much. There is a higher conversion cost that it looks like it\u2019s having because we are buying our substrate outside of this company and so that steel cost input is getting mixed up. If you just look at straight conversion cost to steel operations in the sequential quarters they actually decreased. If you look at it year-over-year there has been an increase but not as sizable as you have mentioned. The increase is closer to $10 to $15 and that is really if you elect those refractory our operations they are in still performance stage from an incentive perspective, there is higher bonuses as well because the possibility is higher. So there is nothing that is significant for us to point out on and I'm happy to walk you through it later as well. Curt Woodworth : Okay. So that reported figure this quarter that is a reasonable baseline to use going forward then? Theresa Wagler : As we look at your model, I would encourage you to try to separate the tax in the Heartland volume from the other steel mill volume and there is going to be an impact. So as you look at it the only thing I would tell you is you do need to change as your denominator, it's going to be an actual shipment, there will need to be total shipments. Curt Woodworth : Yes, we are running it off total shipments. So, we can catch up online. I don\u2019t know if the arithmetic would necessarily change, but that is fine. Okay. Second question is just around maybe for you Mark just kind of communication with commerce or sort of trade -- people you speak to in Washington. Do you feel that there is that article in AMM about -- I think, the AISI presidents have potential resolution of Canada in November on tariffs. Do you have sense of sort of what that negotiation looks like, has the steel management has kind of communicated what they would like to see happen with respect to Canada? Mark Millet : Well, I think the negotiations are playing out recently well for us generally in the steel industry. Again I\u2019m very glad that the administration has been able to find common brand with kind of the Mexico this game, as a block we need to be working together and another game goes out. But, trade in general the silly program I think is worth and incredibly well is created a much level of playing field and has given release to the industry and is going to support, I think pricing in the market into next year. And I think as I said earlier imports generally are going to continue to roll I believe. Relative to Mexico and to the Canada and the so forth USMCA I guess we're going to be going in the future [indiscernible] nonetheless. It\u2019s a going to be benefit to us primarily it\u2019s a sales of auto and auto parts which now will have a minimum content requirement and minimum wage component fair range, more U.S. thought production and more North American steel inputs. And we have seen actually just recently since the announce of research and order in clarity from Mexico there was a lot of uncertainty there for a while when no one knew exactly what was going to pan out. But as clarity has come to the forefront, again our customer base in Mexico is strong. But generally I think no one knows and one can only speculate as for the final details, but prudence will rule the day and its going to be a benefit for us. Curt Woodworth : Great. Really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : Hi. Good morning guys. Mark Millett : Good morning. Theresa Wagler : Good morning. Timna Tanners : I was wondering if you could talk us through Q4 pricing your current market conditions, just because it\u2019s always helpful to get a reminder about how much of your business operates on a CRU kind of lag and how much would be expose to the spot price. And I know you are not the spot rolled, but if you could just remind us like what percentages would be expose to spot and what percentages might see a lag and help us think about again to considering current conditions? Theresa Wagler : Timna, the only real significant contract business that we have to-date within the Flat Roll and generally about 50% of it is contractual where you are going to get a lag, that is based on the CRU index and that lag generally is probably about two months. And so you are going to have 50% that will be subject to spot and the other 50% subject to that contract. On the loan product side, generally there is no contractual business, there is a very small amount in the SBQ side of the business, but not enough for you to try to model. Timna Tanners : Okay. I appreciate that. And then I was wondering separately if you could talk about the rebar expansion and the Columbus plant in a little bit more detail. So Columbus is already really strong asset, really strong profitability and so I\u2019m curious like what further if you could detail a little further what you can do to enhance that, is it more product, it is cost or both. And now on the rebar side, your new entrance into that market somewhat right, I know you doubled than in the past I believe, but how are there customers receiving your product, how are you finding that market acceptance so far. Thanks. Mark Millett : Timna on the Columbus plant, bringing the new galvanize line allows us to make galvanize products for general consumption. So as we grow our automotive business from that plant as well as our paid business, it really put pressure on regular galvanized customers. So additional galvanize allow us to put more of our product mix in our value added products that also allows us to fully ahead expand to base line down there and as well as sort of the core demand in products and the automotive side that we have taken. So some of those that much more difficult process parameters to control. So this allows us to grow our business in keep in following in line for our customers base. So we are really forward to get this line and continue to take care of the customers we have as well as grow the business. Theresa Wagler : That line is the 400,000 ton line and it\u2019s expected to be sometime in the first half of 2020. And so if you think about it also substantially reduces the amount of exposure that Columbus has of just straight hot roll which should be increased by much higher margin. Glenn Pushis : Glenn Pushis here, on the rebar project at Columbia city, we plan to starting that project up here, commissioning it\u2019s at the end of fourth quarter this year and you asked about reception in the marketplace, obviously we have not made anything yet, but the reception that we are hearing from our potential customers and independent fabricators are very strong, lot of interest in that facility with the spooled coils and the custom cut-to-length that Mark said earlier. Timna Tanners : Okay, so I was referring to the operation that you said you just started up and growing and as also on the Columbus I was referring to Marks comments about over the next several years, even further expansion, so I wasn\u2019t clear on that. Mark Millett : No problem, oak we have started the rebar bundling area and that is where in much better than it did six months ago as we first started that with process. We had some equivalent problems from our supplier there. We are through those and that facility is up in running in much better norm we anticipate that being in full operation, full 2000 ton, pretty year level by the end of this year. Chris Graham : Timna Columbus, a couple of things of it. Obviously as mentioned the $140 million galvanizing line is going to be growth and that comes online in 2020. We are spending about $90 million to $100 million on I would say a enhancements at Columbus, it\u2019s going to give us further product diversification, it allows us to get higher strength to all the grades, it allows us to get the higher strength, heavier-gauge energy pipe and tube grades. And then thirdly you have the paint line and although that is been running for some time and it\u2019s well utilized, obviously they are going through product evaluation and the product although the margin will be enhanced as we get into more HVAC and appliance-type applications. Timna Tanners : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Seth Rosenfeld with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed you are your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Just to begin little bit more for Kentucky Electric Steel. Can you just give us a bit more color on the plant to ramp up trajectory that facility which are the mills we should expect leading to sub straight? And when you think about this asset and the product mix how to consider the margin contribution compared to the base load across division? Thank you. Mark Millett : Glenn? Glenn Pushis : Its Glenn Pushis here. The Kentucky Electric Steel asset that we just purchased when we starting that facility up in two to three weeks. We have got employees hired and we have first order, bill is showing up. We have the materials to run. We have got about 4000 or 5000 ton backlog right now it\u2019s about 12000 tons total that we got here market to start the facility up. Really the play there is we get supplier own ballots. Three of our facilities will supply those steel in less Virginia was supplying Kentucky electric some of the sizes, Roanoke electric steel, and Roanoke Virginia will be supplying some and then some of the Pittsboro facility. So really those are three facilities. We will be feeding that new rolling mill asset, and that will supplement Steel of West Virginia. Mark Millett : So is that from a high level there will be some margin contribution from the asset itself, but the strong advantage is that pull through volume through cycles from those other divisions to low to high utilization rate there. Seth Rosenfeld : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Hi team good morning. I had a question Mark just on the automotive strategy and if you could update us on that in terms of where we are this year, perhaps in terms of volume and where you expect to be in the next couple of years as some of your platforms take off? Mark Millett : We remain through the studies it's around by 30% or so of the 32% of its output is going to almost principally through processes. Columbus, where we pull this more on direct sales to the automotive clients particularly in Mexico they are continuing to gain market share. We are on platforms to take that up to 450,000 tons or so by the end of 2019. So I think it\u2019s going very, very well. Phil Gibbs : And just to frame where do you see Columbus now and how much of your engineer bar business should we think about being automotive as well? Mark Millett : Columbus is -- finished this year [indiscernible] or thereabouts and And SBQ is around about 15%. Chris Graham : Yes, 20% right now Mark, and that is growing because of starting up our new inspection in the bar turning line. A lot of that automotive SPQ still needs to be inspected so we had another kind of bottleneck right in that finishing area so with this expansion project that we are putting in right now starting up that helps us to dwell more and grow that from 15% to 20% now let's say to 25% to 30% in the future. Phil Gibbs : Okay. That is helpful. And then I just have one more Glenn on the engineer bar business if I could. What are you seeing on the energy side, it certainly looks like there has been a mix shift in the markets and more seamless product away from well led, given some of the demands for the EMPs. And has there been any positive stress or strain on your business to supply that more or so for today and greater needs in the future some of the imports restrictions play out? Glenn Pushis : I think from that market right now we are seeing order in three years historical highs both in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And we anticipate that that is going to be continue into 2019. Phil Gibbs : You are saying broadly or for the energy piece? Glenn Pushis : Well broadly I would say the energy piece are certain. Mark Millett : Yes. As we said in the past, our engineer bar is kind of bell weather to the general steel consuming industry or market. And it is literally across the board incredibly strong. It\u2019s for have a highest factor volume as I have for the fourth quarter and literally we will as Theresa pointed out we will see a little seasonal impact on difference in the fourth quarter. We expect things to really, really open up in the first quarter next year. Phil Gibbs : Perfect. And to reside we appreciate the color you provided on the mix straight away. And it\u2019s Heartland about 50/50 as well in terms of contract in spot? Mark Millett : Yes. Theresa Wagler : Yes. Phil Gibbs : Thanks everyone. Operator : Our next question is from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS Securities. Please proceed with your question. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yes, thank you very much. And good morning. Just a quick question on the tariffs, you always mentioned that you think the tariffs are working quite well and we are seeing that in the prices as well. Do you have a preference for tariffs over closer or the other way around? Obviously there has been a little bit of talk about replacing some of the tariffs with closers on Mexico and so and so forth. What in your view is maybe thinking about a framework of the quarters there are in place right now for South Korea. Do you have a preference of what is healthier for the industry, what gives you the more pricing power, a tariff versus a closer going forward? Mark Millett : Well, I think long-term quarter is a probably preference from our perspective because it is allow support of the manufacturing base. Long-term - section two tariffs I do believe is a good stop back but one has to recognize this, and we are going to continue to have a little bit of capacity for some of time to come of that virtually every economy that is mature and or emerge since world war two are all based on excellence, their expert earnings. So there has to be some long-term sort of moderator or moderation of the flow imports on shorts. As a country, we are still short and one of the few countries that is, so we need to imports our manufacturing base needs that product. And I think closers tends to be the better way of controlling that. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That is very clear. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Derek Hernandez with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Derek Hernandez : Hello. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just want to touch on additional growth opportunities that you had mentioned beyond ongoing growth projects which sort of product lines do you see opportunities, and at this time. Mark Millett : Well we have sort of three growth areas of focus. One is just continue to look at steel assets under performing steel assets that we can improve our culture in our business model to some around. Secondly, our team has developed an expertise in processing, main stream processing lines whether they be coded, whether they be painted. So with those opportunities I think are for that. On the fabrication side we have continued growth in debt offerings and then lastly full stream opportunities the big deal aim was to add and improve our margin profile, but more importantly or as importantly would allow a higher through cycle utilization rate and not be redundant, but we really are focused long-term but focused on making sure that our future high are much, much higher than they are today. But as importantly our future levels. We think pull-through volume allows us to achieve that. Derek Hernandez : That is very good. Thank you for the color. And my second question being where do you see potential for cost savings given the current environment is a bit lean towards a bit of inflation there where might you targets opportunities to keep margins strong despite this. Mark Millett : Well I guess, I will kick off first, but I think if you actually look at the most of our operating lines or processes, over time conversion costs remarkably stays somewhat stable and it\u2019s because the team had the continually innovative and creative to become more efficient and more importantly they seem to have an incredible aptitude to push more tons through. And still the increased effectiveness of our operations seems to offset any sort of inflation we cost of materials or commodities. Derek Hernandez : Thank you very much. I appreciate the time. Operator : Our next question is from Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Sean Wondrack : Hi apologies if you touched on this, but can you talk about your seeing in the scrap market and kind of what your expectations are moving in the year end. Russ Rinn : Sean this is Russ, as we look at the scrap market, I think we are seeing a relatively firm market through the year end probably end of the first month or two next year. Again seasonal factors as whether it comes in, but again my opinion is agree with firm this is going to be long what happens on the coast and exports. As exports pick up through a higher level it will become permanently if they remain at the level they are at right now, it will be steady increase but not dramatic one. Sean Wondrack : Okay that is helpful, thank you. And then just more kind of big picture. Can you talk about a little with the impact of tax reform has been on your customers? Do you find some of this optimism is related to that? Or do you think mostly that is worked its way through the system if you could touch on that I would appreciate it? Theresa Wagler : I would not say that its worked its way through the system because the impact of the tax reform obviously the biggest impact was noted in the fourth quarter of this year however to say that that is going to - the systems to have addition projects additional fixed asset investments apparently the higher steel consumption I think that would be always incorrect - hasn\u2019t been sufficient time. In addition to that with the repatriation of volumes coming into U.S. global company that as well just wouldn\u2019t have had time to translate from brining the money in to building new factories to having additional investments in the U.S. in totality. So my expectation is that tax reform actually gives way to what some think is in economy that is already been on the up for a few long, they try to measure in the years and I don\u2019t think that is probably appropriate for this time because I think with tax reform it allows us to have more ways and to last even further. So my personal view - our view is that now that there is still more to come. Chris Graham : Theresa in support of that the fabrication group would note that code activity in retail and hotels is now just starting to increase. And to your point that will take some time to get through the system, but we do assume that some of that might be from the affect of lower taxes on consumer incentive. Theresa Wagler : Excellent, thanks Chris. Sean Wondrack : Thank you. And then just one last one. You obviously had a large revolve outstanding and I apologize. Could you remind me, if you were to get upgraded would that go unsecured? Or have you had any thought about enter the year moving to an unsecured revolver there? Theresa Wagler : So the treasury team did an excellent job and the revolver has a provision, now it\u2019s our choice to execute. Now if we were to get upgrade in any one of the agencies we would have the ability to actually bring into an automatic unsecured revolver which then could allow the other agencies to update as well. So it\u2019s at our election but yes, it\u2019s already there so we don\u2019t have to make a change in the revolver shot for today. Sean Wondrack : Okay, great. Well congratulations on a great quarter and good luck for 4Q. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Lalli with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brian Lalli : Maybe it\u2019s a follow up on actually couple of Sean's questions maybe first on just the investment grade side. Theresa do you have any additional thoughts? Are we kind of in that same place of the positive outlook at both and if you get there great but you are obviously clear on your goals in terms of shareholder returns and M&A? Theresa Wagler : I would say that our goals are still the same on shareholder distributions, on winning it both transactional and organically. That being said just to strength in order we believe the steel markets are going and despite that we think we have different levers to be pulled as Mark\u2019s point both in the high markets and in the low markets. I think we are probably heading toward that IG rating more quickly than what we may have anticipated and we may start talking a little bit more about it kind of in the coming months. Brian Lalli : Got it. Okay. That seems like a little bit of a change that is good to hear. And then I guess the second question I have relates to, it relates to the scrap side of things, but we are starting to hear more and obviously clips for instance talking about building HBI facility. I guess where do you see kind of your iron content and I know this is a longer-term question, but is this something where that you want to compete more at the blast furnace producers you see that there is a greater need for higher iron content. I guess where do you see that in your mix right now that would be helpful. Thank you. Mark Millett : I don\u2019t believe we see a near-term need to increase iron content from a quality standpoint necessarily. We certainly obviously are very aware of the cost, the best mix that get the most economic cost of almost fields into the furnace and at the same time maintain iron that look volatility. So you will see that in Columbus would probably 25%, Barry or thereabout big iron and in Butler we are around about 15% and that is purely an economic decision that we can get pig iron into the Columbus mill at a lower rate of [indiscernible]. Obviously we are creating this project and I think other project and new project that the more iron units coming into the marketplace were better off we and everyone in the electric are going to see there is going to be. Brian Lalli : Got it. Really helpful, Mark. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Fields with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Fields : Hi, everyone. Thanks for all the color and appreciate the updated thoughts IGE outlook. Sort of the bigger picture question, we have kind of seen some small M&A transaction with Heartland and some other ones. Just wondering why we haven\u2019t seen bigger large scale M&A transactions and more consolidation in the steel sector. Is there evaluation gap between buyers and sellers, is there kind of an expectation 800, 900 hot roll is kind of the future forever from a sellers point of view, but the buyers are kind of hold it seller sorry buyers are kind of hold inline? Mark Millett : Well, I would say that folks have a pretty fair to the assets right now. So, yes that valuation is generally are as you would expect through the world of the high, sort of the high end. If you actually reflects, as we reflect on the deals that we have done even going back to the Columbus deal, there has always been other factors in the, in our successful transactions whether it be folks wanting their employees to be in the SDI family, whether they want sort of clarity and some speed of transaction, there are other things that can perhaps play a role and get you an asset not top valuation. But it certainly that is the case. Matthew Fields : Do you see anything changing with that, do you see that pace of consolidation picking up or kind of is this what is it from your outlook. And I obviously appreciate you can\u2019t predict the future? Mark Millett : Well certainly I can\u2019t predict it. I can only say and I can\u2019t speculate is for the outcome. All I can say is that the pipeline is very reactive, there are a lot of assets at some point in time they are likely the I guess being transacted, but it\u2019s a slow process where to say. Matthew Fields : Okay. That is it for me. Thanks very much. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : That concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Alright again thank you for taking time to listen to us today, listen to our story. We are pretty happy with the performance, like I said at the very beginning, I can\u2019t be proud of the team in this room and the other 7700 employees that we have across the nation and Mexico. So from us we want to keep doing what we do best. Provide the greatest shareholders value in our space. So have a great day and be safe. Bye, bye. Operator : Once again ladies and gentleman that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. Have a great and safe day.",

And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning and happy 2019. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings call, and we certainly appreciate and value your time with us this morning. Hopefully, you see the Steel Dynamics team delivered another tremendous performance in 2018. Our strategic growth and market positioning during the last five years was integral to our current performance. Thank you to the entire SDI team for your passion and dedication to excellence in everything that you do. And congratulations to becoming a member of the Fortune Most Admired Company, you moved up to first in the metal sector, and that is an admirable place to be. So thank you for that. And thank you to our loyal customers, vendors and shareholders. On many measures, 2018 was a record year; record operating metrics, record profitability and record cash generation, to name just a few. We have many exciting plans for the coming years as well, but before I explain more, I ask Theresa to provide insights regarding our recent performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I add my congratulations and sincere appreciation to the entire SDI team. It was an outstanding year and numerous milestones were achieved. Record revenues of $11.8 billion derived from higher realized pricing across all three of our operating platforms and record steel and fabrication volume. Record earnings, including operating income of $1.7 billion and net income of $1.3 billion. Record cash generation, including cash from operations of $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion. In recognition and appreciation for this tremendous performance, we have awarded a well-deserved $1,500 cash performance bonus to all non-executive, eligible colleagues in December totaling $12 million. Our fourth quarter 2018 net income was $270 million or $1.17 per diluted share, which includes three items; the additional company-wide performance incentive of $0.04, lower earnings related to our planned outage at Iron Dynamics of $0.04 and lower estimated earnings associated with the planned outages at our Butler and Columbus Flat Roll Steel divisions at $0.06 per diluted share or $20 million. The outages also reduced fourth quarter volumes by about 70,000 to 80,000 tons of flat-rolled steel. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net income was $0.31 per diluted share, above our adjusted guidance. Fourth quarter 2018 revenues were $2.9 billion, meaningfully higher than fourth quarter 2017 sales but slightly lower than our record high achieved in the third quarter sequential results. Our fourth quarter operating income was $366 million, more than 85% higher than fourth quarter earnings but 30% lower than record third quarter sequential results, driven by lower flat-rolled realized sell-in value. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is generally more difficult to translate as weather, seasonality and customer inventory realignment tend to distort true underlying demand dynamics for the coming months. 2018 was not \u2013 was no different, but of note, our performance in the fourth quarter far outpaced that of 2017 and our best fourth quarter operating performance. As we discuss our businesses this morning, you\u2019ll find we are optimistic about 2019 from a macro perspective and even more so because of our unique earnings catalyst. Regarding our steel results for the fourth quarter, shipments decreased 6% across the platform to 2.6 million tons as compared to record high sequential results. Steel metal spreads compressed as our average quarterly realized sales price decreased $48 per ton in the fourth quarter and average scrap costs consumed only decreased $9 per ton. The sales price decline was driven by lower flat-rolled steel pricing. In general, most of our long product steel prices actually increased in the fourth quarter. The result was fourth quarter steel operating income of $402 million. Although lower than third quarter record results, the strong performance is our third best. For the full year 2018, steel operations achieved numerous milestones resulting in record shipments of 10.6 million tons and record operating income of $1.9 billion. Annual metal spread improved as our average sales prices increased significantly across the platform and scrap costs increased to a much lesser degree. While the teams achieved record volumes, we still have more capability in light of our acquisition of Heartland and the numerous production enhancements we made during the year, including cost-effectively accessing the excess melting capacity at our Roanoke constructional steel division. For our metals recycling platform, fourth quarter operating income was $17 million, aligned with third quarter results. Improved average quarterly mill spreads were offset by seasonally lower shipments. Supported by improved domestic steel mill utilization, the metals recycling team increased annual 2018 shipments and earnings and continued to improve operating costs. This resulted in improved annual operating income of $88 million. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model, which benefits from the steel mills and the scrap operations. Two-thirds of their ferrous scrap was fed internally to our own steel mills, increasing their scrap quality, melt efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital requirement. Fourth quarter 2018 operating income for our fabrication business improved sequentially to $15 million. Earnings increased as improved product pricing more than offset the diminishing rise in average steel input costs and seasonally lower shipments. Order activity was strong throughout 2018, and the team achieved record annual joist and deck shipments of 642,000 tons. However, in a rising steel input cost environment, annual operating income was $62 million versus the $87 million achieved in the prior year. We continue to see strong order and strong customer optimism. We\u2019re beginning 2019 with an even greater project backlog than this time last year, which is a positive indicator for nonresidential construction. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we generated a strong $491 million of cash flow from operations, and for the full year, a record $1.4 billion with free cash flow after fixed asset investment of $1.2 billion. Operational working capital grew $284 million during the year based on market improved conditions. Full year capital investments totaled $239 million with almost $190 million used within our steel platforms, including completing the reinforcing bar expansion. We currently estimate 2019 fixed asset capital investments to be in the range of $350 million. However, this does not include any expenditures for the new mill, which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute. Of that $350 million, there\u2019ll be about $100 million related to the completion of Columbus\u2019 third galvanizing line, $100 million broader expansionary and efficiency growth projects and about $150 million related to sustaining capital, including that related to safety and environmental. Regarding shareholder distributions in 2018, we increased our cash dividend in the first quarter by 21% and maintained that throughout the year. We also repurchased 13.1 million shares of our common stock for $524 million, representing 5.5% of our outstanding shares. About $400 million remains authorized at the end of the year for repurchase. Our liquidity increased to over $2.2 billion at December 31, representing nearly $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.2 billion of available funding into our revolving credit facility. Before I hand the call back to Mark, I will share some additional insights regarding the anticipated cash investment time line for our recently announced new Southwestern U.S. flat-rolled steel mill, which is a key part of our growth strategy. The total investment is still expected to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, subject to revisions as we make final site selection, obtain required permitting and finalize the project time line. Based on what we know at this point and assuming timely receipt of required environmental and operating permits, we would expect to begin actual facility construction in 2020, followed by starting operations in the second half of 2021. Based on this time line, we estimate the approximate capital investments to be as follows; in 2019, between $200 million and $300 million; in 2020, between $800 million and $900 million, with the remainder being spent in 2021. We\u2019ll continue to refine these estimates as we make our final site selection and secure state and local incentive. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation, coupled with a strong capital foundation, provides meaningful opportunity for growth and continued shareholder distribution through our positive dividend profile and share repurchase program. We\u2019re squarely positioned for continuation of sustainable, optimized, long-term value creation. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. While safety is and always will be our number one priority, 2018 safety performance did not meet the record incident rate performance we achieved in 2017, somewhat disappointing. But the team has refocused and done a good job reversing the uptick in recordable incidents we experienced in the first half of the year. I\u2019m also encouraged by our continued improvement in our lost time accident rate, which is the best we\u2019ve ever achieved. Nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe work environment. While safety performance remains significantly better than industry averages and the fact that they think about safety at all times, but then is a subconscious. I challenge all of us to be focused and to keep moving toward our goal of zero injuries. To that end, I want to recognize the steel fabrication platform. They not only had record annual production in 2018, but they did it safely, achieving a record 2018 safety performance. The team also did a good job maneuvering within a rising steel input cost environment present through a large part of the year. Our fabrication order backlog remains very, very strong with continued optimism from our customers. This bodes well for non-residential construction demand in 2019. The fabrication platform also supported our steel mills and pushed 370,000 tons of steel internally in 2018. This is a meaningful level to achieve, sustainably high steel utilization through the cycle. In total, our business has sourced almost 985,000 tons of steel internally last year. Our metals recycling team also performed well and supported our steel operations, internally supplying over 3.3 million tons of ferrous material through the year. Annual ferrous scrap shipments and average pricing increased as domestic steel production improved during the year. Our non-ferrous commercial associates should be commended for navigating a complicated set of circumstances given China\u2019s ban on certain recycled material. Despite the issues, we increased non-ferrous shipments, improved earnings and generated new international supply connections. More recently, ferrous scrap accessibility has been steady and dealers have built their inventories. We anticipate supply will outpace demand even with higher steel-related demand through 2019. This is consistent with our long-term scrap view and supports healthy steel metal margins. As Theresa outlined, our steel platform had an outstanding year. The teams executed the highest level, levering a reverse market environment while innovatively optimizing our assets. Domestic steel demand was strong throughout the year. Steel consumption increased based on the strength of the automotive, construction and energy sectors. We also experienced a decline in total finished steel imports on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of consumption. We believe both U.S. and Mexican steel consumption will continue to improve in the coming years, with Mexican growth outpacing that of the U.S. based on meaningful increases in their manufacturing phase. We continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future through optimization of existing operations, organic investments and transactional growth. During 2018, we invested almost $190 million in our existing steel operations and acquired Heartland Steel, a 1 million ton flat-rolled processing facility. We completed a $38 million, 200,000 ton reinforcing bar expansion at our Roanoke Bar Division in the third quarter. We\u2019re the only independent supplier in the area. We also just recently completed a 240,000 ton, $82 million expansion of rebar at our Structural and Rail Division. This expansion includes cut-to-length and cold rebar capability. Our unique rebar supply chain model is expected to meaningfully enhance customer optionality and flexibility, providing significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits to our customers. In addition, we\u2019ll be the largest independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region, and we expect rebar shipments from the Structural and Rail Division to begin next month. Our acquisition of Heartland at the end of June was a great strategic addition, increasing our product diversification through value-added, wider and lighter gauge product capability. Its geographic proximity to our existing Midwest flat roll operations also allows for meaningful value creation. Integration is going well, but there\u2019s still work to be done. We plan to reach an annual run rate of about 80% to 90% of capacity by midyear 2019. Heartland provides a unique margin-enhancing opportunity for us. And these are just some of the numerous organic projects that were completed in 2018 that we\u2019ll benefit for the coming years. During 2018, we also announced further growth for our Columbus Flat Roll Division. In the last two years, Columbus has transformed its product portfolio through the addition of a paint line and the introduction of more complex grades of flat-rolled steel. The shift of product to these diversified, value-added outlet has reduced the amount of volume available to our existing galvanized steel customers. So to address this lack of sufficient galvanizing capacity, in June of 2018, we announced the addition of a third galvanizing line at Columbus. This $140 million investment is another step of further value-added diversification to the mill and less hot-rolled coil exposure. The 400,000 ton line is planned to begin operating midyear 2020. Additionally, during the next 18 months, we plan to invest about $90 million in Columbus to further increase Columbus\u2019 range of complex grade capabilities, including advanced high-strength steels. I\u2019m also excited about the expansive opportunities and long-term value creation of our Southwest U.S. and Mexico growth strategy will provide Steel Dynamics. Each of our operating platforms have an existing presence in the region today, but we\u2019re on the move and planning to meaningfully expand our influence in all platforms. The recently announced plant construction of our new flat roll steel mill in the Southwestern U.S. is a significant piece of the plant. The facility is designed to have an annual production capability of 3 million tons and include a 450,000 ton galvanizing line and a 250,000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability. We estimate the investment to be between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. The new mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc-furnace flat roll steel reducers, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. We\u2019re not just adding production capacity, we have targeted markets and the new mill will have competitive advantages in those areas. We have targeted three regional markets representing over 27 million to 28 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption, and we believe that demand will increase in the coming years. These regions include approximately 8 million tons of demand from the four-state Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas area, which has limited domestic regional supply and relies heavily on imports; secondly, approximately 4 million tons from the underserved West Coast region, which relies heavily on imports as well; and approximately 16 million tons from the growing Northern and Mid-Central Mexican region. Based on their growing manufacturing base, we believe Mexican demand growth will continue to outpace supply, making this an even more attractive, underserved market in the future. A significant competitive advantage lies in the intended location of the facility central to these opportunities. The mill will provide a significant freight cost advantage and shorter lead times to many customers in the U.S. and Mexico regions. This will provide a competitive supply chain that will be an effective option to imports flowing into Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are incredibly excited and have already expressed interest in possibly locating facilities on or near our site. From a raw materials perspective, our Metals Recycling Operations already control scrap in Mexico due to our scrap management relationships, much of which is prime scrap. We also plan to cost-effectively source pig iron through the port systems. Based on our current scrap relationships both in Mexico and the Southern U.S., we are confident in the ability to procure high-quality scrap in the region. Developing our flat roll steel strategy for this region and Mexico has been in the making for several years. We\u2019ve been developing both customer and raw material supply relationships and are confident in the long-term strategic value and investment profile this project provides. We believe our unique operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost-effective and highly profitable steel mills, positions us well to execute this greenfield opportunity. We\u2019re also optimistic about our existing market opportunities for 2019. We believe North American steel consumption will continue to see a steady increase and grow through the year. Furthermore, the actions the U.S. federal government has made to develop a healthy domestic steel industry should provide sustainable, long-term support to the U.S. manufacturing base and continue to erode import volume. Specific to Steel Dynamics, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, support our ability to maintain our best-in-class performance and differentiation. The company and the team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth. Our phenomenal team provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of you for your passion and your commitment to excellence and remind you safety is always our first priority. We are committed to providing exemplary long-term value to our team, our communities, customers and shareholders alike and look forward to creating new opportunities and additional value in the years ahead. So once again, thank you for your time today, and Karen, please open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. Chris Terry : Hi, Mark and team. Thanks for taking my question. Just in terms of the 3 million-ton facility you\u2019re going to build in the south, you mentioned the location strategically with customers. I was just wondering if you could talk through whether you have a baseload commitment, how the qualification period would work for customers and the sort of numbers of customers you\u2019re talking about, please. Thank you. Mark Millett : I think, obviously, it\u2019s a little too early to have a full baseload when the mill is scheduled for a mid-2021 -- summer 2021 startup. I will say, though, that with our Columbus facility, we have good knowledge within the Southwest area, I think 600,000 tons or so, perhaps a little bit more. We have 600,000 to 800,000 tons currently flows into the Southwest and about 120,000 tons flowed into Mexico last year. And we believe that the two mills will be complementary going forward. But nonetheless, we know the customer base is there, and we are very, very optimistic that the baseload will be debarked. We are looking at developing the site with kind of an industrial campus perspective, not unlike Butler. If you were to go to Butler today, we have right next door, I think, five, six, maybe seven facilities employing 1,500, 1,600 folks and consuming a good, I would say, 400,000, 500,000 tons a year, and our strategy will be to emulate that. And the initial customer excitement is, in all honesty, beyond expectation. I think you go -- and this may be simplistic, but if you just take the math and you put little red spots or blue spots or green spots on flat-rolled producing sites at the mills, you see an absolute void in the Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas region, a total void. That region is having to be served at a distance at a high freight number from domestic mills and obviously from imports. A large amount has been served by imports coming through to reduce them. The customer excitement, I think, is that they\u2019ve never had a regional presence there, so they haven\u2019t been able to expand their own operations to an extent that they would like, and they see this as that opportunity. Operator : Excellent, thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Rosenfeld from Jefferies Financial. Please state your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just to follow up on the southwest mill. Can you please give us a bit of an update on broader capital allocation strategy? Clearly, many investors somewhat surprised by that investment last year. Can you give us an update on how you\u2019re prioritizing organic versus inorganic growth moving forward and whether you think the company has firepower for additional growth initiatives that could be announced in the medium term? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Good morning. This is Theresa. Yes, so from a capital allocation perspective, given the time frame over which these dollars are expected to be spent and given the cash that we\u2019ll be generating during that time frame, we firmly believe that we still have the ability to not only grow organically with this facility and with the other projects that we\u2019ve announced thus far, including the Columbus galvanizing line, but we also have the capability to do some transactional \u2013 and to also continue with our shareholder distributions through both the positive dividend profile and the continuation of a share repurchase program. So we don\u2019t believe that this facility in and of itself curtails any of the other opportunities or options that we have from a capital allocation perspective. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Piyush Sood from Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Piyush, are you on the line? Your line is live, please state your question. Piyush Sood : Mark, Theresa, congratulation on the quarter. I saw your full year constructive guide. And when we compare back to what we\u2019re reading and channel checks, seems like there\u2019s an ongoing buyer\u2019s strike. So do you think we should build some level of conservatism in our 1Q outlook and then a shipment rebound in 2Q? Or do you think the buyer\u2019s strike is a little hyped up right now? Theresa Wagler : From a buyer\u2019s strike perspective, I think the question is whether or not you think that we\u2019ll have the benefit of a stronger second quarter. Is that the question? Piyush Sood : That, and in terms of shipments, should we expect something similar to what we saw last year? Or is there a skew that\u2019s maybe leaning towards 2Q or with the second half? Mark Millett : Okay. I think you\u2019re right that there has been some buyer hesitancy. I believe it coincides with a raw material fixture that has been depressed in the last two or three months. As we\u2019ve seen many, many times in the past, when there\u2019s an expectation of continued downward pressure on scrap pricing, the steel consumer expecting lower pricing tends to limit their buy to just what they need and don\u2019t necessary want to speculate on their own inventories. I would suggest, though, that we\u2019re at the bottom. I do think, as we\u2019ve seen and I stated many times before, there\u2019s a tendency for everyone to just jump out of the market, and then all of a sudden, everyone jumps back in the market, and we\u2019re getting to that point. But I do believe underlying demand still remains very, very solid and will grow in 2019. Automotive is \u2013 momentum continues its pace. And I got to say, hats off to our Columbus mill because we continue to pick up market share in automotive. They shipped 400,000 tons into the automotive markets last year. If you remember, just a few years ago, that was almost zero. And the traction of the direct automotive team has been absolutely phenomenal. And we see that continuing to grow as we\u2019re on \u2013 we got commitments on future platforms. So again, kudos to the direct auto team, to John Nolan, who\u2019s been leading that, and Dave and everyone. But for us, auto is a growing market share opportunity. Construction, we continue to see growth there. As you saw, Columbia City had record shipments in 2018. As a sort of barometer through New Millennium Building Systems, we\u2019re seeing a very, very strong backlog there. Activity is \u2013 continues to be very, very strong and up, which I think bodes well for that industry. We\u2019re seeing projects get pushed a little bit back. Those projects are not getting canceled. It\u2019s just getting pushed back, I think, through lack of construction labor. And so that gives, I think, legs, continued legs for that part of the industry. Structural and Rail Division also, I think, benefiting from rail. We\u2019ve got about 30% market share there. We shipped almost, almost my target of 300,000 tons, so congratulations there. And I think that will continue to grow. The tariffs are having an impact on the West Coast. The Japanese, Asian rail is inhibited from coming in, and that\u2019s opening up greater markets for rail in the U.S. Another large market for us, obviously, energy. Energy has remained strong. A little hesitation here and there but having been with several of our very, very large energy customers over the last two to three weeks, they are incredibly bullish. The \u2013 with oil pricing where it is today, the energy companies can make money, will continue to drill, and with that, imports \u2013 I mean, exports are expected to increase. And today, they\u2019re flaring off a massive amount of the gas, which needs to be collected and utilized and levered. So they feel that the collection and distribution pipeline is going to be a very, very strong market for the next two, three years for sure. Then more generally, manufacturing, the other goods, truck, trailer, all remain strong. So we see a very healthy market environment for 2019. And with that, we think that demand or the order rate will pick up here in the next week or two and things will reverse. Theresa Wagler : Let me just add, so Mark gave a great market overview, but as it relates to Steel Dynamics specifically, in addition to that, one should remember that the first half of last year, we didn\u2019t have Heartland within our portfolio. We also really didn\u2019t have the projects that have allowed us to access the extra melting capacity of the Structural and Rail Division in Roanoke, which opens up several hundred thousand tons of additional opportunity for us in 2019. Operator : Excellent. Thank you. And our next question comes from Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please state your question. Timna Tanners : Happy 2019 guys, Mark and Theresa. Mark Millett : Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Timna Tanners : Wanted to \u2013 I know you just went through the demand side. I want to ask you a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing on the supply side, both right now but also once your new mill is starting up. So in light of the current environment, are you seeing fewer imports because we can\u2019t see that on the government website right now? And also, anything you can tell us about the new capacity from Mingo Junction getting absorbed? And then along the same lines, on the supply side, once you start up the new mill, do you envision taking in share from integrated since you mentioned some of the capabilities overlapping there? Do you envision replacing some of the existing Mexican capacity? If you can just discuss that a little further. Mark Millett : I\u2019ll take the \u2013 which order should we go in? I think, generally, on the supply side, much of a supply-demand balance. On coated and \u2013 coated sheet, coated, pre-paint, we see very, very strong demand and supply tightness, I do believe. And so that order book is very, very good for us. Lead times are five to six weeks out in the most part. We are seeing a little softness, and you\u2019re seeing that in the pricing in the marketplace right now. Obviously, in hot-rolled coil, you do have imports of hot-rolled coil specifically jumped up. You also \u2013 as you said, you have JSW Mingo Junction trying to penetrate the marketplace, not with very many tons. Unfortunately, sometimes, it only takes a few tons to pressure a market environment. So we are seeing a little bit of the impact there. Granite City obviously coming back. Again, though, I think once the uncertainty of the environment and the \u2013 not the uncertainty but recognition that scrap pricing is probably going to be a level in the months ahead, people are going to jump back in and start buying. Relative to taking market share for the new mill, again \u2013 and there was \u2013 I got to say that I was a little disappointed with the muted reaction from some of the analyst community on our announcement maybe because we didn\u2019t describe it well enough, I don\u2019t know. But that is a phenomenal \u2013 in my mind, the industrial logic there, strategic logic is incredible and will create a lot of long-term value creation because the mill will be differentiated from a technology process perspective. It\u2019s going to broaden our portfolio of products. We\u2019re going to 84-inch mill. It\u2019s got the capability of, call it, 100 ksi at 1-inch thick, so it\u2019s going to be brew to the mill. And you can consider it \u2013 I guess envision it as a kind of electric-arc-furnace mini-mill kind of hot end with an integrated style sort of cast through hot strip mill. The cast will be a thicker section, and the mill is going to allow us to improve on a thermal mechanical rolling perspective. And that\u2019s going to get us into the high-strength API grades that no electric-arc-furnace supplier can provide today, and it\u2019s certainly sort of a remaining bastion of the integrated mills. So will we gain market share there? I would certainly hope so. And again, we\u2019ll be taking a large chunk of market share from imports. So that 3 million tons shouldn\u2019t be viewed as direct competition to American capability, there\u2019s 68% of energy goods, 68% or so of energy pipe and tube is in the Texas arena. About 40% of that is in Houston \u2013 some amount of tube is flowing into the Houston region. And unfortunately, given the trade expense to get domestic steel down there, the American pipe manufacturers have been at a disadvantage. With us in the region eliminating that trade disadvantage and as informally, given short lead times, they\u2019ll be able to order on a short-term basis. They won\u2019t have to wait for three weeks or four weeks for the stuff to come down the river or two or three months for inputs coming in. Those advantages will certainly allow us to take a large chunk of the import market that\u2019s flowing into Houston. And the sites that we have auctioned can get us to the West Coast on a very freight advantage basis, and that opens up about a 3.5 million to 4 million ton marketplace out there as well. So we\u2019re absolutely incredibly excited by the opportunity, and in all honesty, as we talk to our customers each and every day, I just get more excited. Timna Tanners : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Gagliano from BMO Capital. Please state your question. David Gagliano : Hi, good morning, Mark and Theresa. I have a related question to some of the comments you just made. Obviously, sounds like a phenomenal greenfield project in and of itself. I think part of the reason for the muted reaction is there\u2019s a decent amount of concern out there about the 2021, 2022 bigger picture supply-demand balance. And obviously, just like you\u2019re going to go after market share to the extent of imports, which obviously makes sense, but my question is in a bare case pricing scenario, what type of hot-rolled coil pricing environment would you consider pausing that mill, that expand \u2013 or that project? And at what point would you be too far into the project to put it on hold given the time line that you just touched on a minute ago? Thanks. Mark Millett : We always look at the investments on a through-cycle basis. This is not a trade play, hoping that the trade environment is going to be positive forever. It\u2019s a market play. The mill is going to be able to deliver a differentiated product that certainly no EF producer will be able to produce at least today. That differentiated product going into the southwest market and into Mexico will, I think, allow that mill to have high utilization rate than the typical industry rate at any point of the cycle. So yes, we\u2019re in a steel environment. We\u2019re in a steel industry. We cycle up and down, but we feel that the through-cycle return metrics, the cash generation capability of this mill gives it a very good return for our shareholders. Theresa Wagler : But just as a reminder, and I think you all know this, but when we look at transactional opportunities, we look at through cycle not trying to guess where the cycle is at any point in time to make sure the cash sustainability is there. We also do that with our organic projects. So to Mark\u2019s point, this facility has been tested on the perspective of capital allocation and investment premise and value creation through that. So it doesn\u2019t really matter that we may be in an environment in 2018 where we have peak spreads. We use through-cycle spreads. We will measure that profitability. And we\u2019re not in a point in time yet we will talk about returns on this facility simply because we\u2019re still doing a lot of work along the time lines and looking at what\u2019s the configuration will actually entail from a cost perspective. But when it\u2019s time, absolutely, we\u2019ll happily to do that. Mark Millett : And again, it\u2019s just our belief. And we have always \u2013 when we see a supply chain advantage, whether it be our paint business or whether that be our long rail business, there\u2019s always room for a very, very cost-effective, efficient provider of new products. And so through cycle, I\u2019ve got no concern. David Gagliano : All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Hacking from Citi. Please state your question. Alex Hacking : Hi, good morning, Mark and Theresa and Happy New Year. I have a couple of follow-up questions on the new mill, if that\u2019s okay. Firstly, are there key milestones that we should be looking out for next year? And then secondly, on the 3 million tons, do you have any preliminary estimates about how that\u2019s going to end up in terms of end markets, automotive, energy, you mentioned earlier machinery, et cetera. Thank you. Mark Millett : So from a schedule standpoint, we \u2013 as I said, sites have been certainly auctioned, both including the incentive package negotiations. And I would imagine within \u2013 it gives a little bit of freedom here, but probably six weeks to eight weeks, we should have that in hand. And we\u2019re tweaking that, looking at logistics, rail, just a couple of little things to site here. But then hopefully, eight weeks or so, we should be able to announce the specific site. And once we do, I think you\u2019ll see the incredible strategic logic in that site. From the standpoint of markets, roughly 40% or so moving to Mexico, 60% going into that four-state region. And again, just to remind you, that four-state region has kind of 8 million tons of demand currently. Mexico has roughly 50 million tons of demand, expected to grow by 2025 to, I think, roughly 20 million, 21 million tons. And today, 40 million tons of that are imported, are still short. Theresa Wagler : You mean 40%. Mark Millett : 40%, sorry, is imported. And there\u2019s a dislocation between mill capability within Mexico and demand requirements. And so there\u2019s a growing gap actually between the total sheet and coated as the automobile industry ramps up there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc. Please state your question. Phil Gibbs : Hey, good morning. Just had a couple of questions a little bit on just the statistical side here. So the performance comp, Theresa, and the IDI maintenance piece, where do those flow through on a segment basis? Theresa Wagler : They all roll through the Steel segment because Iron Dynamics is captive with Flat Roll Division. It resides within our Steel segment. Phil Gibbs : Okay. Perfect. And then if I could, the mix on the sheet side? Theresa Wagler : That probably is going to be still up in the cycle. For the fourth quarter, the mix on flat roll products, we had 873,000 tons of hot-rolled and P&O. We had 103,000 \u2013 excuse me, 132,000 tons of cold-rolled and 751,000 tons of coated. Apologies for that. Phil Gibbs : Yes, no problem. And then just to be clear, the $250-ish million at your midpoint for the investment in the new mill, is that something that you definitively plan on putting in, in this year\u2019s numbers? Meaning, is that something that we should be baking into our models? Or should we await basically the go-ahead there with a further announcement? Or is that something that we should basically just go ahead and start thinking is in the numbers? Theresa Wagler : Actually, the first $200 million to $300 million that we\u2019re talking about for 2019 is really downpayments on equipment. It\u2019s purchase of the actual land itself. It\u2019s engineering work. So you absolutely should put that in your estimates for cash allocation. Phil Gibbs : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Derek Hernandez from Seaport Global. Please state your question. Derek Hernandez : Hi, good morning everyone. I just wanted to switch gears quickly on the fabricated backlog being stronger year-over-year. Would this be primarily elevated pricing for the segment? Or do you also anticipate a significant volume increase for 2019 over 2018? Thanks. Theresa Wagler : No, the question relates to fabrication, Chris, and we said the backlog is up year-over- year. And some of that is related to price appreciation that we\u2019ve been able to garner here going into the 2019 time frame, but it\u2019s also volume-related. It\u2019s not\u2026 Chris Graham : Yes. The backlog from a tonnage basis is also up as well, Theresa. Theresa Wagler : And so we\u2019re expecting to see pretty robust volumes next year based on the customer optimism? Chris Graham : Yes. The market chatter regarding 2019 is nothing but positive. The things we watch for, the Architectural Billings Index is still well north of 50, in the 54- plus range. We continue to see a healthy mix of big-box institutional and manufacturing. So everything points to a good 2019. On a New Millennium \u2013 from a New Millennium standpoint, our December bookings were rather robust, up nearly 30% higher than last year. That\u2019s not always indicative of the overall market, but our team is seeing success and positioning itself well for 2019. Theresa Wagler : And I think another point to add to that is that even in 2018 with our record shipments, that really would not just based on market share gain. It was really across the board, the joist and deck shipments in the U.S. or consumption in the U.S. actually improved pretty meaningfully last year. Chris Graham : Yes, it\u2019s the high, obviously since the since 2007, we\u2019re still below what used to be considered the 20 year average of maybe 1.2 million tons a year joist production. I think that the market booked \u2013 industry booked about a little over 1.1 million this year. So we believe there is still runway left there. Derek Hernandez : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Fields from Bank of America. Please state your question. Matthew Fields : Just wanted to get your updated thoughts on investment- grade credit rating with the new mill announcement and maybe some increased shareholder returns. Just wanted to get your current thoughts on how important to you an investment-grade credit rating was and what, if anything, you guys are willing to do to achieve it. Theresa Wagler : Great question, Matt. I expected to have that. So based on, again, the period of time over which these dollars are going to be spent for the new facility, we absolutely believe that our credit metrics can still be maintained at investment-grade levels while doing new organic projects. We do believe that there\u2019s room also for the additional continued shareholder return. And so it would be our expectation that \u2013 I think as I said on the last call, we\u2019ve been dialoguing with the agencies. We\u2019re not in a position at this point in time to make a firm commitment on this call, but we\u2019re definitely having those conversations. Matthew Fields : So would you say it\u2019s sort of as important \u2013 it continues to be more important to you to be investment- grade than maybe a year ago when it would have been nice but not necessary? Theresa Wagler : I would say that\u2019s true. Matthew Fields : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And we have another question from Piyush Sood from Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Piyush your line is live. Do you have another question? And we have a question from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen. Please state your question. Tyler Kenyon : All right. Good morning Mark, Theresa and team. Happy New Year. Mark Millett : Happy New Year. Tyler Kenyon : Thank you. So we talked a bit about sheet supply and demand dynamics and just was wondering if you could cover a little bit more as to what you\u2019re seeing from a demand and supply perspective just within some of the long product categories, so rebar, merchant, structural and SBQ please. Mark Millett : I\u2019ll take the \u2013 jump in the [indiscernible] timing, but I think the engineered bar SBQ world is very, very healthy. We were able to have an uptick in pricing for 2019. Like everywhere else, there\u2019s a slight hesitancy in December as \u2013 because \u2013 although the prices go up, they\u2019re indexed with the scrap. So they\u2019re not sort of speculating on their own inventory. But the customer base is incredibly bullish, I do believe that. Interestingly, down there, the inspection line \u2013 these are small organic projects, but the inspection line down there was commissioned as planned, and I think it\u2019s up and running and is almost at production capability. And we have a turning line up that\u2019s going in there that will get commissioned later this quarter. And those helped draw volumes through the system, certainly needed for the automotive grades that we were ramping up. But generally, a very, very healthy environment at engineered bar. As I said, Structural, Rail Division at Columbia City, very, very strong. Record shipments last year. Pushing up toward a two million ton shipping rate through \u2013 for 2019 will be an expectation there. Merchant and shapes in Roanoke, a little soft. Again, they tend to be impacted probably more than anyone to the rise and fall of scrap. Tyler Kenyon : Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millet for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you, Karen. Thanks for your help today. And to our employees out there, again, a million kudos and thanks for an absolutely outstanding, outstanding year. Remind you to be safe in everything we do. And to our customers and vendors, we certainly can\u2019t do without you, so thanks for your support. And our shareholders, we will continue to demonstrate the growth and shareholder value that we have demonstrated in the past. Expect it going forward. So great, have a great day. Be safe. Operator : Once again ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. And have a great and safe day.",

At this time, I would like to turn this conference over to Tricia Meyers, Investor Relations Manager. Please go ahead. Tricia Meyers : Thank you, Brenda. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Steel Dynamics' first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available on the company\u2019s Web site for replay later today. Leading today\u2019s call are Mark Millett, President and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have leaders from some of our operating platforms, including our Metals Recycling Operations, Russ Rinn, Executive Vice President; our Steel Operations, Chris Graham, Senior Vice President, Long Products Steel Group; and our new Flat Roll Steel Group; and our new flat roll steel mill and Southwest strategy we have, Glenn Pushis, Senior Vice President, Special Project; and Miquel Alvarez, Senior Vice President, Southwest U.S. and Mexico.

You will also find any reference to non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued this morning entitled Steel Dynamics reports first quarter 2019 results. And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call. We appreciate and value your time with us this morning. At this point, Tricia normally provided performance insights, but I'd like to instead pause for a moment to acknowledge the recent workplace fatality that occurred in our structural and rail division. We are saddened and our thoughts and prayers reside within the family and friends. Although, we have some of the best safety specifics in our industry, it brings little comfort at times like this. The reason I always begin our calls on safety is because it's simply cannot be stressed enough. This is our number one value and our first priority. Nothing is more important than staying in a safe environment. We must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and the team members around us. We must actively think about safe at all times, keeping it an ongoing conversation and top of mind. That being said, Theresa, will you provide us some insights with our recent performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2019 net income was $204 million or $0.91 per diluted share, within our guidance range of $0.88 to $0.92 per share. First quarter 2019 revenues were $2.8 billion higher than first quarter 2018 sales, but 3% lower than fourth quarter sequential results as average flat-rolled realized steel prices decline. Our first quarter 2019 operating income was $292 million, 20% lower than sequential fourth quarter results, driven by flat-rolled steel metals price compression. As we discuss our businesses this morning, you will find we are optimistic about 2019 from a macro perspective and even more so because of our unique earnings catalyst. More specifically, our first quarter steel shipments increased 4% sequentially to 2.7 million tons with growth achieved at each division, excluding our structural and engineered bar division. Steels metals price compressed as our average quarterly realized sales price decreased $38 per ton to $902 in the first quarter and average scrap cost consumed only decreased $5 per ton. The sales price decline is driven by lower flat-rolled steel prices. In general, aside from merchant steel, most of our long product steel prices actually increased in the first quarter. The result was first quarter steel operating income of $312 million and although, lower than fourth quarter results historically is strong performance. On March 1st, we acquired 75% controlling interest in United Steel Supply, a leading distributor of painted Galvalume flat roll steel used for roofing and siding applications. We paid cash of $93 million and assume debt of $41 million. The cash payment is still subject to working capital adjustments later in the year. With our recent flat-roll acquisitions, production enhancements and our investments to cost effectively access the excess melting capacity or rolled over the structural steel divisions, we have diversified and increased our product capability. We now have an estimated annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons, including over 8.5 million tons of flat-roll steel and over 4.5 million tons of long product steel. And because of our emphasis on value-add steel, we also have 4.5 million tons of higher margin annual flat roll steel coating capability. And with third galvanizing line is running at Columbus mid-2020, we'll have almost 5 million tons of coating capability. For announced recycling platform, first quarter operating income was $20 million, an 18% sequential improvement based on increased non-ferrous shipments specifically aluminum and higher realized pricing. We continue to effectively leverage the strength of our vertically connected operating model, which benefits both the steel mills and the scrap operations. Over 65% of our metals recycling platform ferrous shipment serve our own steel mills, increasing scrap quality, melt efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital requirement. First quarter 2019 operating income for our fabrication business improved sequentially to $21 million, representing a 39% increase. Earnings improved and realized product pricing increased, and average steel input costs decreased. We continue to see strong order enquiry and customer optimism. We're entering the traditional construction season with a strong project backlog, and expectations for continued solid non-residential construction activity. Our March fabrication backlog is as strong as it was this time last year. During the first quarter 2019, we generated $182 million of cash flow from operations, offset by operating working capital growth of the same amount as there were several annual payments, which are required to be made in the first quarter of this year. For example, our company wide profit sharing payments to our teams was $140 million in March due to our record 2018 earnings. First quarter capital investments were $54 million. We currently estimate 2019 fixed asset capital investments to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million, excluding the new mill, which I\u2019ll address later. This comprised of $100 million to $150 million of sustaining capital, which includes safety and environmental projects, $100 million related to Columbus\u2019s third galvanizing line addition and $100 million for other expansionary and efficiency growth projects. Regarding shareholder distributions, we increased our cash dividend in the first quarter of 2019 to $0.24 per common share, a 28% increase. This solid increase is a 21% last year and 11% in 2017, demonstrating our confidence in the strength and continued growth of our sustainable through-cycle cash generation. We also repurchased $84 million of our common stock during the first quarter. Approximately $315 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Since 2016, we repurchased 23.6 million shares, representing over 10% of our outstanding shares. We maintained strong liquidity at $2.2 billion at March 31st, representing almost $1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.2 billion of available funding under our revolving credit facility. Before I hand the call back to Mark, I will share some updates regarding additional insights pertaining to the anticipated cash investment timeline for our New South Western U.S. flat-rolled steel-mill, which is a key part of our growth strategy. The total investment is currently expected to be approximately $1.8 billion, subject to continued refinement as we make final site selection, obtain required permitting and finalize the project timeline. Based on what we know at this point and assuming timely receipt of required environmental and operating permits, we would expect to begin actual facility construction in 2020, followed by starting operations in the second half of 2021. Based on this timeline, we estimate that approximately half of our investments to be as follows; approximately $300 million in 2019, $850 million dollars in 2020 and $650 million in 2021. We'll continue to refine these estimates as we make our final site selection and secure state and local incentives. We've been making very good progress on these fronts. The strength of our improved cash cycle regeneration coupled with a strong capital foundation provides meaningful opportunity for growth and continued shareholder distributions through our positive dividend profile and share repurchase program. We're squarely positioned for a continued optimized long-term growth creation. And finally, for some of those of you that use flat rolled steel shipments for your model that are broken down. For the first quarter of 2019, our hot-rolled and P&O shipments were 854,000 tons. Our cold rolled shipments were 137,000 tons. And finally, our coated shipments were 867,000 tons. Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Thanks Theresa. As Theresa reported, New Millennium building systems fabrication platform delivered strong performance. Profitability increasing to slight lower shipments, resulting from income as well. Product pricing has improved while steel input costs have decreased, resulting in metal spread expansion. Our order backlog remain strong heading into the summer construction season and a slightly higher than this time last year. Project backlogs are expanding as contractors struggled with the construction labor shortage, which should prolong this long residential construction cycle. The ongoing strength of this business and continued customer optimism bodes well for non-residential construction demand. Our metals recycling team also performed well, improving profitability in the quarter as non-ferrous volumes in metal spread increased, especially related to aluminum. Conversely, ferrous volumes contracted modestly. Ferrous scrap availability has been steady with strong automotive sectors generating a more than ample supply of prime scrap. We expect seasonal flows with cut and shredded grades will continue to pick up and outpace demand. We expect actual volumes to remain constrained through the rest of the year. And this is consistent with our longer term scrap view that pricing will remain stable in support of healthy steel sheet metal margins. The steel platform delivered a solid first quarter performance in a somewhat challenging flat-rolled steel pricing environment. Flat-rolled steel prices began a downward trend in the second half of 2018, which continued through mid-first quarter reaching an inflection point in February. As prices softened, bias remain on the sideline, yet our teams were able to increase flat roll shipments to help offset some of the margin compression. The good news is that underlying demand remained intact. Flat roll pricing increased and order input rates returned, thereby regaining healthy lead times. While industry shipping rates eased in the first quarter 2019 due to 35 day government shut back and abnormally cold and wet weather in many parts of the country, long voyage rates and interest costs should increase construction and higher oil prices could boost energy sector demand in the coming quarters. We further believe both U.S. and Mexican steel consumption will continue to improve in the coming years, with Mexican growth outpacing that of the U.S. based on meaningful increases in their manufacturing base. We continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future through optimization of existing operations, organic investments and transactional growth. During 2018, we've reinvested on our existing steel operations and acquired Heartland, a 1 million ton flat rolled processing facility for additional value add product diversification. We also recently acquired a 75% controlling interest in United Steel Supply to further enhance our prepaying supply chain. We completed the $38 million and 200,000 ton a year rebar expansion at our Roanoke Bar division in the third quarter, becoming the only independent supplier in that region. In the first quarter 2019, we also completed 240,000 ton per year $82 million rebar expansion in our structural and rail division. This expansion includes cut-to-length and cold rebar capabilities. Our unique rebar supply chain model is expected to meaningfully enhance customer optionality and flexibility, providing significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits. In addition, we'll the largest independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region also. We shipped our first full rebar in February. We acquired Heartland in mid-year 2018, increasing our flat roll product diversification through value added wider and lighter gauge product capability. Its geographic proximity to our existing Midwest flat roll operations also allows for meaningful value creation. Integration is going well and the team is setting new production levels and productivity. The facility was supposed to higher cost inventory acquired through an acquisition through most of 2018. We still plan to reach an annualized run rate of over 80% of capacity by mid-year. The innovative spirit of the whole team throughout the organization remains intact, and they will have numerous smaller organic projects that were completed in 2018 and will benefit in the coming years as well. During 2018, we also announced further growth from our Columbus Flat Roll division. In the last two years, Columbus has transformed its products offering through the addition of the paint line and the introduction of more complex grades of flat-rolled steel. The diversion of products to these diversified value-added outlets has reduced the volumes available through our existing galvanized steel customers. So to address the lack of sufficient galvanizing capacity, we announced the addition of a third galvanizing line at Columbus. The $140 million investment is another step of further value-add diversification for the Columbus mills and less hot-rolled coil exposure. The 400,000 ton line is planned to begin operation mid-year to 2020. Additionally, during the next 18 months, we plan to invest about $90 million at Columbus to further increase the range of complex grade capabilities, including advanced high-strength steels to both the automotive and energy sectors. In aggregate, these upgrades will reduce the availability of about 400,000 tons from FDI Columbus of non-coated flat roll steel into the Southern U.S. by the year 2021. This will coincide with the timeframe that we plan to begin operating our plan of new flat roll steel mill in the Southwest. We're continuing to be increasingly excited by the expansive opportunities and long-term value creation of Southwest U.S. and Mexico growth strategy will provide Steel Dynamics. Each of our operating platforms have an existing presence in the region today, but we're on the move and planning to meaningfully expand our influence in the region. The plant construction of our new flat roll steel mill in the Southwest is a significant piece of that plan. The facility is designed to have an annual production capability of 3 million tons, and will include a 450,000 ton galvanizing line and 250,000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability. We estimate the investment to be approximately $1.8 billion. The new mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc-furnace flat roll steel reducers, and competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. Having a thicker our cast section and a more conventional two-stage hot rolling pressers. The mill capability will provide higher frac, tougher materials to the energy and automotive markets. The mill will be capable of 84-inch wide, 1-inch thick, 100 ksi hot rolled coil. Downstream value-added capabilities will include galvanizing and pre-paint. And to be clear, we're not just adding production capacity, we will have the differentiated product portfolio, we'll have a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and we have targeted models. The new mill will have in fact three targeted regional markets, representing over 27 million to 28 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption. And we believe this demand will continue to increase in the coming years. Those regions include approximately 8 million tons from the -state region of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which has limited domestic regional supply and relies heavily on imports; approximately 4 million tons from the underserved West Coast region, which also relies heavily on imports; and finally, about 16 million tons from the growing Northern and Mid-Central Mexican region. Based on their growing manufacturing base, we believe Mexican demand growth will continue to outpace supply, making this an even more attractive underserved market in the coming years. A significant competitive advantage lies in the intended location of the facility, central to these targeted market regions. We\u2019re still likely to be pursuing sites in both Texas and Louisiana. The mill will provide a significant freight cost savings and delivery time advantage to many customers in the U.S. and Mexican region. This will provide a competitive supply chain, but have the new mills to effectively compete with imports slowing into Houston and the West Coast that inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. Customers are excited and have already expressed interest in possibly locating facilities on or near our site. From a raw materials perspective, our metals recycling operation already controls a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico due to our scrap management relationships, much of which is prime scrap. We also plan to cost effectively source pig iron through the port systems. Based on current scrap relationships, both in Mexico and the Southern U.S., we are confident in the ability to procure high quality scrap in the region. We've been developing the flat roll steel strategy for this region and Mexico for several years. We've been developing both customer and scrap relationships, and we\u2019re confident in the long-term strategic value and investment profile this project provides. We believe our unique and operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience and successfully constructing and operating costs effective and highly profitable steel mills positions us well to execute this greenfield opportunity. We\u2019re also optimistic about our existing market opportunities for 2019. We believe North American steel consumption will continue to see a steady increase. Furthermore, the actions taken by the U.S. federal government has developed a healthy domestic steel environment and should provide sustainable long-term support for the U.S. manufacturing base. These actions will continue to erode import volume, while increasing effective import price. We anticipate reciprocal 232 tariffs between the U.S., Canada and Mexico will be replaced by alternative effective quarter base programs among the USMCA countries prior to ratification of the agreement later this year. Specific to Steel Dynamics, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, clearly demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification and low cost operating platforms, support our ability to maintain our best-in-class performance and differentiation. The company and the team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth. Our exception team provides the foundation for our success. And I thank each and every one of you for your passion and commitment to excellence and remind you, safety is always the first priority. We are committed to providing exemplary long-term value to our fellow colleagues, to our communities, to our customers and to our shareholders, and look forward to creating new opportunities for you all in the future. So again, thank you for your time. And we would like to open the call up for questions now. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies. Martin Englert : Your commentary on demand remains generally positive, expecting continued growth in North America this year. Can you discuss how much of that growth is coming from the core end market versus maybe Steel Dynamics taking market share from either imports or competitors? And then any other additional detail you can provide on potential growth ranges anticipated for steel consumption here? Mark Millett : So obviously demand I think has been a big question relatively for all. I think one have to reflect back a little bit and understand why the fourth quarter was a little soft. It was a tough quarter from an economic standpoint; you had a 35 day government shutdown, you had an inclement weather, you've customers' sentiment -- people sentiment generally was a little a down. You have lingering recessionary concerns overhanging the fourth quarter. You have trade war, rhetoric and softening raw material price expectations. So I don't think it was surprising at all honestly, but you saw all the softness there. That softness inflected in February and our order input rates picked up dramatically, pricing picked back up. And today our lead times are very, very healthy for hot rolled coil that through the end of May, which is exactly where we'd like to see them. And we're actually a little long to be honest in coated and pre-paint we're anywhere higher than six to eight. So we see at least from our order books a very positive environment. I think order backlog remain strong. I think energy has been very good to us. And I think to the industry in general. And as we meet with our energy, pipe and tube customers, they seem to be very bullish going forward. The gas oil transportation infrastructure needs to continue to be built at, particularly with the very large LNG projects that are happening along the coast in the Southwest. So we see energy being very, very, very strong for next several years. Manufacturing base is healthy and we see construction remaining healthy. As I said earlier, [indiscernible] into non-risk construction through New Millennium Building Systems is very positive, and our order backlogs are higher this time this year than they were last time. So I think generally, a very positive environment for the rest of the year. A - Theresa Wagler : So Martin, specifically as it relates to whether its market share or fundamental core sector growth, we expect to see in consumption domestically probably about 2% growth year-over-year based on our own projections. But then there is some of that specific to Steel Dynamics where we have continued to take market share, specifically in automotive and some of the energy markets as well. So it's a combination of both. Martin Englert : And if I could one quick follow up, volumes on SBQ do appear down here year-on-year. Can you discuss what you're seeing with demand there and the end users, and why volumes were lower? Mark Millett : Well, I guess we permit a little bit of skittishness in the SBQ market. I think suppliers are getting some pushback on current pricing. Most mills are on pull at this point. People are looking for volume discounts, but we think some of it\u2019s in inventory corrections. Most are still optimistic regarding the second half of '19. I'd say that\u2019s what's driving that. I've spent a couple days at the North American Steel Alliance, which is a gathering of a lot of the -- the family along the smaller processing steel distributors. And I'd say to a customer and they were all very focused only on the market outlook. They are a little cautious with inventories and so they are not speculating in any way shape or form, but it's a positive environment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : First question is just on the profitability of the steel op segment this quarter. If you look at the ASP increase relative to scrap increase your metal spread was up about $53 a ton year-on-year year, but EBITDA per ton only $9. So I'm just curious what were some of the other moving pieces around cost inflation, electrodes and things like that you could identify? Theresa Wagler : So Curt, when you're looking year-over-year, the biggest change that you're seeing is the electrode costs. Our electrodes didn't start increasing cost until the second half of 2018, because we had different inventories that were layered in. And so it's almost $20 million quarter-over-quarter increase in just electrodes alone. But if you were to do that same comparison on the sequential fourth quarter, it's basically flat. So you're seeing the highest -- higher input costs and that\u2019s basically the change in year-over-year. Curt Woodworth : And then follow up just on the new 3 million ton mill. Mark, how do you think about the cadence of layering production, I mean 3 million tons is almost a 50% increase to your current footprint on a productive capacity basis for sheet, so clearly pretty transformative. Is your strategic imperative is that you'd want to try to quickly gain that market share and maybe be more disruptive, or what's the strategic philosophy in terms of how quickly you could ramp to 3 million tons? And would you like to stagger it as well? Mark Millett : Well, we have no intention of staggering it. And I think the market will be very, very receptive and at least from all countries to-date, they're incredibly receptive. I think one has to recognize that in Southwest region, right now, there's a vacuum of domestic supply. This mill is going to have some minimum of $30 plus trade advantage over any domestic mill, plus its right in the heart of the import to reduce them. So we have trade advantage there and probably even more importantly, a lead time advantage. When folks are bringing imports and they have got a two, three, four month lead time and price speculation, I think we're going to gain massive volume or market share of that import downstream. And it's going to allow the pipe producers, steel producers in that region in Louisiana, as well as Texas compared to the scope that they haven't been able to procure at this point. And that will allow a massive amount of pipe and tube imports as well. So I think you've got to consider -- again, this should avoid the supply today, and I think this mill is going to supply, it's going supply the four-state region. As I said earlier, it's 7 million, 8 million, 9 million tons onto itself. It's a very competitive freight rates to the West Coast about 3 million to 4 million ton market, and they are suffering on the supply side dramatically today. Plus, we're within $30 million freight of the Northern Mexican markets run rate, in particular and that's a growing region. It's 15 million tons, 16 million tons today and that's predicted to be 20 million plus over the next three to four years. So I have no doubt of the ability of that mill to penetrate the market and pick up market share very, very quickly. Theresa Wagler : In addition, Curt, I don't think you can emphasize enough the fact what Mark said early is that we've got considerable number of customers that actually want to move on campus. And so, that's going to help to ramp up that facility as well. Mark Millett : And also if you look at or if you reflect on any market that we've entered in the past, most of those markets actually have been over-served in any event. And our strategy has always been to differentiate ourselves, to create value from the supply chain, which obviously creates value to the end user and to the customer. And this mill is very, very different from many other electric-arc-furnace facilities to today. You can understand as electric-arc-furnace mini mill with hot rolled mill. So the two-state rolling, which will allow us to do thermal mechanical rolling, adds strength, capability, adds toughness. So our mill offerings 84 wide up to 1 inch, 100 ksi material is very, very differentiated and can only be really accessed by the integrated mills today and there at least probably have $50 to $60. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Korn : So I appreciate the new detail on CapEx from the new mill. Question is, given the number of new furnaces announced in or near construction. Is there any constraint on available engineering talent? I imagine that the population anybody really experienced in leading in the area of build out is fairly small and well bid. And then you also mentioned timeliness in your approvals. What is the timeline on permitting, what should we be watching for? Is that a second quarter, second half? Where's the calendar there? Mark Millett : Glenn? Glenn Pushis : This is Glenn Pushis. We're going to project that pretty much full time now. We've got our environmental permit in place of Texas application, we're being told it about a one year process for that. And we're really not finding anything -- to your question on engineering talent, we're really not finding any real challenges there. It seems to be that there's lot of people that\u2019s in available engineering time and are ready to jump on the project that pretty quickly here. Mark Millett : And to answer that again, it\u2019s the best way I model. I was in the conference room, watching the folks leading what we call the war room that in our basement. And there\u2019re probably a dozen individuals just walking out at the end of the day. And it's just amazing the amount of knowledge and talent and experience we have within our organizations and designing, procuring and building constructing, signing up large capital assets. And so at the middle of the day the team is going to perform annual review as well. The equipment itself has been spec out and Glenn and team, I think expects to have that all placed in the next two weeks. Matthew Korn : Let me ask in on the scrap market. Week-after-week, we see domestic steel production up year-over-year, utilization rates are higher. Naturally, that would mean the drawn scrap should be higher. Yet, global steel production keeps growing, global iron ore prices are substantially higher, which all of constant should be a tailwind for scrap prices. So why have scrap prices remained so moderate? And does it come down to we should especially expect finished steel prices to lead scrap moving forward and not the other way around as has been in the past? I'd love your opinion on that. Russell Rinn : This is, Russ. I think the biggest difference in the U.S. market today is the export market. Again, you've got a tepid export market, which means the scrap is staying on the coast and it's more accessible. Therefore, it's a little bit higher to buy than what we've seen probably in the past decade or so. Obviously, that could change the heartbeat and you can certainly look at the fact that iron ore has traded at $9 range, per ton range and use the standards 4.5 times, it shouldn't be higher in price. But when there is excess scrap we're paying around, it's all facing a smaller market because they lack exports. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : I just had a question on the overall market dynamics I just wanted to flush out a little bit. In terms of your comments that there was an inflection point around the middle of February, we started to see pricing move up on the back of that. And then I guess linked to the question before on the scrap environment, we're seeing that easing the last couple of months. How you\u2019re seeing activity at the moment and the pricing environment? It seems like things have eased a little bit, but you\u2019re still very positive on the demand story. So just want to think about spreads in the next couple of quarters and overall pricing dynamics for the end products and also scrap? Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, I think as Russ said, we look for the stable scrap pricing, going forward, the rest of the year and maybe soften a little bit this coming month. But again, 10, 20 is not massive move so stability on the [indiscernible] side. On the pricing side, yes, if the inflected went up and it's eased a little. But if you look at the arbitrage to foreign pricing today, it's pretty well evaporated, imports are still under control on an annual basis it'll be under control and probably will continue to erode through the year. So, I think the market pricing presenting is going to be relatively stable. So spreads will remain healthy. Matthew Korn : And then just following up on your comments a bit earlier around the Section 232 quotas versus tariffs. Can you just talk a little bit more about that and the timing you expect on that from Steel Dynamics' point of view? Mark Millett : Well, I think we would say absolutely totally speculative but I don\u2019t think. And our intelligence would suggest that the progress is being made in China and the progress is certainly being made in the USMCA. That would likely change to a quota based agreement. Those quotas based on certain level of historic import levels with the tariff for any exceeding through the overlap, and I think that will be a positive outcome for all three countries. On the trade move that we actually are seeing some pretty positive outcome, it's three of one I guess prefabricated imports. That action is underway, hasn't been concluded yet but we're already seeing some of the larger projects that will bid out and destine to the Chinese steel, prefabricated Chinese steel coming into country. Those are now being rebid and I think that's a very, very positive sign for our non-products metals market in general. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Wedbush. Brett Levy : Hey, guys, it's the recipe questions. You guys are adding 3 million tons, you're adding galvanizing, you're adding the width. You're getting potentially from Cliffs and other people, iron ore feed be very pure. Have you guys gone and I'm guessing you have and just asked to see if you can make the recipe, or maybe the hood of a Chevy or a Dodge, in terms of rolling pattern alloys, galvanizing all of the pieces of the puzzle, because it just doesn't seem right. You just build it and expect them to come. I would think that you probably have done some work on this and can you give any clarity on that? Mark Millett : Well, first and foremost, we're certainly not a builder of dreams. As I said many times before, we don't manage the hope. We do things that control our own destiny. I think the teams -- obviously, in Butler, they've been supplying roughly 30% of their output to the automotive growth for years -- years and years. And the Columbus team has built a phenomenal following already, particularly with the higher strengths of advanced peoples, and are attaining incredible acceptance, particularly with the European automotive producers, BMW, VW, for instance. And this the new mill just adds to that. As we said, the two-stage rolling, the thicker cast slab will allow us to get the best steels for automotive and much stronger steel. And will allow us to get the tougher, thicker steels for the energy markets, API grade. So I think the opportunity for the market is definitely in front of us. We just have to get the thing up and running by 2021. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Timna Tanners : I don't want to beat the topic up too much here on the near-term market conditions. And I know we talked a little bit about your demand outlook, but one thing I wanted to ask you about is. Why do you think domestic prices have narrowed so much the gap between imports, like a lot of on the flat rolled side hot rolled in particular prices have been below landed import level so well? Do you see like a lot of extra steel competing? Is this a short-term thing? What's your sense of why prices for domestic mills are below important landed levels? Mark Millett : Well, there remains a slight hesitancy. As I said, the customer base is fairly optimistic for business conditions and demand for the rest of the year. That being said, they're cautious on inventory. So they're buying steady as she goes and again with the addition of little bit more capacity, maybe stressed supply-demand a little bit. But from all we can see, Timna, the market through our own order book and that remain strong. As I said, we're right through the end of May with all that and we're too long in my own opinion on the [indiscernible] and prepaying. Timna Tanners : And then -- our channel taxes just that there's too much supply. So that's what I was trying to get at is, there seems to be this fight for market share is what we're hearing. And I was just wondering if you're getting that sense from the field as well, but I can make leave it there. And then just on the new mill, I don't understand the Mexico commentary. I just want to understand a little bit better. If I look at the Mexican net imports plus production, I come up with about a 30 million ton market. And between the two new rolling mills Ternium and ArcelorMittal that are coming on next few years, it's what 5-plus million new tons. And then your mill is also talking about targeting these tons. And I know you said demand is growing. But how are you looking at that equation? Can you talk us through a little bit more of that detail please? Mark Millett : Well, again, the market is still short for sure. Yes, Ternium is going to add a little bit capacity we think, you don\u2019t know until it's actually on board. Arcelor is adding hot rolled coil capacity. So, there's a vision now and that is way down in the Southwest. So they've got a massive freight to get it up to the lower end. And I think you also need to understand there're product capabilities efficiencies within Mexico that our mill is going to do serve. Miquel, you've got some thoughts? Miquel Alvarez : Yes, I mean, I just listened that you mainly spend your last comment on the product capabilities that we're going to have for the mill compared to what it's offering in Mexico. We've been talking to a lot of consumers in Mexico. We have confirmed that the broad capabilities that we're going to have on the mill are going to make a difference in the market. So the capacity that is being added in Mexico, its capacity that in fact you may want to continue to compete with some of the domestic mills there where we're going to offer [indiscernible] probably inflation some of the tonnage that is being importing from other countries. So we feel very confident about quickly gaining market share there. We just got capabilities that we're going to have. Timna Tanners : So those capabilities would be not just the galvanize I'm assuming, because there is three galv lines coming on in Mexico as well. So, you're talking about capabilities aside from finishing, so maybe like the wider gauges or maybe the thickness. Is that what you're talking about? Mark Millett : There's a combination of width, gauge and strengths. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Piyush Sood : Couple of questions, first one on the fabrication business. You would have picked up higher price orders throughout last year. So wondering whether you've seen all those higher price orders come through the results already? Or is there more to go through the year? Theresa Wagler : From a fabrication perspective for the backlog, actually we've increased prices pretty effectively in the first quarter of this year and we would expect to see that continue honestly through the year. And that in combination with the lower steel pricing that is now in the inventory for the fabrication business should result in higher spreads than you would have seen in 2018. Piyush Sood : And going back to spreads, I just want to understand that the spread between hot roll and cold roll has widened closer to about $150. So, is the market much more tighter on cold than on cold and coated versus hot roll? Also, how sustainable do you think that difference in the tightness is? Mark Millett : Well, certainly on the coated side, galvanize side and pre-paint side things are very, very healthy. We actually have not necessarily been a major player in coated sheet. Although, that's a marketplace we'll be venturing through the Heartland acquisition. But I think on the coated pre-paint spreads those will be maintained. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Matthew Fields : Thanks for the detail on the CapEx schedule for the new mill. Is it your intention at this point to fund the construction spending through free cash flow generation and not any additional debt incurring? Theresa Wagler : Right now, Matt, our current intention is to watch the capital markets throughout the year. And you see our capital structure today and you will see that we have some notes that are actually stepping down on pricing. So, I think we're just going to continue to monitor the market. We definitely believe we could do that but that might limit some options as we do other things. So I think it's something that we're going to wait and see what happens in the capital markets this year. Matthew Fields : And then as you enter this period of elevated CapEx spending over the next few years, against the backdrop that some of the other analysts have mentioned with all this new supply coming on from other producers. Is there leverage level that you would like to maintain as you're spending all this cash building this mill? Theresa Wagler : Well, certainly obviously, yes. Today, obviously, Matt, leverage levels are quite attractive. I think our net leverage is less than 1 times at the end of the quarter. But during this cycle, we've consistently said and we really like to maintain that through cycle net leverage somewhere between 2 and 3 times. And so with that, we believe that we\u2019ll be able to effectively do that even with the elevated levels of CapEx spending, because I think one need to keep in mind that we have all these earnings catalysts that are also coming online this year. For example, the rebar project the Structural Rail Division, we just started shipping rebar in the first quarter of this year. So by the third quarter of this year, we expect to be up to about 90% to 95% capacity, and that\u2019s quite a bit of additional volume. And that's why I may have mentioned the fact that our shipping capability today is over 13 million tons. So I think one needs to keep in mind that there's earnings catalysts that will be kicking in along with that additional spending over the next two to three years. Matthew Fields : And then last question for me. How do you balance the $2 billion you intend to spend on the mill, some acquisitions you're making along the way, share repurchases and dividends with the goal to get investment grade? Theresa Wagler : Well, right now, I think we have the ability to have what we'd like to call balanced approach to the capital allocation, which you've seen us doing. If we are going to see a larger acquisition or transaction, you\u2019ll probably likely see us go back a little bit on the share repurchases in advance of that or in combination with that, because that's a lever that we can use quite effectively. Otherwise, I think you should expect to continue to see a positive dividend profile from us what you've seen over the last long period of time actually along with the additional capital that we've been spending with expectations for that continued cash flow generation. So I think you're going to continue to see us do what we've been doing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Olin with Longbow. Chris Olin : I get the whole underlying thesis that import quotas have a better long-term impact on the U.S. steel industry. I guess my question is when you start thinking about the new NAFTA agreement, or I guess I should say the USMCA. Once we see a shift from tariffs to quotas. Is there going to be potentially a destabilizing effect as the market need to reset and could that explain some of the slowdown in orders heading into a final decision? Mark Millett : I don't believe so. I think the final USMCA agreement will be based on past levels of trades. As such, there\u2019ll be some stability there more than anything else. Chris Olin : So the market will naturally be set the lower import prices, especially when you look at some of these long products being under priced before the tariffs. So I don't need to adjust for that at all? Mark Millett : I don\u2019t think so. Operator : And our next question comes from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Phil Gibbs : Mark, in terms of the United Steel Supply deal. Is that something we should expect you all to do moving forward in terms of making more of these downstream acquisitions similar to what Mittal does in Europe? Or was this more of a one-time special situation? Mark Millett : Phil, I don't look at U.S. Steel Supply as being the European model of steel mills entering the steel distribution processing space. I think this is very unique to our supply chain for prefect. You might see us continue to expand in that very unique specific area, but it's not my intent to become a steel processor or distributor in any way shape or form. Phil Gibbs : And is this business going to get talked in the steel or fabrication? Theresa Wagler : Actually, it's already been reported through steel field, and you'd have -- their shipments would have been reported in the coated shipments that I gave you earlier on the call. Phil Gibbs : And then I just have a one follow-up. Typically in the release, you give changes in profit per part of the steel business, whether that's flat rolled or long products I think that's the way you discussed it in the past. Any color you can give us on directional -- although directional change I think we know. But in terms of the magnitude of the change in each of those divisions would the helpful? Theresa Wagler : So typically, it's part of the message we try to give sometimes the difference between flat rolled products. I would just say that flat rolled profitability was down, probably somewhere between 20% and 25% versus long products profitability being down maybe around 10%. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Mark, I'm going to ask a deliberately dumb question that I think all of us are probably confused by. There's potentially at most 10 million tons of new electric furnace SMS tin slat hot stripped mill capacity. If both you and Big River build the new plants in the Texas Gulf Coast vicinity and Big River Doubles and Arkansas, Nucor Doubles Gallantin, maybe delta expanding as a slightly different than SMS design. So, on the surface it might appear to some people in the investment community that they're all identical designs. And I'm might worry that an SMS coil sells at $25 or $50 discount, because they're all the same and/or so middle has different designs, different marketing practices and might not for example be impacted as much. Now, we know that you sell a lot of painted still. Nucor is putting in a six high cold mill into Hickman with four work rolls. Probably everybody's doing their best to buy clean metallics. How will your design be different so that everybody isn't selling the same SMS coil? Mark Millett : I guess you've asked a very fair question. No, I don't think it's a dumb. I may give the answer. I think I can't see for any future mills installed by any other future entrants. But as of the projects today, ours will be a very, very I think differentiated project in the honesty. Again, the cap section with combination is going to be unique. No one is going to able to make 84 wide, 1-inch 100 ksi product, that not when we able to make a 13 to 50 -- 50 ton coil\u2026 Unidentified Company Representative : 13, 50 to full width, 16, 50 to narrow width, so it's a very large flow\u2026 Mark Millett : So, the yield improvement of the large coil, John, to a pipe and tube is probably in the order of 5% to 6%. So again my comment earlier is anytime we've entered the market no matter what it is, whether its rail, whether it's pre-paint or whether it's rebar. We look for differentiating angles from a technology and supply chain value-add, and I think this provides it. In addition to that, the color considered the geographic location. Gallatin is in Kentucky. These other facilities still remain a long distance away from the market. They can't get to the West Coast for 55 bucks. They can't get to the market or the regional market that we're going to be able to supply anywhere close to the freight cost that we'll be able to avail ourselves. So again, I think this project is very, very FDI specific, it's unique. And people said we based this decision on trade, and absolutely not. This is a market based expansion for us and I think the investment profile is going to be an absolute going forward. Unidentified Company Representative : Mark, I think it maybe me important to note that my understanding is that Glenn's team have now selected a mill supplier, and that we're not buying a model number off the shelve that we have specified a mill that probably no one built before and all the suppliers are looking for a solution to fit your expectations there. Mark Millett : This is a very good point. You just embraced SMS being the mill of provider of choice for everyone, that's not necessarily the case. John Tumazos : So you might go with a different design and a different equipment supplier in your new mill? Mark Millett : Glenn and the team are evaluating two -- well, depending on the equipment but the hot-stripped mill cast are -- hot side two basic vendors. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Sean Wondrack : I just have a follow-up on one of your earlier comment. So, you've stated you expect through-cycle net leverage in a 2 to 3 times range, and I think your net leverage is somewhere closer to 0.7 turns right now. Even if you were to lump on $2 million project, you're still going to be below 2 turns. So when you talk about 2 to 3 turns, is that somewhere you expect to be? Or do you think that's more of a ceiling to where your leverage would go? And is it better to think about distributable cash flow from your eyes in terms of the leverage you could pull back on or accelerate? Theresa Wagler : Yes, so 2 to 3 times is again in the ceiling area. It wouldn't be somewhere where we would be sustained on a through-recycle basis, so that's a correct statement. Sean Wondrack : So it's more of a ceiling, you're obviously embarking on these projects, leverage may move up a bit but you wouldn't expect it to go anywhere higher than 2 to 3 times. Is that what you're saying? Theresa Wagler : That's correct. But remember that when I was answering that question, that wasn't just about organic projects that also include any potential transactions from time-to-time that may arise. Sean Wondrack : And I'm just looking at this again where enterprise multiples are trading somewhere in the 4 to 5 turns range for a lot of companies. It seems like 3 turns would be a lot of leverage on the business given that backdrop, because that makes a lot more sense. All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Mark, today, there are certain I guess generally accepted practices and financial analysis like EBITDA ratios. A defect in EBITDA ratios are the selling price changes or the metal margin changes. It doesn't change -- it does change, it could be -- EBITDA can be illusory at the top of the economy, for example. When I was a little boy 40 years ago beginning to do financial analysis, debt divided by debt plus equity was calculated. A conservative way to look at equity is to exclude goodwill for tangible network. Steel Dynamics isn't as strong a credit using the ancient debt-to-debt plus equity tangible equity ratios. And I just want to remind you and I might sound like the smart-arse, the guy that popularized EBITDA ratio, Mike Milken, went to jail even though it's generally accepted today. Do you worry that your balance sheet is too levered just in case there's a bump in the road and the world economy changes? Mark Millett : Well, I am not worried at all. I think our business model, again, is differentiated in good times, bad times, quarter-to-quarter. It's demonstrated the ability to generate cash, a superior rate than our peers. I agree and I'm -- I don't what the relative ages are. I turned 60, so I've been in the industry for the 35 or whatever too many years. And I remember people would be focused on net earnings, not necessarily so much EBITDA. We still look at that, things, projects and have to make money, not just cash per se. And all I can tell you, John is reflect on our past performance. I think it's demonstrated through-cycle superiority and we intend to maintain that. Theresa Wagler : And then, John, I would just add if you look at the total debt level just over $2 billion and then you take into consideration the capital structure, which is perfectly laddered out where there is not anyone more material maturity in one year and that current maturities actually don\u2019t even have a meaningful maturity even at three to four years. And that\u2019s purposeful and that\u2019s we maintain what we believe to be a very conservative balance sheet, but appropriate for a growth company. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments. Mark Millett : So, thank you. And for those still on the call, I\u2019d like to thank you for your time today. And those that supports us, thank you for your support. To our employees, again, our priority is safety, safety, safety. Please be safe in anything that you do and thank you for all you do for our company. And also, thank you to loyal customers for your support as well. Without you, we wouldn't be who we are. So thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. As always, we appreciate and value your time with us this morning. But first I'd like to thank the SDI team for delivering a solid quarter, despite a challenging pricing environment and congratulate them for their continued innovative passionate spirit that continues to drive this phenomenal company toward excellence. It is gratifying to see our teams continue to break records, create new products, and find new ways to be even more productive, cost-efficient, and safe. But first, to begin the morning, Theresa will provide insights regarding our second quarter results. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning. Our second quarter 2019 net income was $194 million or $0.87 per diluted share within our guidance range of $0.86 to $0.90. Second quarter 2019 revenues were $2.8 billion, 10% lower than second quarter 2018 sales and 2% lower than the first quarter sequential results as average flat roll realized steel prices decline. Our second quarter 2019 operating income was $285 million, 43% lower than prior year second quarter earnings driven by flat-rolled steel metal margin compression and 2% lower than sequential first quarter results, primarily due to lower shipments and product pricing within our long product steel operation. To take this moment to level set, our financial results are quite strong. They're just lower relative to our record high 2018 results. And as we discuss our business this morning, you'll find we are constructive concerning underlying steel demand and optimistic concerning our unique earnings catalog. Within our steel operations, second quarter shipments increased 3% sequentially to 2.8 million tons, a result of the continued ramp-up of our Heartland facility and the recent addition of United Steel Supply. Our average quarterly realized steel sales prices across all operations decreased $23 per ton to $879 in the second quarter. However, if you exclude our steel processing location sales, the average sales price for our steel mills declined $41 per ton as averaged scrap cost only declined $22 compressing our steel metal margin. The result was second quarter steel operating income of $295 million and although lower than prior year results, historically, a very good performance. I want to take a moment to mention additional information we provided related to our steel production volumes versus our steel processing volumes. It's important to note the change in our steel mix from almost purely steel production economics to the higher percentage of steel processing or conversion economics that we have today. We posted our second quarter slide deck on our website. And if you review slide eight, you will note that the mix shift changes how you should view our steel operating cost. We still maintain the lowest and the most highly variable conversion cost position, but we now have a larger component of our costs related to raw material steel with input used at our steel processing location. For example, the process steel input was only 10% of our steel platform cost of goods sold in 2017, and has grown to 16% year-to-date in 2019 and will likely increase further as we continue to grow volume at both Heartland and United Steel Supply. It's a powerful strategic advantage to have processing capabilities with the same higher steel mill utilization during weaker demand environment, create optionality of supply for our customers, and allow for value-add product diversified in all market. Moving to our metals recycling platform. Second quarter operating income was $11 million, a 47% decrease sequentially based on lower ferrous selling values and lower non-ferrous shipment. Indexed ferrous scrap prices fell and was $90 per gross ton from March to June 2019. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model which benefits both the steel mills and the scrap operations. Second quarter 2019 operating income for our fabrication business improved sequentially to $31 million, representing a 49% increase and our third best quarterly performance. Congratulations to the team. Earnings improved based on strong shipments and meaningfully lower steel input cost. We continue to see strong order inquiry and customer optimism coupled with a strong project backlog. Our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong. During the second quarter 2019, we generated $361 million of cash flow from operations and $543 million for the first half of 2019. This incredible performance represents a trailing 12-month 85% free cash flow conversion rate. First half 2019 capital investments were $140 million. We estimate second half 2019 fixed assets capital investments to be approximately $150 million. We still have about $80 million to spend on Columbus' third galvanizing line which is on schedule to start mid-2020. We maintained our cash dividend for the second quarter at $0.24 per common share. We also repurchased $93 million of our common stock during the second quarter and $177 million during the first half of the year. Just over $220 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Since June of 2016 we have repurchased 24.3 million shares, representing 11% of our outstanding balance.  We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We achieved record liquidity of over $2.3 billion at June 30, 2019, representing $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.2 billion of available funding under our revolving credit facility. Before I hand the call back to Mark, I'll share some updates pertaining to the anticipated cash investment timelines for our new Southwestern U.S. flat roll steel mill to be located in Sinton, Texas.  The total investment is currently expected to be approximately $1.9 billion, based on an expanded project scope to accommodate the differentiated 84-inch width and associated coil handling requirements. We also increased the galvanizing line from 450,000 tons to 550,000 tons. Assuming timely receipt of required environmental and operating permits, we expect to begin facility construction early 2020, followed by starting operations midyear of 2021. Based on this timeline, we estimate capital outlays to be approximately $275 million in 2019, $1 billion in 2020 with the remainder in 2021. In 2019 so far we've spent approximately $30 million. These estimates do not include state and local incentive benefits. The strength of our through-cycle cash generation coupled with a strong capital foundation provides meaningful opportunity for growth and the continued shareholder distribution through our positive dividend profile and share repurchase program. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. And lastly for those that track in more detail our flat roll shipments, during the second quarter we shipped 856,000 tons of hot-rolled and P&O, 191,000 tons of cold-rolled and 950,000 tons of coated material. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. Safety is and will always be our number one value and first priority. There's nothing more important. While our performance remains significantly better than industry averages, it's clearly not enough. It's not good enough. We must all remain vigilant both at work and at home, to be continuously aware of our surroundings and those around us. I challenge all of us to remain focused and strive toward our ultimate goal of zero incidents. The fabrication platform delivered a strong performance, with earnings increasing almost 50%. Despite continued wet weather hindering the pace of construction projects, volumes increased based on a steady underlying demand environment. Profit margins also expanded as raw material steel input costs decreased meaningfully. Our order backlog remained strong to slightly ahead of where we were at this time last year. Project backlogs are expanding as contractors struggle with the construction labor shortage, which should prolong this non-residential construction cycle. The ongoing strength of this business and continued customer optimism bodes well for non-residential construction demand well into next year. Ferrous scrap pricing trended down through the quarter, with both prime and obsolete scrap indices falling almost $90 per gross ton in three months. Our metals recycling profitability decreased as a result of the lower ferrous selling values and lower non-ferrous shipments. Scrap pricing appears to have stabilized in July. Scrap flows began to slow later in the quarter and manifested by lower procurement values thereby reducing dealer and the odd inventories, and export volumes remain weak. Although muted, we would expect some firming of the scrap price over the next four to eight weeks by perhaps $20 a ton. The manufacturing base is still generating an ample supply of prime scrap. We anticipate export volumes to remain constrained throughout the rest of the year. So this is consistent with our longer-term scrap view that pricing will remain stable and supportive of healthy steel metal margins into next year. The steel platform delivered a solid second quarter performance in a challenging steel pricing environment, a weakening scrap environment coupled with continued inventory destocking that the steel buying hesitancy throughout the quarter. Hot-roll coil price indices have fallen approximately $200 per ton since December 2018. Despite these challenges, with the addition of United Steel Supply and the ramp-up of Heartland steel, our steel shipment volume improved. The good news is that underlying steel demand has remained intact, scrap prices have steadied, and we have recently seen stabilization and improvement in flat roll pricing resulting in increased order activity and improved backlogs across the Flat Roll platform. In contrast structural, merchant bar and rebar steel pricing remains pressured from domestic and imported competition. Underlying domestic steel demand remains constructive, and we've seen continued positive activity across most of the steel-consuming sectors, including the automotive, construction and industrial customers. Energy is particularly strong and with the necessary growth in transportation, pipeline and infrastructure for both gas and liquids, will remain strong for several years to come. We believe both the U.S. and Mexican steel consumption will continue to improve in the coming years with Mexican growth outpacing that of the U.S. based on meaningful increases in their manufacturing base. Furthermore, the U.S. trade position should continue to erode imports and increase domestic steel content requirements of the anticipated USMCA, which has recently been approved by Mexico and is in the process of approval by Canada, should enhance domestic demand and further support industry utilization. We continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future through optimization of existing operations, organic investments and transactional growth. During 2018, we reinvested in our existing steel operations and acquired Heartland. Early this year, we also acquired a 75% controlling interest in United Steel Supply to further enhance our pre-paint supply chain. We completed a $38 million 200,000 ton rebar expansion at our Roanoke Bar Division in the third quarter of 2018, becoming the only independent supplier in the area. In the first half of 2019, the team achieved close to 75% volume rate capability. In the first quarter of 2019, we also completed a 240,000-ton $82 million rebar expansion in our Structural and Rail division. Ramp-up here has been a little slower than anticipated but the key piece of equipment is now commissioned and we expect to achieve a 75% production rate later in the second half 2019. This expansion includes cut-to-length and coiled rebar capability. Our unique rebar supply chain model is expected to meaningfully enhance customer optionality and flexibility providing significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits for the customer. In addition, we will be the largest independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region. We acquired Heartland mid-year of 2018, increasing our flat roll product diversification through value-added wider and lighter gauge product capability. Its geographic proximity to our existing Midwest flat roll operations also allows for meaningful value creation. Butler has been enhanced in its production capability by redirecting lighter gauge orders to Heartland allowing Butler to increase more value-added production. In fact, they have been setting production records in all their coating lines even after 25 years of continued growth. It's attributed to their innovative passionate spirit and I congratulate both teams for their continued commitment and never-fearing can-do attitude. We plan to reach approximately 70% of the planned 800,000-ton run rate for Heartland in the second half of 2019. In 2018, we also announced further growth for our Columbus flat roll division. In the last two years, Columbus has transformed its product offering through the addition of a paint line and the introduction of more complex grades of flat roll steel. The diversion of products to these diversified value-added outlets produced the volume of existing products available to our current galvanized steel customers. To address the associated lack of sufficient galvanizing capacity, we announced the addition of a third galvanizing line at Columbus. The $140 million investment is another step of further value-added diversification at Columbus and less hot-rolled coil exposure. The 400,000-ton line is planned to begin operating midyear 2020. Additionally, we announced a $90 million investment at Columbus to further increase the range of complex grade capabilities including the advanced high-strength steels for both the automotive and energy sectors. These upgrades will be completed by the end of 2020. In aggregate, these upgrades will reduce the availability of about 400,000 tons of non-coated flat roll steel that we currently supply into the Southern U.S. by the year 2021. This advantageously coincides with the time frame we plan to begin operating our brand new flat roll steel mill. This should be an immediate help to volume loading the new mill. And I continue to be increasingly excited about the expansive opportunities and the long-term value creation of our Southwest U.S. and Mexico growth strategy will provide Steel Dynamics. Each of our operating platforms have an existing presence in the region today and we're on the move and planning to meaningfully expand our influence in the region. The planned construction of our new flat roll steel mill is a significant part of that plan. The facility is designed to have an annual production capacity of 3 million tons and will include a 550,000-ton galvanizing line and a 250,000-ton paint line Galvalume capability. We estimate the investment to be approximately $1.9 billion. We've entered into equipment supply agreements in most of the items we estimate to being the primary supplier. The new mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc-furnace flat roll steel reducers competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. Having a thicker cast section and more conventional two-stage hot rolling process that allows thermal mechanical rolling, the metal capability will provide higher strength tougher grades for the energy and automotive markets. The mill will be capable of 84-inch wide, one inch thick, 100 ksi hot-rolled coil. The capability essentially unavailable in the U.S. today. Furthermore, heavier coil weights and heat size will provide energy pipe producers, intrinsic cost and yield saving. The configuration will also allow us to ship some by-products on a limited basis. Downstream value-added capabilities will include as I said galvanizing improvement. To be clear, we're not just adding production capacity. We have a differentiated product portfolio. We will have a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and we have targeted customer markets. As you saw, we are happy and excited to announce the new mill will be located in Sinton Texas. Adjacent to Corpus Christi, the geographic location has numerous significant competitive advantages to almost any site along the Gulf Coast, when considering geographic market position, power, freight benefits and what became increasingly significant in the site search, water availability and constructability. The people in Sinton have been very welcoming and we thank them for their partnership and shared vision for this strategic investment. Significant competitive advantage lies in the Sinton location and central to our targeted customer in the market regions. Sinton lies just 190 miles from the large steel-consuming city of Houston and 300 miles from the growing Monterrey, Mexico region. It also provides advantageous capability to access the West Coast. The site will provide a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers, relative to their current supply chain configuration. We would expect the sales to be a minimum of $20 to $30 per ton compared to their current closest domestic supplier. In addition, customers will be able to order on a much shorter lead time basis, providing a significant delivery time and working capital advantage. We have the opportunity to provide steel in terms of weeks, not months. These benefits provide a competitive supply chain, allowing the new mill to effectively compete with imports thrown into Houston and the West Coast that inherently have long lead times and suspected of pricing risks. This will give the American pipe producers the competitive supply chain to once again compete with foreign pipe producers that have dominated the market as of late. Consider that approximately 2.4 million tons of OCTG and 1.5 million tons of line pipe were imported through the port of Houston in 2018. Customers are excited to have a regional supplier and have already expressed interest in possibly locating facilities on or near our site, and we're in currently in dialogue with many of them today. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico, due to our scrap management relationships, much of which is prime scrap. We also plan to cost-effectively source pig iron through the port system. Based on our current scrap relationships, both in Mexico and the Southern U.S., we are confident in the ability to procure a high-quality prime scrap in the region. We have three targeted regional sales markets, representing over 27 to 28 million tons of relevant flat-roll steel consumption, and we believe that demand will increase in the coming year. The regions include approximately 8 million tons from the four-state region of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which has limited domestic regional supply and relies heavily on imports. Sinton lies in close proximity to both rail and trucking delivery into these regions. There are approximately 4 million tons from the underserved West Coast region, which also relies heavily on imports and there are approximately 16 million tons from the growing Northern and Mid-Central Mexican region. In 2018, the Mexican market imported 7.5 million tons of flat-rolled steel. And based on their growing manufacturing base, we believe Mexican demand growth will continue to outpace supply, making it an even more attractive underserved market in the coming years. Sinton will have the most trade advantage shipment into this region from the U.S. We've been developing our flat-rolled steel business strategy for this region in Mexico for several years. We've been developing both customer and scrap relationships and we are confident in the long-term strategic value and investment profile this project provides. We believe our unique operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost-effective and highly profitable steel mills, positions us well to execute this greenfield opportunity. More generally, we are also optimistic about our existing market opportunities for 2019. For the second half of 2019, we believe, North American steel consumption will experience continued modest growth, supported by further steel import reductions and the end of inventory destocking. The actions taken by the U.S. federal government have developed a healthy domestic steel industry and should provide sustainable long-term support to the U.S. manufacturing base. There have been recent allied steel convention trade actions that we believe could have a positive impact in further reducing unfairly traded steel imports into the United States, including coated flat-rolled steel, which could have a significant positive impact to Steel Dynamics, as we are the largest non-automotive flat-rolled steel coater in the U.S. Additionally, we're already seeing a benefit from trade action against prefabricated steel imports that have gained significant market share over the last few years. Specific to Steel Dynamics, our unique culture and the execution of the long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through a strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, clearly demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Customer focus, coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, support our ability to maintain our best-in-class performance and differentiation. The company and team are poised for continued organic and transactional growth, and that team is exceptional and provides the foundation for our success. I thank each and every one of you for your passion and commitment to our excellence and remind you safety is always the first priority. We're committed to providing exemplary long-term value to our fellow colleagues, communities, customers and shareholders and look forward to creating new opportunities. So, again, thank you for your time, and Christine, we'd love to turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Terry : Hi, Mark, and thanks for taking my question. Just around the new mills, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the incentives, how they play out and over what time line and the sort of things the discussions you had on that side. And then, around the galvanizing just on the CapEx side the extra 100,000 ton expansion there. Can you just talk a little bit about customer feedback, and how you came to the decision on that? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : So Chris, related to the incentives, there's approximately $150 million to $155 million worth of incentives. Some of that probably 10% to 15% of that would be more in the immediate time frame over the two to three-year time frame. The rest of it is a little bit longer on half of the property taxes, so more of a 10-year time frame. And we'll be getting more specific with that as time goes on. Mark Millett : It is in -- relative to the galvanizing expanded volumes, I think we said 450,000 tons in the past to 550,000 tons. Obviously, our past commentary was way before the real detailed conversations with equipment suppliers, and also just internal debate with design -- with our own talent, and we just believe that 550,000 tons for the anticipated line is reality for that line, and certainly going to be absorbed by the market play. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Korn : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. So we spent so many months watching sheet prices fall and focusing on supply ramp-ups. It's exciting to see prices start to gain some traction and some bullishness appear in the scrap markets. Now back in February, it looked like the market had also had a little bit of a turn. You saw favorable seasonality anticipated, iron ores is popped in, some price hikes were announced. But that turned out to be a head fake. So, a question for you is, what do you think is different this time around with where we are in the cycle? Mark Millett : Well, I think obviously the principal pressure has been the destocking of the supply chain. And to be honest, as I talked with customers over the past six to seven months, some of them since December, people have been a little surprised in all honesty that the pricing dropped as far as it did in the first place, because underlying demand we believe and I think all our customers believe, is generally intact, and as we said it\u2019s very, very constructive. So, you're seeing a couple of sort of boiled down the price increases. I think you probably saw the public price increased again -- the additional price increase again yesterday. The indices have come up to around about $550-ish today from a low of $505 in June. The future -- September future is around the $605. I do believe that the recent price increases will certainly achieve, if not exceed, that future level. Matthew Korn : Got it. Then let me ask on the new site in Texas. So, first, in terms of timing of permitting your final incentives, when should we see that all summed up and cleared for construction? And then, second, with the aim for the mid-2021 operations just to start up? How active are you and can you be today in actually building out the book of business? Do you have a target in terms of how much you expect to be under a firm contract? How much you'd earmark for on-site buyers as you described? Any detail there and the strategy would be very helpful. Mark Millett : Okay. Well, firstly, we would anticipate obviously firms' on-site work occurring later this year, but true construction not occurring until early next year after a permit has been put in place. We're expecting technically that we'd get a permit first quarter of 2020, give or take a little bit. And relative to the market for Butler, I think, if I could kind of expand a little bit on that, there's been some criticism lately that, I guess, as to the expansionary plans of the -- in general. I just want to clearly sort of state that this project, this opportunity is really differentiated. It certainly brings a combination of technologies and dimensional capabilities that is unsurpassed and largely unavailable in the U.S. today, that the energy pipe producers -- a lot of material through a necessity is being imported, because we just don't have the quality and capability within the United States. So I would tell you that the mill isn't just adding domestic capacity. It's more of an import killer. The substantial amount of material flowing through the Port of Houston. And it's going to allow the pipe producers in the area for the first time in a long time a competitive supplier of scrap or hot-rolled coil to compete with the Korean and other pipe importers. And as I said earlier, there's about -- in 2018, there's about 2.4 million tons of OCTG and about 1.5 million tons of land pipe came in, competing with our American pipe producers. That's because they just have -- they didn't have a substrate to use, competitively priced substrate. We think that we're going to compete admirably, to be honest, on the import side of the business. As I suggested, the rearrangement or redirection of the product of Columbus is going to essentially eliminate our ability to supply about 400,000 tons of hot-rolled coil products into Texas. That will coincide with the start-up of the mill, so there's kind of an immediate base loading just from our current product mix. We have a growing automotive volume into Mexico, especially through the BMW and other European providers through U.S. Steel Supply. I think we have an immediate growth opportunity for more pre-painted Galvalume. There's roughly -- there's about 250,000 and 300,000 tons of Galvalume that came through the Port of Houston last year. And obviously, we'll be able to compete to that. And then, finally, we have had considerable and, I think, there are actually more than considerable, incredible amount of interest from our customer base. Those in the industry are incredibly excited to have a regional producer in that area and we have numerous steel consumers, both pipe producers, steel service centers, distributors, processors wanting to locate or co-locate in that region. And I would imagine that we can achieve very, very quickly the same model as we have in Butler where I think we have 500,000, 600,000 tons of sort of on-campus consumption. So, I'm confident that we can ramp-up the mill very, very quickly. Matthew Korn : Got it. Good luck to you Mark. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : Yes, hey, good morning, guys. Mark Millett : Good morning. Timna Tanners : On Nucor's call, they talked a little bit about third quarter being affected by the sharp decline in price in the second quarter on a lag basis to contract customers. So, I was wondering if you could expand on how that can affect your operations and that if you've either seen the same phenomenon? Theresa Wagler : Timna, yes. As a reminder to everyone for the Flat Roll Group, we have about 50% of our volume that's contractual and so it will have the lag effect as well. It's tied in some form or fashion with CRU Index. So, we'll have that same phenomenon that Nucor mentioned on their call. Timna Tanners : Okay. And it would be the interesting to hear if there's other facets that could offset that especially because you've been expanding more to downstream but I wanted to ask my second question on the new mill. Just wondering if you could expand on a few things. One is you say incredibly quick ramp-up which it sounds like, but when you talk about middle of 2021, when would you expect to get to a full run rate? And at what point would that convert to from hot roll to including more of a galvanized like how quickly can you expand on your value add paint line et cetera? And how much could be plate, because that was intriguing with the capability to go up to 5.5 inches. Thanks. Mark Millett : I'll take the plate one first before I forget. The 5.5 inches, it's the cast section we're going with a much thicker section than any other electric-arc-furnace space mill in The States today if not the world to be honest. And that allows you to do sort of metallurgical things, thermal mechanical rolling, greater reductions to have better surfaces. The actual finished product maximum thickness is 1-inch, so 1-inch hot-rolled coil. So, it's not 5.5-inch plate. Timna Tanners : Got you. Okay. Mark Millett : So, it's the 1-inch coil plate that we could process or have processed into sort of cut-to-length then plate. And maybe if you look at the plate market there's an 84-inch range. We should be able to supply 100,000 tons, 200,000 tons of plate I would think at least one would hope. On the ramp-up, again, starting up in mid-2021, I would hope to be in 2022 around about 75% 80% of its rated capacity. And then relative to the value add given that we have hot-rolled coil substrate available at Columbus throughout our organization, we will attempt to accelerate the galvanizing line and pre-paint line and that -- Glenn's want to fringe, but I would imagine that's going to be the first half of 2021 as a start-up. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Fields : Hey everybody. I just wanted to ask a probably more boring question on the balance sheet here. But you've basically been at about $2.4 billion of debt for the last two and a half years. Heading into especially next year where you're going to ramp-up the capital spending, is $2.4 billion kind of the right level of dollar amount of debt for your balance sheet? Or do you think that there is a lower or higher level that you're more comfortable with? Theresa Wagler : Yes. No. We absolutely have more debt capacity for the balance sheet as we execute on both organic and potential transactional opportunity. You'll see it utilize the balance sheet in that way when it's necessary. So, there's still room. Matthew Fields : Okay. So, does that mean that investment-grade rating is a little bit less important than it was in the past if you're willing to borrow more on the balance sheet to fund these growth opportunities? Theresa Wagler : I wouldn't say that because today our metrics are actually far superior to just entry level investment-grade metrics. So there's still room to have that on the balance sheet and have investment grade ratings as well. But that's something that will happen when the time comes. Matthew Fields : Okay. But the focus is on the new Southwest mill and then potentially other M&A opportunities for the shorter term. Theresa Wagler : Correct. Matthew Fields : Okay. Thanks very much and good luck. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi Investment Research. Please proceed with your question. Alex Hacking : Hi, good morning. Thanks Mark and Theresa. I just wanted to follow up on the Texas mill quickly. If I synthesize what I think you said Mark, just looking at the U.S. piece of this mill which is going to be about 2 million tons of supply or 70% heading for Texas-West Coast which in your view is about an 11 million-ton market. You said 400,000 tons will substitute Butler, 30% is targeted for energy which is largely going to displace imports something like 600,000 tons that's about 1 million tons. Of the other million tons that the mill is going to sell, do you have a sense of what the opportunity is to displace imports of that versus how much will be taken up with market growth and displacing other domestic supply? Mark Millett : Let's try, our color really matter, but I believe other areas would be the --the prepaint Galvalume that's been a market that has been highly pressured by imports particularly Vietnam and that iron circumvention action here recently was certainly holding that the rest of 250,000 tons of new product in that area. You have directly about 1 million tons down to Mexico through automotive HVAC and appliance. Now that's today a 15 million ton, 16 million ton market about 7.5 million tons are currently imported. And even with the increased capacity announcements there, that market is kind of dislocated, but they just don't have the product capabilities for the [indiscernible] today. So even with their internal expansions, we see considerable opportunity of the years ahead for that one million tons. Alex Hacking : Okay, thanks. And then just following up on the current market conditions, you mentioned as Nucor and others have done that we're seeing kind of a destocking for the industrial supply chain. Do you guys have any sense about when that destocking and as you talked to your customers, did you get any sense that it's already ending in June versus what you are seeing in April and May? Thanks. Mark Millett : I guess one has to assume that it's coming to an end because the customers are back in the marketplace as pricing is appreciating today, the order activity input rates are increasing and lead times are extending. And if you consider that with the destocking imports will continue to erode for the rest of the year and we believe the second half demand will be modestly above into the beginning half of the year. So I think that will pressure the market into upward price momentum and increased order rate. Alex Hacking : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Hey, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Mark what are you seeing on the consumable side? I know that electrodes and refractories and alloys have been pressure points over the last 12 to 18 months. But are we seeing any reprieve and any of those inputs? Mark Millett : I think the -- any one of the significance or materiality would be electrodes Phil. And as Barry laids out... Barry Schneider : 20%, 25%. Mark Millett : 20%, 25%? So that's the... Barry Schneider : From the peak. Mark Millett : From the peak. And obviously, there is the contracted volume, so that doesn't happen overnight, but it happens through the rest of this year. So that's a positive move. I don't think we're seeing any major issues with alloys or refractories or on the outside so... Phil Gibbs : Well, Mark, when you talk about electrodes being down I guess from peak or on the spot side, I know there's some contract commitments at least in the U.S. market. So how does that all blend together in terms of what you all actually realize? Theresa Wagler : There's -- with the electrodes, if you look at the cost side that we did in the presentation, you can see that they moved kind of from 2017, 2018 levels of about 1% of our cost to about 2%. Year-to-date, they're up probably around $25 million for the first half of the year compared to the first half of last year. Phil Gibbs : That's very helpful. And then just a question, as I bridge cash flow for this year. Theresa, what are you envision for working capital change in the second half? And then also please just remind us again what your CapEx guidance is for this year? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : So the CapEx guidance for the second half of this year excluding the new mill is about $150 million. For the new mill, we're expecting to spend approximately $275 million in 2019. And as it relates to working capital, I would expect it to not likely be drawn in the second half. It's likely to be even to maybe slightly ascending as we worked on some of the within finished goods inventory that grew a bit in the second quarter. Phil Gibbs : Thank you. Theresa Wagler : You're welcome. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you, Christine. Once again, thank you everyone that is remaining on the call. Thank you for your time today. It continues to be an incredibly exciting time for SDI. We've had a very positive growth curve over the last 25 years and I believe with Heartland, with U.S. Steel Supply and now with the New Mill, we will continue to maintain if not exceed that trajectory. And just want to thank our customers for allowing us to do that and for our employees, thank you seriously for everything you do each and every day and continue to work safe. Thank you all. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call, and we certainly appreciate you spending some time with us this morning. I'd like to thank the SDI team for delivering a solid quarter despite a challenging steel pricing environment. Their dedication, their drive and innovative spirit continues to propel us toward excellence that earn superior financial metrics and shareholder value. I'd like to thank each and every one of our 8,000 team for their input. But to begin this morning, Theresa will provide insights into our third quarter performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2019 net income was $151 million or $0.69 per diluted share, within our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.70 per diluted share. Third quarter 2019 revenues were $2.5 billion, 22% lower than the third quarter 2018 sales and 9% lower than sequential second quarter results as average realized steel prices declined. Our third quarter 2019 operating income was $228 million, 57% lower than the prior year record-high third quarter results and 20% lower than sequential second quarter earnings due to lower realized flat roll steel pricing, which more than offset the benefit of lower scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find we are constructive concerning underlying steel demand and optimistic concerning our own unique earnings catalysts. Within our steel operations, third quarter shipments declined modestly 2% to 2.7 million tons. Our average quarterly realized external steel sales price decreased $70 per ton to $809 in the third quarter, and average scrap cost only declined $41 per ton, causing lower steel metal margins. The result of third quarter steel operating income was $240 million, and although lower than record-high prior year results, historically a very good performance. As I mentioned on last quarter's call, I want to take a moment to point out the continued mix shift of steel processing volume versus steel production volume. It's important to note the change in our steel mix from almost purely steel production economics to the higher percentage of steel processing or conversion economics that we have today. We maintain a low and highly variable operating cost position, in fact, we would say best in class. But we now have a larger component of cost related to the raw material from the input used in our steel processing locations. It's a powerful strategic advantage to have processing capability to sustain higher steel mill utilization during weaker demand environments to create optionality and supply for our customers and to allow for value-added product upside in all markets. For our metals recycling platform, third quarter operating income was $3 million, over a 70% decline sequentially primarily related to our non-ferrous operations as aluminum and copper demand continued to weaken. Ferrous shipments and selling values also were lower in the quarter with prime scrap indices falling almost $30 per gross ton in July to September. Approximately 65% of our non-recycling ferrous shipments serve our own steel mills, increasing scrap quality, melt efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital requirement. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Third quarter 2019 operating income for our fabrication business improved sequentially to $35 million, our second best quarterly performance. Congratulations to the team. Earnings improved based on near-record shipments and lower steel input costs. We continue to see strong order [Audio Gap] customer optimism coupled with a seasonally strong project backlog. Our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong. During the third quarter of 2019, we generated $444 million of cash flow from operations and $987 million during the first 9 months of the year. This performance represents a trailing 12-months free cash flow of $1.2 billion equating to a cash flow conversion rate of 13%. Year-to-date, 2019 capital investments totaled $294 million, over half of which occurred in the third quarter as spending related to our new Sinton flat roll steel mill started. We maintained our cash dividend in the third quarter at $0.24 per common share. We also repurchased $115 million of our common stock during the third quarter, totaling $292 million in the first 9 months of 2010, with $170 million remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Since 2016, we've repurchased 30.8 million shares representing 13% of our outstanding balance. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We achieved record liquidity of $2.4 billion at September 30, 2019, representing $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and an equal amount of available funding under our revolving credit facility. Regarding our new Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill, the total investment remains an estimated $1.9 billion. Assuming timely receipt of required environmental and operating permits, we expect to begin facility construction early in 2020 followed by starting operations midyear 2021. Based on this time line, we estimate capital outlay to be approximately $225 million in 2019, of which we've already spent this year close to $120 million; approximately $1.2 billion in 2020; with the remainder in 2021. We've also been awarded state and local incentive benefits that will be received over time approximating $150 million to $155 million. Collectively, our primary strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through-cycle historical spread basis. You'll find this specifically outlined in our slide deck on Slide 9. The estimate includes our planned Sinton, Texas steel mill and third Columbus galvanizing line as well as our 2 existing rebar expansions which are still in a ramp-up phase. Last week, we also received updates to our credit ratings. We are pleased with our new investment-grade credit status achieved with the 3 rating agencies. This is a natural progression of our strategic growth and recognition of our strong balance sheet profile and sustainable through-cycle free cash flow generation capability. Due to the strength and optionality within our capital structure and free cash flow-generating business model, we have the flexibility for continued growth and responsible shareholder distribution while also being dedicated to preserving investment-grade credit rating. We are committed to maintaining net leverage at 2x or less on a through-cycle basis. Our capital allocation still prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distribution comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Before I send the call back to Mark, for those of you that like to have the breakdown of our flat roll shipments, in the third quarter we had shipments of 800,000 tons of hot roll and P&O. We had 197,000 tons of cold roll, and we had 958,000 tons of coated products. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Well, thank you, Theresa. Safety is and always will be our #1 value, our very, very first priority. Our safety performance year-to-date is generally in line with our excellent 2018 performance and the severity rate continues to decrease as the leading metric in our industry. While performance remained significantly better than industrial averages, it certainly is not enough though. We must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members around us. Safety must always be top of mind and I challenge all of us to remain focused in the key movement toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries. As Theresa suggested, the fabrication platform delivered an outstanding performance with the team achieving near-record earnings in shipments. Profit margins expanded as raw material steel input costs continued to decline and underlying demand fundamentals remained steady. Our order backlog remained seasonally strong. Our customers remained positive regarding demand volume for 2020 despite the recent weakness in the ABI the last few months. Demand from the institutional and residential sectors has been outperforming the commercial construction sector with more domestic activity in the western and southern regions. The total availability of construction labor and projects have been somewhat delayed and will effectively extend this construction cycle. This year has been particularly difficult in the metals recycling world. Not only have ferrous scrap prices declined 8 of the last 10 months, but the combination of trade and uncertainty around some of China's environmental policies have also pressured non-ferrous demand and prices. Despite the team's continued focus on efficiency gains, our metals recycling numbers decreased in the quarter, primarily a result of the continued decline of aluminum and copper demand and associated selling values. Given that we're at the last few cycles of non-ferrous metals in the U.S., it has significant effect to the recycling platform lines. Ferrous scrap shipments declined with no utilization growth and inventories have gone down in anticipation of steel mill meeting the [indiscernible]. Concurrently, selling values also declined in the quarter due to diminished demand and lack of export market. The GM strike contributed to decreased ferrous demand from our foundry customers as well as molten aluminum from our superior alloys division. Price scrap generation from GM and its suppliers has reduced price flat flow but had -- should have only marginal impact in the months ahead. After October's saw the trend down in ferrous scrap prices, we anticipate scrap prices to stabilize moving into the winter months. The steel platform performed well in a challenging environment, with continued weakening in scrap prices and reduced customer buying hesitancy in anticipation of further steel price declines compared to the second quarter and third quarter hot-rolled coil price indices at almost $80 per ton. Long products pricing remains pressured from domestic and import competition. However, we're seeing the benefits from our recent investments in product and supply chain differentiation helping to offset some of these market pressures. Underlying domestic steel demand appears principally intact in the prime steel consumer sectors, including automotive and construction. Steel consumed for the pipeline infrastructure for the collection and distribution of fracked natural gas and liquids continues to be strong, and we expect it to remain so as the U.S. continues its energy independence journey. We believe North American steel consumption will improve in the coming years, with maximum growth outpacing that of the U.S. based on meaningful increases in Mexico's manufacturing base. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. trade decision will continue to erode imports, and the increased domestic steel content requirements for the automotive industry currently included in the anticipated USMCA should enhance domestic steel demand. However, global economic concerns and ongoing trade negotiations are certainly creating a negative atmosphere and buyers remain extremely cautious. We continue to competitively position Steel Dynamics for the future through optimization of existing operations, organic investments and transactional growth. During the last 12 months, we acquired Heartland, invested $300 million in our steel platform, and early this year, acquired 75% controlling interest in United Steel Supply to further enhance our prepainted flat roll steel distribution network. Specifically, we are ramping up our 200,000 ton rebar expansion in our Roanoke Bar Division. We're the only independent supplier in the region. The line has ramped up towards 8% reliance rate capability. In the first quarter of 2019, we also completed the 240,000 ton rebar expansion in our Structural and Rail division. The ramp-up has been slower than planned and it's currently running at approximately a 50% rate. With the startup behind us, we fully expect to be at full capacity next year. This expansion includes cut-to-length and coil rebar capability. This unique rebar supply chain model is expected to meaningfully enhance customer optionality and flexibility, providing significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits for the customer. In addition, we will be the largest independent rebar supplier in the Midwest region. Within the flat roll group, the acquisition of Heartland provided further product diversification through value-added wider- and lighter-gauge product capability. The team achieved record quarterly volumes which is 70% of planned 800,000 ton annual run rate. This geographic proximity to our flat roll operations allows for additional value creation. By allocating lighter-gauge production in Heartland, our Butler Flat Roll Division has increased its value-added production effort, setting new volume records. And it also creates significant pull-through volume for Butler, thereby providing additional mill utilization support through [ summer ]. We're also in the process of further value-added growth with the Columbus Flat Roll division. In the last 2 years, Columbus has transformed its product offering through the addition of a paint line and an introduction of more complex grades of flat roll steel. The diversion of the product to these diversified and value-added outlets has reduced the volume of product available to our existing galvanized steel customers. So to address the associated lack of sufficient galvanizing capacity, we are building a third galvanizing line at Columbus. The $140 million investment will further increase Columbus' value-added capability, decreasing its hot-rolled coil exposure. The 400,000 ton line is planned to begin operating in midyear 2020. Additionally, we are investing approximately $90 million to further increase Columbus' range of complex-grade capabilities, including advanced high-strength steels for both the automotive and energy sectors. These upgrades are occurring in the coming months with planned completion by the end of 2020. In aggregate, these upgrades will effectively reduce the availability of about 400,000 tons of Columbus' non-coated flat roll steel that is currently shipped to the Southern U.S. by 2021. This advantageously coincides with the startup of our new Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill and will provide immediate support in the new year. Our Southwest U.S. and Mexico growth strategy will provide expansive opportunities and long-term value creation to Steel Dynamics. Each of our operating platforms have an existing presence in the region, where we plan to meaningfully expand our influence there. At the core is the construction and startup of our new Sinton, Southwest U.S. flat roll division. We have purchased the land, the equipment is ordered and most of the service agreements have been negotiated, and we've already [ expelled the landlord ]. We have assembled a team of our veterans having incredible depth of experience in the construction side and operation of large steel assets, and they're already executing extremely well. The facility is designed with an annual production capacity of 2 million tons, will include a 550,000 ton galvanizing line and a 250,000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability.  The new mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc-furnace flat-rolled steel producers, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The mill will have the capabilities to provide higher strength, tougher grades of flat roll steel for the energy and automotive markets. This is due to having a thicker cast section and a more conventional 2-stage hot rolling process which allows for thermal mechanical rolling. The mill will be capable of 84-inch wide, 1-inch thick, 100 ksi of hot roll coil, product unavailable in the United States today. Additionally, heavier coil weights and heat size will provide energy pipe producers intrinsic cost and yield savings. The configuration will also allow us to ship certain plate products on a limited basis, providing further product diversification. The steel mill site, as advertised, is located in Sinton, Texas, which is adjacent to Corpus Christi. The site has numerous significant competitive advantages compared to almost any other location along the Gulf Coast, including geographic market position, power accessibility, freight benefits, water availability and constructability. The people of Sinton have been very welcoming, and we thank them for their partnership and shared vision for this strategic investment.  A significant competitive advantage lies purely in the Sinton location given it's central to our targeted market regions. Sinton lies 190 miles from the large steel-consuming city of Houston and 300 miles from the growing Monterrey, Mexico region. It also provides an advantageous capability to access the West Coast. The site will provide significant trade benefits to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain. We would expect the savings to be minimum of $20 to $30 per ton compared to their current closest domestic supplier. In addition, customers will be able to order on much shorter lead time basis, providing significant delivery time and working capital advantage. We have the opportunity to provide steel in terms of weeks versus months. These benefits provide a competitive supply chain, allowing our new mill to effectively compete with imports flying into Houston and the West Coast that inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. This will give the American pipe producers the competitive supply chain to once again compete with foreign pipe producers that have dominated the markets. Customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We're also having a dialogue with many of them who have expressed interest in locating facilities on or near our site. From a raw materials perspective, our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through our scrap management relationships, much of which is prime scrap. We also plan to cost-effectively source pig iron through the port system. Based on our current scrap relationships, both in Mexico and the Southern U.S., we are confident in our ability to procure high-quality scrap in the region. We have 3 targeted regional sales markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-roll steel consumption, and we believe this will increase in the coming years. The regions represent approximately 8 million tons from the 4-state region of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which has limited domestic regional supply and relies heavily on imports. Sinton lies in close proximity from both rail and truck deliveries in this region. Approximately 4 million ton of consumption from the underserved West Coast region, which also relies heavily on imports; and approximately 16 million tons from the growing Northern and Mid-Central Mexican regions. In 2018, the Mexican market imported 7.5 million tons of flat roll steel. And given their growing manufacturing base, we believe Mexican demand growth will continue to outpace supply, making this an even more attractive underserved market in the coming years. Sinton will have the most trade advantaged shipments into this region from the U.S. We've been developing a flat-rolled steel strategy for these regions in Mexico for several years. We've been cultivating both customer scrap relationships, and we are confident in the long-term strategic value and investment profile this project provides. We believe our unique operating culture, coupled with considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost-effective and highly profitable steel mills positions us well to execute this strategic initiative. To be clear, we're not just adding conversion capacity, we have a differentiated product portfolio, we have a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and we have targeted regional markets. In conclusion, I echo Theresa's earlier comments regarding our investment-grade achievement. This milestone recognizes our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy. We'll continue to strengthen our financial position and long-term value creation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Our exceptional team provides the foundation for our success. And I thank each and every one of you for your passion and commitment to excellence and remind each and every one of us that safety is always our first priority. We're committed to providing exemplary long-term value to our fellow colleagues, communities, customers and shareholders, and I look forward to creating new opportunities for all. So again, thank you for your time. Michelle, could you please open up the call for questions now? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies. Martin Englert : Since 232 and related retaliatory tariffs were removed within NAFTA, are you seeing any notable changes in trade flows? More specifically, is there any greater export opportunity to Mexico today? Mark Millett : I'm not sure that there's greater capability. We continue to gain market share into Mexico. So we're not seeing any resistance for sure. Martin Englert : Okay. I imagine it's probably a little bit easier to move material into Mexico versus with the tariffs in place, yes? Mark Millett : That's a yes. Martin Englert : Okay. And then if I could, one other one there. Can you provide a brief update on the SBQ market, where you're seeing demand trend year-on-year and incrementally in today's market as well as some of the trade dynamics there and competition from North American peers there? Mark Millett : So I think the -- by sort of product sector, automotive remains very, very strong. The energy sector has come off, but that is mainly from seamless sort of pipe consumers, and that's more [ dairy involved ]. I would suggest that the pipe production side of things for the entity, yes the collection and distribution infrastructure on flat roll, that remains very strong. But we are seeing some weakness in energy, fuel is then off. Several of the industrial manufacturing, trailer and those sorts of things are off a little bit on the manufacturing side of the house. Martin Englert : Okay. And if you had to guess from a manufacturing and truck trailer side of things, how much do you think demand might be trending off versus a year ago, say? Unknown Executive : Well, I think the one comment would be that the disruption which we've experienced over the last 5, 6 years has been mitigated in 2019 so we see a normalization of that market. There's been quite a lot of catch up in the last few years, and we're just seeing that level off. Martin Englert : Okay. Thanks for the incremental color there. That's helpful. Nice job navigating a difficult market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : And I apologize if this was covered. I just didn't quite hear it if it was. In terms of a very short-term question, first of all, you did imply customer destocking appearing to subside. But I think a lot of us are seeing this recent sharp -- incremental, sharp drop in spot price quotes, and I think a lot of us are seeing some further declines in published lead times. So my question is why do you think there's this disconnect between this and the end of customer destocking in your view? Mark Millett : Well, I think that's a great question. So I would say we're not understanding it completely either. The so-called destocking, I think, is trailing off and coming to an end. So you have relatively low infill positions throughout the supply chain there. Imports have continued to erode. So I believe that given the underlying demand, for the moment, it's still strong. Construction is still very strong. Energy, pipe, very, very strong. Yes, the kind of the industrial manufacturing arena has weakened to some degree. But the underlying demand or consumption of the product remains pretty well intact through the end of the year. And I would envision that we are going to see certain support at the pricing level we see today, if not a little bit of a pickup going into the first quarter as people start coming back to the marketplace. David Gagliano : Okay. And then just a somewhat associated question. Given the drop we've seen in spot pricing, I know, obviously, Steel Dynamics has a decent amount of spot sheet exposure. And my question is at what price would Steel Dynamics start to scale it back a little bit and wait for -- kind of wait for a better day, so to speak? Mark Millett : David, scale back what? David Gagliano : Production. Mark Millett : Production? David Gagliano : Yes. Mark Millett : Currently, in general, we would rarely scale back production. Our cost position is still advantageous compared to any other producer out there. Utilization from our mills is critical to retain that cost structure. We're going to remain profitable and can remain profitable at these levels and even lower levels. So we have no intent of scaling back. Theresa Wagler : And remember, David, we have the benefit of the additional manufacturing businesses to utilize our steel as well, which is one of the key factors why, if you do enter or when we are in weaker periods, we can still keep that utilization higher to keep those costs compressed for the third-party sales as well. David Gagliano : Okay, I understand. Mark Millett : Just to add to that, if you can break that, Heartland as we say, the team there has done an absolute phenomenal job on the production side. That facility is breaking records and I think has never produced at the rates that they're producing today. So when that's up and running at full tilt, that's going to be 800,000 tons of substrate. You have Texas, similarly, 700,000, 800,000 tons of substrate that allows us to get further away from other folks as needed. So this is a -- and new milling systems have about 600,000 tons of requirements. So there's a lot of flexibility there for us to divert materials over to our own facilities to maintain that utilization rate. And as we've said in the past, steel mill assets are -- through that strong fixed cost and utilization is critical to outperform our peers. David Gagliano : Understood. I appreciate the additional thoughts there. Just one more, I just want to add my name to the list of people asking the question you get asked all the time about the Texas project. Obviously, there is quite a bit of fear in the equity market now about oversupply risks, and obviously, the stocks are reflecting some of that. So my question is are there any constraints that would prohibit Steel Dynamics from pushing that time line for the project out just a bit and instead using that free cash flow during that pause period to ramp up that buyback program or special dividend program again? Mark Millett : I would say we are firmly entrenched in pushing that project forward. I'm not sure how to articulate the investment premise and the incredible investment return that that facility is going to produce. It truly is a differentiated project. You can't get that material today in the U.S. The pipe producers are actually going offshore and bringing that in. So they'll be able to make 84-inch wide, 1-inch thick, 100 ksi materials. It's going to be just a new product and a huge advantage. The trade advantage is colossal for us and so the market penetration, we feel, will be quite rapid. And it's -- as we've described in the past, it's just a vacuum of reaching production there. So I don't see why we would even entertain the thought of slowing that down. Theresa Wagler : David, just to put a cap on that, actually, as demonstrated in the third quarter, we're actually still having a positive dividend profile as we established by increasing the dividend 20% in the first quarter of this year as well as repurchasing almost $300 million of stock during the year. And so we're actively involved in the shareholder distribution as well as being able to have a strong cash flow generation to pay for the Sinton flat roll mill through free cash flow if we would choose to do so while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. So we have the optionality and the flexibility, and frankly, the intent to do all of the above. David Gagliano : Okay, that's helpful. No doubt, there's quite a bit of underappreciated long-term value there. I was just more quizzing about the thought process regarding the timing, and I appreciate the additional color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP. Seth Rosenfeld : Seth Rosenfeld, Exane BNP. A couple of questions, if I may, on the fabrication business, please. Your prepared remarks noted continued strong order backlog in fab. Can you give us a bit more color on how the current backlog compares to that at the time of Q2 and perhaps this time last year, recognizing normal seasonal patterns? And also on the fab margin side, you've obviously benefited from significant decline in raw materials cost of late. How do you think margins will develop as we head into Q4? And is there a risk given the current bidding environment, that if steel prices do recover a bit into 2020, you could see, once again, some margin weakness in this area? Theresa Wagler : Seth, so as it relates to the strong order backlog comment that I made on fabrication, as we look at this time last year, it's very similar. It might be just slightly less, but that's not abnormal as last year was pretty robust heading into the fall time frame. There's still a very strong order backlog from the fabrication perspective. And you're correct on the margin side equation. Declining steel prices obviously benefits the fabrication side of the business, but there's also been really robust demand on the construction side, which is a lot of pricing, which remained pretty robust as well. Heading into 2020 based on the customer's commentary and I think, Jim, they just had a big sales meeting, and the customer base, correct me if I'm wrong, is very optimistic about 2020 as well. Jim Anderson : That's correct. There's still plenty of activity described in our sales meeting last month. Theresa Wagler : So we're feeling really good about the fabrication business, Seth. Seth Rosenfeld : Just to follow up I guess. There's good sentiment from your construction customers. It's a great sign. But are they demanding kind of cut rate prices reflecting current steel price environment in the U.S., which, based on your current comment -- on your recent commentary, doesn't sound like you think is very sustainable into 2020. I guess the concern is, in order to get that backlog, is there some sacrifice on price? Or is ultimately the margin power still there? Theresa Wagler : We are not buying the backlog, if that's what you're asking. No. Pricing is holding up quite well in the fabrication arena. And so it's not a matter -- the words you used was -- I'm not sure I got it, because steel prices are going down that it's reflecting in the same amount of increase in the fabrication pricing. No, that's not happening. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Keches with Barclays. Andrew Keches : A couple of quick ones on the balance sheet. Mark Millett : Andrew, sorry, but we're having a little bit of a noise problem. If you would, just speak a little slower and the other folks. Andrew Keches : Sure. Can you hear me now? Mark Millett : Yes. That's good. Yes. Andrew Keches : So just a clarification on the balance sheet. You -- looks like you lowered your leverage target from 3 to 2 turns. Can you just talk about the genesis of that? Is that a reflection of the market environment or potentially a reflection of investment opportunities? Or is there something else driving that? Theresa Wagler : Yes, absolutely. So last week, we were upgraded by all 3 rating agencies to investment grade, and so we are committed to maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. So in our mind, that target is a through-cycle net leverage of less than 2x. So that's the reason for the change in the investor deck. And you'll notice that even over the last 3 years, we've returned almost $1.6 billion of cash to investors, who are also investing over $1.2 billion in our own assets and acquisitions, and we maintained lower than net leverage of 2x. So we have that flexibility to still grow and make distributions and maintain that. We don't believe it's limiting at all. So that's the reason for the change. Andrew Keches : Okay. And just to clarify and I guess follow up, so is the commitment now to investment-grade ratings? Or is it still investment-grade metrics, and the metric has been lowered? Theresa Wagler : It's -- we're committed to investment-grade ratings and so net leverage of less than 2x through-cycle. Andrew Keches : Okay. And then just last one. You clearly have a lot of the capital structure that's callable in the near term. Have you given thought to opportunities to perhaps improve the capital structure? Theresa Wagler : So we are always assessing the capital deck per layout of maturities if you will, and we do have 3 tranches that are available or callable at this point in time. So we'll be assessing the market in the near term to determine what that opportunity set may look like. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Curtis Woodworth : Theresa, just a question on thinking about modeling cash flow for 2020. Can -- I think you said that the new mill is $1.2 billion. Can you discuss other capital requirements, maintenance CapEx? And then would you anticipate a working capital build as you get raw materials, labor, whatnot to get the new mill in position to ramp in mid-'21? Theresa Wagler : Curt, I will give you preliminary thoughts, and then we'll round out with more detail as we have the fourth quarter conference call in January. We're still developing some of our capital requests for next year. But in totality, I would assume that next year with the $1.2 billion expected to be spent on Sinton, we're likely to spend another $100 million to $150 million. So probably looking at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of CapEx next year. Again, we'll be more specific on the call. As it relates to working capital, you shouldn't see significant working capital changes in 2020. You start to see more of that in the first half of 2021. So aside from market dynamics, which obviously, you can model on what your expectations are for 2020, there's nothing that would be structurally different in my estimation for working capital. Curtis Woodworth : Okay. And then just a question for Mark in terms of thinking about the cadence of the ramp at Sinton. Would you expect to sort of light both electric arcs at the same time? Is there any consideration in terms of environmental or operating permits that are going to be staggered? Just to get a sense for maybe kind of what your volume expectation is on how quickly you could ramp the new mill. Mark Millett : Well, there are no [ permanent ] or any sort of extraordinary reasons not to start the facility at its full rate. Typically, mills of that nature run around about -- after the first 6 months or so, in their first year, run around about 80% of their rated capacity, which in this case is 2 million tons. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Korn : Just following up on a couple of earlier questions. Clearly, supply side issues have been front of mind for many of us, number of quarters. Prices are weak. Demand outlook, optimistic, maybe a little fuzzy. What are your expectations, if any, for any serious capacity rationalization over the next year, over the next 2 years? Do you think the industry will need it? And do you think we're going to get it? Mark Millett : Well, that seems to be the topic du jour, I guess, and I think the -- in terms of the aggregate list of new capacity expansions that are being sort of discussed there is ever changing. And I think it's reducing. If you look at the -- on the long product side, you have Republic come off, [ Baker-Hansen ] come off. On the flat-rolled side, U.S. Steel is suggesting that they'll shut down 2 -- idle 2 blast furnaces. AK is coming off independently so that Ashland will never come back. JSW has changed its thoughts. So the total aggregate number of additional tons seems to keep decreasing. The most recent news that U.S. Steel delivered suggested that there will be some rationalization there, meaningful rationalization. So I think that the industry will continue to evolve. We as a U.S. industry need to operate, need to be competitive on a global basis. And I think the industry has been responsible and moving in that direction. Obviously, there is, on the flat-rolled side, some real capacity coming on. You could probably say about 6 million, 6.5 million tons of real capacity we'll be seeing in 2, 3 years' time in the marketplace. But between now and then, the market -- 2/3 of the market is going to continue to grow somewhat. And we are quite volatile on a longer term. The trade constraints, so the regionalism that is pervasive today, I think is going to erode imports or keep imports under control. Our North American demand, particularly in Mexico, will continue to grow and for those like ourselves that are in a position to service that new market, it's going to be very valuable for us. Sort of the U.S. energy independence that we're achieving now, I think has been understated. People are not talking about it, but that's going to be a huge economic driver, both of the economy and of fixed asset investment. We're seeing, just in Texas alone, the LNG plants, the permits, the $38 billion of infrastructure that is likely planned. So that is a -- I think that's an understated sort of growth opportunity there. Now the USMCA domestic product is going to increase demand, I think, for us all. The tax reform, the fixed asset investment is going to continue. And there's going to be inevitably, at some point in time, infrastructure spend. Now, it may not be this year, but [ it will be going on ]. So in general, we're incredibly bullish, and the market is going to be able to support that increased capability. Matthew Korn : Appreciate the comments. Let me ask -- let me follow up another one. Just clarifying, when I'm looking at your Long Products division, what in particular is driving the weakness we're seeing in the structurals and in the engineered bar, where you're seeing the volume declines year-over-year? Is this largely market conditions? Is this still some lingering operational issues? Do you see any chance of improvement on the volume side in the near term? And then I think I heard you correctly. It sounds like you do have confidence of achieving particularly more full utilization next year. Mark Millett : I think the -- on the engineered bar side of things, that is driven principally by market, but the sort of industrial manufacturing base, it's certainly softened. On the structural side, for us, actually, I'll start with rail and beams. Rail, we're actually increasing market share there. We'll probably ship 200,000 tons, I think, for 2019. Structural heavy beams certainly is under pressure, yes. Chris Graham : Yes. It continues to be an over-served market, Mark. I think that there is a definite switch from ordering out of rollings. This is the same story everywhere, whether it's destocking or they were overly aggressive in their buying habits at the end of last year. It's on the floor, and there isn't a day or 2 they're not getting into rollings. So we see steady demand, but we see that people are literally not buying a lot of steel that they don't need. Friday, they're not buying it on a Wednesday because the price may be different on Thursday. And it just seems to be the general trend in all of our markets. Mark Millett : On the structural side, scrap plays a critical role there. And when you have a market that has gone down 8 out of 10 months, the buyer is just hesitant. They expect lower prices the next month and the next month and the next month. And so I think when we'll see the scrap stabilizes here over the next couple of months, people will come back to the marketplace. Chris Graham : Yes, Mark, our structural share has actually increased in this slower market. And when we talk about the rig count [ striking things ], we've just been -- it has [ allegiance to the ] markets. We're continuing to set efficiency records and production records. [ Both ] facilities, there's the new rebar projects are starting to bear fruit, record production in September. I think given any market change, we're well positioned to capitalize. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Timna Tanners : Wanted to just follow up on scrap. I think it's -- I don't know if it's never been seen before or very unusual to see, as you know, 8 months out of 10 falling prices. So I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on if there's been structural changes. Obviously, Turkey is buying less. But in the past, we said that at low prices, supply will just shrink and dry up, and it hasn't happened yet. I'm just wondering if there's something structural or how we should think about scrap going forward. And along those same lines, if falling scrap keeps people from buying, at some point, they have to buy. So it can't be the only -- can't be the explanation for this whole year's softness, at least in long products like you were just saying. So I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on how you see the scrap market going forward and how it's gotten to where it is. Russ Rinn : Yes. Timna, this is Russ. Thanks for the question. I think scrap market, as you look forward, I think is -- again, for the balance of the year, it's probably flat, maybe could go up slightly. Again, if the Turkey situation was static as it was last month, we were starting to see the Turks come back in the marketplace more firmly. With the new imposition of tariffs, that may change. We don't know yet. But again, I think it's a very difficult thing. In defense of mill buyers, when they see the prices going down like that every month, they're just hesitant. So they're buying hand and mouth on their buys. And so we -- for our perspective, we would like to see a steady scrap market. We have not seen a dramatic drop-off in flows of scrap. It has slowed down some, but it's not been dramatic. So I think people are just trying to ride it out and realizing just like in 2015, sometimes the market works against you and you just got to stay with it. Timna Tanners : Okay. Got you. My only other question was I saw some language in your release, and I'm sorry I didn't go back and find it, the verbiage exactly. But I saw some language where you said you were still looking at growth options that could be organic or acquisitive and obviously, with your strong free cash flow even with Sinton. I'm just wondering if you could characterize what those look like. Any M&A that you might be looking at, just broad brushstrokes? It's interesting to see Bayou go bankrupt and nobody bid for them. So I'm just wondering what are the criteria that you might look for, if any, for M&A? Mark Millett : Well, Timna, obviously, with the Sinton project, we're being a lot more fickle I would suggest in looking at other opportunities. The pipeline continues to -- as you say, I think there continues to be opportunities out there. As we have been in the past, we've been incredibly sort of responsible and disciplined and are only going to move forward with something if the returns are extremely good and it provides strategic opportunity for us. Principal focus obviously is in that stream value-add and pull-through type opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yes. Just one question from me. There seems to be a lot of speculation over the next couple of years that some amount of U.S. steel capacity will kind of have to leave the market to make room for some of the incoming capacity that's entering the market. Is that how you see it? And if so, do you have a sense or an estimate or a guesstimate of how much capacity you would expect to see leave the U.S. market over the next 24 months or so? Mark Millett : I think that it's incredibly difficult to quantify that. Obviously, there are players out there that we will imagine are underwater at current market prices. I think you can read between the lines that there's some rationalization sort of planned or will take place, but the [ going to find out ] is -- would be a little speculative. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yes. No. I understand. I guess I'm just thinking about it from a market balance point of view. I've been speaking to a lot of investors. I think there's a lot of bearish people out there looking at steel price and expect the steel price to remain under pressure for quite some time just because demand seems to be flat. Obviously, we all know there's a lot of capacity coming. So one would kind of have to assume that a similar amount of capacity would have to leave the market in order for these prices to go back up unless demand all of a sudden recovers. But yes, I mean, look, I fully understand it's a difficult question to answer. It's just something we're grappling with. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jarmoszuk with Stifel. Nicholas Jarmoszuk : First, Mark, it's really difficult to hear you. I was hoping if you'd get a little closer to the microphone. And then a question for you on -- one of the EAF competitors is talking about putting up a new mill in Brownsville. I was hoping you could talk about whether that changes how you think about the market opportunity and the ROI on the project. Mark Millett : Well, I guess there, it's what -- we're here to talk about SDI specifically and not hypothesize about the future 3 or 4 years out, to be honest. With our mill, all I can say is it's filling our portfolio. We continue to grow even more so in any day as we talk to prospective customers relative to our Sinton investment. And to be clear, we're not building just a new mill there but establishing a new business horizon for SDI in the Southwest U.S. and Mexico. And we've got an incredible team with probably the deepest breadth of talent to execute on a construction project of this size and start it up and operate it. And we have looked all along the Gulf Coast there and including Brownsville. And the Sinton location, I think will provide the least expensive freight to our targeted markets. It's got the best constructability and most importantly provides the lowest operating cost solution when all things are considered. You can't just look at freight alone or any one particular component. You have to look at all the services, the utilities, transportation, the scrap inbound, cold coil inbound. And so we're incredibly excited, to be honest, there's the team in Sinton. And as I said earlier, we're not having more of the same, the technology and the process or anything. We'll provide a differentiated product that's unavailable in the U.S. market today. And our product is real. It's an expansion of a fully demonstrated growth profile that we've sustained through our 25-year history. And so the commentary out there, I think is unfortunate to be further asked of the rhetoric, the speculations, the sensationism that seems to dominate the steel space today. It's taken away the focus from real value growth performance of some steel companies, SDI is one of them. Nicholas Jarmoszuk : Okay. The audio is still really difficult to hear. I'll follow-up after the call. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Philip Gibbs : Mark, you spoke a little bit about it in your prepared remarks, but I just wanted to see if you could review the rebar investments you've made in the market and where each of your respective projects stand right now. I think you talked about one of them but just if you could give the kind of state of affairs of both of those projects. Chris Graham : Yes. Phil, this is Chris. We did have a slow start on a couple of projects, as Mark has alluded to, but in my short time with the long products team, I've seen it heading in the right direction. The teams are debugging and commissioning. And they're good at it. We're just a new product. And so I would tell you, in the last 2 months, incredible strides are being made. We're actually ahead of where I thought we'd be 60 days ago, and the teams are taking it right to capacity, and we're looking forward to the rest of the year and 2020 as being [ locked in ] those regions.  I would tell you that our medium-section mill in Columbia City where we run the rebar had just -- last month really had their second greatest production month in their history. And that would not have been the case in this market without the rebar project. And so I think it was good vision to add these product lines in an over-served market, and it's providing benefits already. And there's a lot of upside there, Phil. Mark Millett : Yes. Specifically, Roanoke, as I said, I think was around about 70% to 80% of its rated capacity currently. Columbia City is way behind that. It's about 50% of its rate. The good thing is that Roanoke can't make enough. The market, particularly on the cut-to-length, the custom length business, we can sell all that we make. That's a good thing particularly when you look at the market in general. Chris Graham : And Mark, the thing with Columbia City, last year, I'd say that the recent performance is above that 50% range, and they're going to maintain it. Philip Gibbs : So a couple of hundred -- it sounds like a couple of hundred thousand more tons to potentially get out on an annualized basis next year if I'm hearing you correctly. Okay. And then 2 on Heartland, because that's obviously been a growth area for you all, where you acquired that business. Where do we see utilization right now? And then can you just describe how Heartland is being integrated with your legacy operations? Because I know you had to at least purchase a lot of hot-rolled on the open market before you started integrating that. Barry Schneider : Yes. Phil, this is Barry Schneider. And Heartland is fitting in really well. The galv line is actually running at a level much higher than what they had historically run. And that is -- has been the previous owner's main shipments are only galvanized. So we've increased that capacity to the team through some key investments, small investments in innovation. But the pickle line and the cold mill there are running very well. And what they're doing currently is taking product from our Butler operation and providing a good cold-rolled base to get to our Jeffersonville facility, which is allowing, as Theresa mentioned earlier, substantially more value-added products to be produced under the combination of Butler and Heartland working together. That's a very good cost alternative for us. It also allows for -- as the product mix gets very light on some of these products, it allows us to get a lot more footage out of these products, which not necessarily shows up as tons but the products are much lighter in gauge and narrower. So a lot more build time to make them. So at this point, that's running very well. We do see advances in selling more cold-rolled product off of the mill. That's an area where we historically have not participated. So we do have good leads and good development streams to get more of those products out. And right now, I'm really happy to say that the Heartland team's doing all this with the same level of manning that they've had historically. So that team has really responded well to the challenge and the Steel Dynamics' approach to working and how they're engaged with their products and their owners of their other business. And they really take it to a [ great wall ]. Philip Gibbs : Appreciate the comments and congratulations on the formal achievement of the investment grade on the debt. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Kenyon with Cowen. Tyler Kenyon : I just wanted to go back to an earlier question on cash flow just moving into next year. I think you've identified $150 million to $155 million of property tax benefits associated with the Sinton investment, but I think it may take some time to realize the full extent of those. Are there any other cash tax savings we should be thinking about in 2020 as you spend this capital? And any way to quantify that? Theresa Wagler : The major benefit will come actually, Tyler, in 2021 as the facility starts up, and you will immediately be able to deduct the capital spent under the new tax rules, which other companies do as well. But as you're constructing, it's not that you're deducting it as you spend it. And you're correct. The $150 million to $155 million of tax benefit actually will accrue to us over, call it, a 5- to 10-year period. Tyler Kenyon : Okay. Is there any way to think about what that cash tax savings could be in 2021, either on a cash tax rate basis or in terms of absolute dollars? Theresa Wagler : There is. I'm not prepared to give you that number today, but we'd be happy to do that in a later call. Tyler Kenyon : Okay. And then just one last one for me. Wanted to just ask about the Vulcan business. We've seen some duties put in place on an outstanding trade case on threaded rod. I know a small market, but curious if you've seen any benefit from a pricing perspective since the trade case has been announced and since we've seen some duties put in place. And then if you could maybe perhaps help me with trying to quantify the actual size of that market. Chris Graham : This is Chris. We've definitely seen some assistance in the threaded rod arena because of the tariff discussions. Some of the largest consumers of threaded rod who are buying 100% offshore are coming to visit our team for the first time in decades. Now Vulcan does make several products, heat-treat and cold finish. Those are more directly related to scrap. And so they've had the same pressures. But you're right. It's a good point on low tariffs on threaded rod. We've not -- there's been a disconnect with the scrap pricing. It's been -- we've gotten some pricing power there. One comment as you talk about the cases, I think it's interesting. Some of the products Vulcan make imports hold as much as 85% share. And so you're right. It's been an interesting case to follow. And we believe there's going to be some opportunities for Vulcan to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : I was very encouraged that the August industry shipments of 8.47 million tons to holiday month, they were the highest in several years. Were Steel Dynamics' shipments higher in September than in August, to signal an improving trend? And do you think the industry will get over 9 million tons for October, which seasonally is the stronger month in the second half? Theresa Wagler : John, I would say that generally our shipments weren't extraordinarily higher nor lower from August to September across the platform. And I don't think that we can get what October will be for the industry. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, again, as in the past, certainly appreciate your interest and your time today. To our customers that may be on the line, thank you for your business, and hopefully we continue to earn your trust in the business. And to our employees, again, safety, safety, safety. Thanks for all you do. You do a hell of a job. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia and welcome. Good morning everybody and happy 2020. Thanks for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. We certainly appreciate your time today. To begin, I would like to thank the entire SDI team and their families for their extraordinary dedication and passion. 2019 represented a period of market challenge yet the team achieved numerous operational milestones as well as a strong financial performance, record steel shipments, record fabrication shipments to name just two. 2019 represented the third best year since our inception in 1993, the best testament to the superior performance of our teams and our differentiated business model. And to impart clarity, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire Steel Dynamics team. It was a strong year with many operational milestones as well as being one of the best years financially. Revenues of $10.5 billion derived from record steel and fabrication volumes represented our second highest annual performance. Operating income of $987 million and net income of $671 million or $3.04 per diluted share represented our third best annual performance. Cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion and EBITDA of $1.3 billion represented our second and third best performances respectively and notably, the achievement of gaining an investment-grade credit rating designation and recognition of our capital foundation and capital allocation philosophy. Regarding our fourth quarter 2019 performance, net income was $121 million or $0.56 per diluted share which includes financing costs related to our December 2019 refinancing activities of approximately $0.01 per diluted share and lower earnings resulting from our two planned annual maintenance outages at our Butler and Columbus Flat Roll Division of approximately $0.05 per diluted share. The outage has also impacted fourth quarter flat-rolled steel shipments by an estimated 70,000 tons to 80,000 tons. Fourth quarter earnings were above our mid-quarter guidance of $0.49 per diluted share to $0.53 per diluted share primarily due to stronger-than-anticipated December steel shipments. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income would have been $0.62 per diluted share above our adjusted guidance of $0.55 to $0.59 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2019 revenues were $2.4 billion, 18% lower than fourth quarter 2018 sales and 6% lower than sequential third quarter results, as average realized steel prices declined. Our fourth quarter 2019 operating income was $182 million, 50% lower than prior year fourth quarter earnings and 20% lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower realized flat-rolled steel pricing which more than offset the benefit of lower scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you will find we are constructive considering underlying steel demand and optimistic concerning our unique earnings catalysts. Within our steel operations, fourth quarter shipments declined sequentially a modest 2% to 2.7 million tons. However, our steel volumes increased 3% compared to last year as value-added shipments from our Flat Roll operations grew. Our average quarterly realized external steel sales price decreased $45 per ton sequentially to $764 in the fourth quarter. And average scrap costs only declined $32 per ton causing lower steel metal margins. The result was fourth quarter steel operating income of $201 million, 16% lower than third quarter results due to our planned Flat Roll outages, seasonally lower shipments and lower realized steel pricing. For the full year 2019, our steel facilities achieved numerous production and shipment records. The platform's operating income was $1 billion less than third -- excuse me less than record 2018 results of $1.9 billion due to lower flat-rolled steel metal margin. Annual overall metal spread declined from the historical highs experienced in 2018. Everyone should be proud as 2019 was a challenging steel environment based on significant customer destocking. While we achieved record annual steel shipments of 10.8 million tons in 2019, we still have additional market opportunity with annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons. We continue to grow our internal manufacturing capability during 2019. It's a powerful strategic advantage to have internal processing capability to sustain higher steel mill utilization during weaker demand environments to create optionality of supply for our customers and to allow for value-added product upside in all market environments. For our metals recycling platform fourth quarter ferrous price indices declined approximately $35 per gross ton and volumes were seasonally lower. This challenging market resulted in a fourth quarter operating loss of $5 million compared to operating income of $3 million sequentially. As spare scrap prices declined in eight of 12 months during 2019, our metals recycling operations annual operating income decreased to $28 million in 2019 compared to $88 million in 2018. Approximately 65% of our metals recycling ferrous shipments serve our own steel mills increasing scrap quality, melt efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. As a company we reintroduced over 11 million tons of recycled ferrous materials and 1.1 billion pounds of recycled nonferrous materials into the manufacturing life cycle in 2019. For our fabrication business fourth quarter 2019 operating income of $33 million remained aligned with sequential result and was our third best quarter. The team also achieved record quarterly shipments in what is traditionally a seasonally slower time frame substantially offsetting a modest decline in prices. For full year 2019, our fabrication operations achieved record shipments of 644,000 tons and operating income of $119 million, almost double last year's earnings. Order activity was strong throughout 2019 supporting higher average sales prices as average steel input costs declined resulting in margin expansion. We continue to see strong order inquiry and customer optimism. We're beginning the year with a strong project backlog. Our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong. During the fourth quarter 2019, we generated $409 million of cash flow from operations and for the full year $1.4 billion, our second best year. 2019 capital investments totaled $452 million of which $205 million related to our new Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill investment. We currently estimate 2020 full year capital investments to be in the range of $1.4 billion; $1.2 billion allocated to the Sinton Texas steel mill; $60 million to complete Columbus' third galvanizing line which should start operating mid-2020; and the remaining $140 million related to smaller growth projects or sustaining projects. Regarding shareholder distributions, after a 28% increase in first quarter of 2019, we maintained our cash dividend for the fourth quarter at $0.24 per common share. We also repurchased $56 million of our common stock during the fourth quarter totaling $349 million for the full year 2019 with $51 million remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Since 2016, we've invested $1.1 billion repurchasing approximately 14% of our outstanding shares. We believe these actions reflect the strength of our capital structure, consistent cash flow capability and liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We achieved record liquidity of $2.8 billion at December 31, 2019 representing $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.2 billion of available funding under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Regarding our new Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill, the investment is still expected to be approximately $1.9 billion. We just received the required environmental permits last week allowing full construction efforts to begin with the current expectation of operations beginning midyear 2021. Based on this timeline, we estimate the remaining capital investment to be approximately $1.7 billion, again, $1.2 billion to be funded in 2020 with the remaining $500 million to be funded in the first half of 2021. We've also been awarded approximately $155 million in state and local incentive benefits that will be received over time. Collectively, our primary strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through-cycle historical spread basis. The estimate includes our planned Sinton Texas steel mill and the third galvanizing line at Columbus, as well as our two operational rebar expansions. In October, we received an investment grade rating designation from three rating agencies. We filed this upgrade in December with the syndication of a new $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and the execution of our inaugural investment-grade notes offering. We issued $400 million of 2.8% notes, and $600 million of 3.45% notes. We used the proceeds to repay $700 million of existing 5.125% notes and for other general corporate purposes. We're very appreciative and excited concerning the incredible receptiveness of the investment-grade market. These transactions extended our debt maturity profile and will reduce annual interest costs. Receiving the designation of investment-grade is a natural progression of our strategic growth and recognition of our strong balance sheet profile and sustainable through cash free \u2013 sustainable through-cycle free cash flow generation capability. Due to the strength and optionality within our capital structure, and the free cash flow generating business model, we have the flexibility for continued growth and responsible shareholder distributions, while also being dedicated to preserving investment-grade credit ratings. Our capital allocation still prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable growth and optimized long-term shareholder value creation. For those of you that track more specifically our flat-rolled shipments. For the fourth quarter, we had hot rolled and pickled and oiled shipments of 838,000 tons; cold rolled shipments of 167,000 tons; and finally coated shipments of 911,000 tons. Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. Thanks for the detail. I think it profiles an incredible job by an incredible team. As we've always suggested and execute upon safety is always \u2013 has been our number one value and our first priority. Nothing surpasses the importance of creating and maintaining a safe environment for our people. Our 2019 incident rate crept up slightly and our lost time rate ticked up a little above our 2018 record low. But most importantly, our severity rate continued to improve in 2019. While our safety performance remains significantly better than our industry averages, it's not enough. We all must be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members around us. Safety must always be top of mind, and I challenge all of us to remain focused and to keep moving toward our ultimate goal of no injuries. The fabrication platform delivered an outstanding performance with the team achieving record annual earnings and shipments. Profit margins expanded as average 2019 product pricing rose and raw material steel input costs declined. Additionally, the fabrication platform provided increased utilization for our steel operations, purchasing over 438,000 tons of steel internally. The fabrication group is confident regarding 2020. Despite seasonality, they achieved record fourth quarter volumes. The order backlog is even stronger entering 2020 than it was this time last year, and the customer base is optimistic concerning non-residential construction projects. Our metals recycling team also supported our steel operations by supplying over one-third of our steel mill scrap requirements during the year. 2019 was particularly difficult in the metals recycling industry with ferrous scrap prices declining in each of eight months. The combination of trade and uncertainty around China's environmental policies also pressured recycled non-ferrous prices and demand. This month-over-month price drop decreased earnings during the year. But within this backdrop, the team continued to focus on efficiency gains which yielded sustainable positive results. Prime scrap prices have normalized, increasing approximately $80 per gross ton since October, recovering from the tepid demand environment caused by low-middle utilization rates manifested by numerous maintenance outages and coupled with an uptick in export activity. A stable or rising market should return the recycling platform to more normalized earnings. Longer term, with steady scrap supply from the manufacturing base and the potential for additional scrap substitute production in the United States, we believe scrap supply will outpace demand creating a positive steel mill -- steel margin environment. The steel team delivered a strong performance with record 2019 shipments and numerous production records. Our steel processing and conversion locations also supported our steel mills. Including the fabrication platform, we transferred over 1.4 million tons of steel internally or about 13% of our total 2019 steel shipments. Our manufacturing businesses provide a powerful utilization level for our steel mills, increasing through-cycle utilization thereby compressing fixed costs and supporting solid cash flow generation. Even though 2019 was one of our best years, it was challenged by high customer steel inventories throughout the supply chain as many customers purchased beyond normal demand levels in 2018. While domestic steel demand remained steady through the year, inventory destocking drove flat-rolled steel prices lower. As an example, average 2019 hot-rolled coil price indices decreased over $225 per ton. Fortunately, pricing firmed in the fourth quarter as destocking subsided and inventory levels were right sized. Long product steel pricing and shipments remain pressured by excess domestic supply and continued import competition. However, we are seeing the benefits from our recent investments in product diversification and supply chain differentiation helping to offset some of these market pressures. Underlying domestic steel demand remains intact to the primary steel consuming sectors, including automotive and construction. Additionally, steel consumed by the pipeline infrastructure for the collection and distribution of liquids and gases continues to be strong and we expect it to remain so as the U.S. continues its energy independence journey. We believe North American steel consumption will continue to improve with Mexican growth outpacing that of the U.S. based on meaningful increases in Mexico's manufacturing base. Furthermore, we believe the U.S. trade position will continue to support moderated steel imports, and when coupled with the increased domestic steel content requirements included in the recent USMCA for automotive producers, provides a positive landscape for domestic steel production. We continue to competitively position Steel Dynamics for the future through optimization of our existing operations and differentiated growth investments. During 2019, we invested over $385 million in our steel platform. And specifically in the first quarter, we completed a 240,000 ton rebar expansion in our Structural and Rail Division. This differentiated rebar supply chain model is expected to meaningfully enhance customer optionality and flexibility, providing significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits for our customers. Including our 2018 Roanoke Bar rebar investment, we now have 440,000 tons of rebar capability shipping 40% of this volume in 2019. Market dependent, we plan to increase rebar shipments to over 375,000 tons in 2020. Within the flat roll group, the 2018 acquisition of Heartland provides value-added product diversification. The Heartland team achieved record annual shipments with no additional staffing in 2019. The 500,000-ton plus shipping volume represented over 60% of their expected 800,000-ton planned run rate. During 2020, we plan to hire additional team members to increase utilization to over 80%. Additionally, by allocating lighter gauge flat roll production to Heartland, our Butler Flat Roll Division has increased its value-added production output setting new volume records. I'd like to applaud the Heartland team for a highly successful integration into our family. We're also in the process of value-added growth at our Columbus Flat Roll Division. Columbus has transformed its product offering through the addition of the paint line and the introduction of more complex grades of flat rolled steel. The diversion of product to these diversified value-added outlets has reduced the volume of product available to our existing galvanized steel customers. To address this the lack of sufficient galvanizing capability, we're building a third galvanizing line at Columbus. The $140 million 400,000-ton galvanizing line will begin operations mid-2020. While satisfying our customer demand, the product realignment will decrease Columbus' hot rolled coil exposure allowing for an existing customer base in the region to provide a good baseload for our new Texas steel facility. And we continue to become even more excited about the material growth the construction of this new next-generation Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill will deliver. Our construction and start-up team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, start-up and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than exists in any other company in the industry. The core group began site work in the second half of 2019 and we're excited to announce the recent receipt of the required environmental permitting to allow for full construction efforts to begin. The Texas mill will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities with state-of-the-art environmental processes. Our existing steel mills literally have a fraction of the energy intensity about 11% and greenhouse gas emission intensity of average world steelmaking technology. There's a tremendous amount of excitement both internally at SDI and outside as we continue to add engineers and professionals to the on-site team. We are moving fast and building our team. The new state-of-the-art 3 million ton steel mill will include value-added coating lines comprised of a 550,000-ton galvanizing line and a 250,000-ton paint line with Galvalume capability. The Texas mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc-furnace flat roll steel producers, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The mill will have the capability to produce higher-strength, tougher grades of flat rolled steel for the energy and automotive markets. This is due to having a cyclical section and a more conventional two-stage hot rolling process which allows for thermomechanical rolling. The mill will be capable of 84-inch wide 1-inch thick 100 ksi hot rolled coil product that is unavailable in the United States today. Additionally, large oiled coils will provide energy pipe producers intrinsic cost and yield savings. The configuration will also allow us to ship certain plate products on a limited basis, providing further product diversification. The steel mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas, which is adjacent to Corpus Christi. The site has a significant competitive advantages, including geographic market position, power accessibility, freight benefits, water availability and constructability. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we expect the potential customer savings to be a minimum of $20 to $30 per ton and for some much higher. In addition, customers will be able to place orders with a much shorter lead time, providing significant delivery and working capital advantages. We have the opportunity to provide steel in terms of weeks versus months. These benefits provide a differentiated supply chain solution, allowing us to effectively compete with imports arriving in from Houston and the West Coast, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. These advantages will also give the North American pipe producers a competitive supply chain to once again compete with the foreign pipe producers that have dominated the market. Customers are excited to have a regional flat rolled steel supplier and we have several customers already committed to locate on-site with us, representing over 800,000 tons -- annual tons of local steel processing and consumption capability. From a raw materials perspective, our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management agreements, much of which is prime scrap. We also plan to cost-effectively source pig iron through the port system so we are confident in our ability to procure high-quality raw materials in the region. We have three targeted regional sales markets, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption and we believe this will increase in the coming years as Mexico continues to grow. We have 7 million tons from the four state region of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which has limited domestic regional supply and relies heavily on imports. Sinton lies in close proximity for both rail and truck delivery in this region. There are 4 million tons of consumption from the underserved West Coast region, which also relies heavily on imports and approximately 16 million tons from the growing Northern and mid-Central Mexican regions. In 2018, the Mexican market imported 7.5 million tons of flat-rolled steel. Based on their growing manufacturing base, we believe Mexican demand growth will continue to outpace supply making this an even more attractive underserved market in the coming years. Sinton will have the most freight advantaged shipments into this region from the U.S. We've been developing a flat-rolled steel strategy for these regions and Mexico for several years. We've been cultivating both customer and scrap relationships and we are confident in the long-term strategic value and investment profile this project provides. We thank the Sinton community for their continued enthusiastic support and truly look forward to growing together in the future. We believe our unique operating culture coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost-effective and highly profitable steel mills positions us well to execute the strategic initiatives. To be clear, we're not just adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We're expanding our whole SDI business model into the Southwest and into Mexico. We will have a differentiated product portfolio. We will have a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage. We will effectively compete with steel imports and we have targeted regional markets. In conclusion, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability, as recently recognized by our investment-grade rating designation. Our exceptional team provides the foundation for our success. I am proud of our recent inclusion as one of the world's most admired companies by Fortune Magazine. It is a testament to our incredible team. Each one contributes. Each one has an impact. And I thank each and every one of you for your passion and commitment to excellence. Remember to be safe for yourselves, your team and your families. We're committed to providing exemplary long-term value to our fellow colleagues, communities, customers and shareholders and look forward to creating new opportunities for all. So, again, thank you for your time today. Melissa, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Martin Englert with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Martin Englert : Hi, good morning, everyone. Mark Millett : Good morning. Martin Englert : Within the release and prepared remarks you noted expectations of modest demand growth in North America. What percentage growth do you think that implies? And perhaps if you can provide a little bit more detail maybe on specific end markets puts and takes, whether you're expecting ongoing growth and perhaps contraction. Mark Millett : Yes certainly. I think we are incredibly constructive on the market in general going into 2020 and 2021 to be \u2013 for that matter. Because again underlying demand last year didn't dissipate. The whole price drop was the sort of a drawdown or destocking of customer inventory and that obviously is reversed here in the last couple of months of the year and going into 2020. And so, it's a very positive market. You have the two principal markets, flat roll markets automotive and construction in great, great shape and that represents 60%, 70% of the market. There's incredible optimism on the construction side. New manning and building systems, our fabrication platform has an incredible business going into the year and I think that bodes incredibly well for construction in general. And it also parallels with our pre-paint building products on the flat roll side. So construction we believe is going to be very, very strong in the year. As I mentioned earlier, we think the energy sort of pipeline infrastructure is going to be strong for the year and for the next two or three years, as we go down that path of energy independence and drawing all those energy products down to the Coast for export. Downhole energy is a little weak perhaps. But again, the improving demand environment -- and if you look at our order books generally, they've been very, very strong. Pricing is very, very robust. Lead times have stretched out. The 232 tariffs have had their impact, but just the trade environment in general is very positive. And obviously, the passage of the USMCA is already garnering results. We're certainly seeing foreign sort of auto producers that were bringing material in from Asia and from Europe looking for domestic sourcing and we've been the beneficiary and we've been picking up dramatic amount of market share there. On the long product side, again pretty bullish there. I think some of the cloud of uncertainty is lifting a little bit and there's general optimism. And as I've said in the past calls, engineered bar is our sort of bellwether for the steel-consuming environment. And generally, they're seeing a pretty strong uptick. A lot of that -- or some of that could be just that customers overshot the destocking and the restocking, but we truly believe underlying demand is robust. Automotive is strong there. We're seeing a very, very strong pickup in our supply to coat finishes. There's even a pickup in the seamless tube market. Trailers and yellow -- trailer is a little flat, but even yellow goods is picking up. So we're seeing good strong benefit there. And then obviously we'll benefit Pittsboro and our Structural and Rail Division as they send more blooms down to -- there for conversion. Roanoke business merchant shapes is okay. In Structural and Rail Division, I think we're seeing a little softness a little softening in rail CapEx from the major railroads, but we seem to be picking up market share. The team has done a phenomenal job. We produce some of the highest-quality rail in the world. And we're penetrating the transit and high-speed rail environment. So that's a good business for us. And again parallel flange in the structural arena, we see that being pretty solid through the year. So generally, I think it's going to be a very good year a much more positive year than 2019. Martin Englert : Okay. I appreciate all the color there. And congratulations on the execution in challenging environment. Mark Millett : I appreciate it. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Thanks Martin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Terry : Hi, Mark and Theresa. Thanks for taking my question. The main thing I wanted to ask you about just in the shorter term just trying to link together scrap imports and the recent strength in HRC pricing and your comments on more normalized inventory levels. Have you seen anything just recently with talk that scrap is going to be down in February on the customer behavior side that may change where people restock destock and just the outlook maybe for the next couple of months? If you could comment on that first. Thanks. Mark Millett : Russ, do you want to comment on the scrap? Russ Rinn : Sure. Thanks, Chris. Again, as we look at scrap in 2019 we certainly had a very, very tough environment. I think the pricing levels overshot where they probably should have been and we've seen some of that come back in the last part of the year. I think, as we start into 2020, we're anticipating a more normalized year, some ups, some downs, but no substantial moves like we had last year. And in the short term, I think, we're looking at kind of a soft sideways. Certainly, the offshore pricing has declined slightly, but part of that's going to be offset, we believe, with the increased steel mill utilization domestically. So, we're not looking for any major changes. I think, the trend would be down slightly, but not a significant push down. Mark Millett : You want to -- I think, the weather in the Midwest is pretty moderate. So, flows are relatively strong on the absolute cut rates. We see very, very strong flow in prime grade still. Obviously, industrial business and most importantly automotive stamp plants are growing very, very strong. So the flow of scrap is good. And then, during the year, I think, you're going to see some additional sort of HBI alternative iron units come online. So we see a pretty stable raw material environment, with a strong product environment and I think that bodes very, very well for spreads through the year. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks, Mark, and thanks for the comments. Just a follow-up. Maybe you could just discuss a little bit more your expectations on the imports for the year. Obviously, it came down a lot last year. Your comments that they should come down further in 2020, predicated on the parity pricing. Or are there other factors at play there? Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, obviously, between the Section 201 countervailing duty and antidumping trade cases that have been with us for some time and will remain with us for a good long time as well and the 232, we saw a considerable moderation in imports through the year last year. I think, that will continue. Obviously, the arbitrage to European and Asian pricing is not totally attractive for folks to look offshore. So, again, I think, imports will be moderated. Chris Terry : Okay. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks, guys. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yes. Thank you very much and good morning everyone. I'm kind of just staying within the same line of questions. Most of the rhetoric we're getting, especially from the service centers and downstream steel buyers seems to be somewhat cautious, so I'm just wondering what you think the market is missing here because to Terry's point, scrap is probably going to come down. There's a lot of rhetoric suggesting that the steel price hike -- or hikes as we've seen them over the last three months have been mostly driven by higher scrap prices, whereas apparent U.S. steel demand, as a whole, has actually been declining. The futures price -- flat steel futures prices have taken a pretty meaningful step-down as well, suggesting that steel price could drop $30, $50 a ton from here. And we're going into an election year, which seems to suggest a lot of people are very cautious about how they're going to be spending CapEx and consumer spending as well. So I'm just wondering, your rhetoric is obviously a little bit more constructive on how you're seeing the market. So what do you think the market is missing at this point in time? Mark Millett : Well, all I can say is -- or comment on the market through our lens and as I suggested the -- our backlogs are very, very strong right now. They're incredibly strong in New Millennium Building Systems, which would suggest that the construction world is going to have a very, very good year. The distribution warehouse business in that arena is incredibly strong. So construction, we do believe, is going to be robust. Automotive has been running at a relatively record pace and the prognostication is that, okay, maybe off a little, but it's going to continue to be strong. As we look through the lens of engineered bar, which I suggested earlier is our bellwether that's a very, very healthy business and it's looking better now than it has for a couple of years going into the year. And flat roll remains very strong. Coated products and obviously we're the largest non-automotive coater in the states that is very, very strong for us. So again we can only see what we see. And we can only hear what we hear from our customers and there's general optimism out there. Part of that strength could be a little restocking as people overshot last year and that tends to happen. People buy too much and they -- then they go too short. But underlying demand in our mind is very, very solid. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That's very clear. Maybe a follow-up on that. Do you see that a lot of the strength in your order book may also be driven by inorganic growth? I mean you're effectively taking market share potentially from some of your peers in the market. Is that fair to say? Mark Millett : I think it's fair to say in the automotive arena in particular. And in the prepaint I don't think we're taking any further market share, because our lines are running flat out and we can't produce anymore. But with our Sinton plant with the added capability we will continue to add there. But yes so automotive we are picking up I think market share. The rest of our business is more straightforward market. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s very clear. Appreciate you answering my questions. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Hi, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Mark, if we could stick on automotive just for now, can you give us a picture in terms of how much of your business right now particularly in the sheet and SBQ arena is going into automotive? And maybe give us a view of where you are today versus where you thought you'd be when Columbus is going through their mix transition and then also where you're trying to go? Mark Millett : Philip, Barry will give you some clarity there. Barry Schneider : Well, Phil the automotive here we have is continuing to grow through the Columbus operation. There's a lot of different things we're doing with our auto team directly that is relatively new in the last five years to Steel Dynamics. And a lot of those awards are as a Tier 1 -- to Tier 1 suppliers are directly to automotive. So those continue to grow. We do always enjoy good business out of the Butler facility with automotive and that remains strong. So not only supplying service centers but directly we continue to grow as Mark indicated getting new market share as we are awarded new parts and our capabilities increase. So as a whole typically somewhere between 15% and 20% is automotive shipments coming out of our flat roll plants. Phil Gibbs : Thank you, Barry. Mark Millett : Chris from an SBQ standpoint? Chris Graham : Yeah. Phil this is Chris. Phil Gibbs : Hey Chris. Chris Graham : On the SBQ side, we're starting to leverage our existing and newfound relationships in the flat roll in the automotive group to open up opportunities for SBQ. We've -- recently the team has recently achieved some new automotive certifications that will allow us to lever our new inspection and testing equipment and our new rolling capacity there. So although it may be a relatively small number at our SBQ, the plan is to grow and I think the team is positioned well to do so. Mark Millett : And to be perhaps a little more specific at Columbus we -- as Barry said we're on platforms. Well, our market share has picked up already but we're on platforms over the next 12, 18 months to pick up probably 500,000 tons will be coming out of Columbus into direct automotive. And obviously when the Sinton plant comes online, we believe about one million tons will be going to Mexico and predominantly into the automotive arena. And if you just step back and look at automotive, for us, more generally, our traction has been incredibly quick and fast. For the automotive world they tend to in the past to react very, very slowly. Obviously, the USMCA is driving a lot of that, as folks are looking for domestic content. And they look to us, first and foremost, I think to our balance sheet. They want to partner with someone that's going to be around for the next 10, 20, 30 years. And our balance sheet is more solid than some folks,' I would say. They also look at our sustainability model. Obviously there's a lot of Europeans. And a lot of our traction has been with the European automotive makers BMW, Mercedes, VW. And they see our sustainability story as being very, very persuasive. The fact that, we will repurpose 10 million, 11 million tons of scrap each year, we're repurposing about one billion pounds of non-ferrous and there are a considerably more and more positive things with our ESG sustainability story. So they're attracted to that. And they're also attracted to our product development. So we are gaining a lot of market share, a lot of traction with the automotive industry in general. Phil Gibbs : Thanks Mark. And Barry you said 15% to 20%. Were you talking just to your overall flat roll business? Is that what you were speaking to? Theresa Wagler : No. Barry was actually speaking to our total steel shipments. Phil Gibbs : Okay. Theresa Wagler : We tend to be somewhere between 13% and 15% automotive. Phil Gibbs : Thanks. I have another one. But I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Cosgrove with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Cosgrove : Hi, Mark and Theresa. Thanks for taking my question. Just had a quick one on long product shipments, obviously, they were down 10% in 2019. And construction markets you guys see them recovering this year. So where would we see volumes pick up, if that materializes? Theresa Wagler : From a volume perspective on the long product side, I think a couple of things. One is the ramp-up of the rebar projects at both Roanoke and the Structural and Rail Division, should have a positive impact from gaining market share with the differentiated supply chain model that we have at those locations. And the fact that we'll be the only independent rebar producer in those regions. So we should be able to get improved volumes related to that. In addition, the Structural and Rail Division has additional capacity. They were only operating around 75% to 80% of their capacity last year. So when we mentioned that we have over two million tons of additional capability, a lot of that is in the long products region. And then, additionally, Mark mentioned the SBQ. And Chris, I think you would think there was opportunity in SBQ. Is that correct? Chris Graham : That's correct. Andrew Cosgrove : Okay. Mark Millett : I think, just to emphasize there when you look at the structural mill our heavy mill which is where we roll our rail that has been kind of at 100% utilization for some time. Our medium section mill is where we've been struggling. And that's where some of the rebar -- or not some. All the rebar there is produced. But we're in the good position. And we haven't been there for a long, long time. And that the medium section mill is pretty well at full utilization. Is that right, Chris? Chris Graham : Yeah. Mark Millett : So, it is turning. It's positive. Andrew Cosgrove : Okay. Thank you. And then, just one more on Heartland, I know in the middle of 2019, I think the target utilization rate by the second half was to get to 70%. You had mentioned before slightly over 60%. I guess a little over 500,000 tons. Is that kind of demand-oriented? Or was it more employee-driven? As you had mentioned, you're hiring more people for next year and looking to get to 80. So just kind of gauging the impact there and I guess, how close you could get to target next year as far as Heartland is concerned? Barry Schneider : Yes. We continue to develop markets for the Heartland operations. And right now internally, a lot of the growth at Heartland has been through debottlenecking our finished goods production and painted production through the Butler and Jeffersonville facilities. So, a lot of the development has been internally being able to get more products to our paint lines, where we could bring more value. So, as we look to external shipments, we've been right on the edge of where we need to add people and really just the team is finding new ways to get high productivity out of what they're doing. So, the last thing we do is bring people in because, we want to make sure, it's a sustainable growth. So we continue to find those markets and particularly in the cold rolled steel sales, which is something that because of our galvanizing campaigning, we typically haven't done as much cold roll sales. So we continue to make good ground there. But really internally, it's been great to get our paint lines just fully utilized and to fully develop those products in those customers. Andrew Cosgrove : Okay. Great. That\u2019s it from me. Mark Millett : I think you can expect that we shipped 500,000 tons a little over last year and that we'll be ramping up through the year to that 750,000 to 800,000-ton level. That's not going to happen this month or next month. But I think, as Barry said, as we gain new markets, you're going to see that ramp up through the year. Andrew Cosgrove : Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions and good luck for 2020. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Millet for any closing comments. Mark Millett : Well for those that are still on the line, thank you for your support, both from a customer and shareholder perspective. And also, our employees that I'm sure are still on the line, we truly appreciate everything you do for us. And I just want to emphasize that hey, let's be safe out there and make sure that your fellow teammates are safe as well. So, thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Once again ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Tricia. Good morning everybody. Welcome to our first quarter of 2020 earnings call. We certainly appreciate and value your time at these unprecedented circumstances. Steel making is designated a critical infrastructure industry by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but deemed essential to the nation\u2019s defense, infrastructure, transportation and overall economy. As such all our operations have been operating. Protecting the health and wellbeing of the teams is on this critical priority. We are closely monitoring the COVID 19 situation and have implemented numerous additional practices throughout the Company to protect each of us. I want to thank our more than 8,400 team members for remaining steadfast and passionate. We continue to operate safely with a spirit of excellence. I\u2019m incredibly proud to work alongside each of them during this unparallel time. We are committed to the health and safety of our people, the families and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. But before I continue, Theresa, will you please provide insights on the team\u2019s recent incredible performance during the first quarter that should not go unstated, despite these present environmental issues along with our strong financial foundation. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Our first quarter 2020 net income was $187 million or $0.88 per diluted share. Above our guidance of $0.83 to $0.87 due to stronger than anticipated March flat-rolled steel shipments. First quarter 2020 revenues were $2.6 billion somewhat lower than prior year\u2019s first quarter sales, 10% higher than fourth quarter sequential results driven by improved steel pricing and shipment. Our first quarter, 2020 operating income was $274 million, $18 million lower than prior year, first quarter, but notably 50% higher than sequential fourth quarter results due to record steel shipments driven by solid first quarter underlying demand. From a platform perspective our steel operation\u2019s first quarter shipments increased 7% sequentially to a record, 2.8 million tons with increased volumes experienced across the platform. Our average quarterly realized sales price increased $10 per ton $774 in the first quarter and average scrap cost increased $24 per ton, profiting steel metal margin compression. The result with first quarter steel operating income of $293 million, 45% higher than the sequential fourth quarter results. For our metals recycling platform first quarter operating income was $8 million compared to a loss of $5 million sequentially. A result of higher ferrous to non-ferrous selling values and shipment with prime scrap industries writing almost $30 per gross ton during the first quarter. About 65% of our mills recycling ferrous shipment served by all the steel mills, increasing our scrap quality, our melting efficiency and reducing our Companywide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both the platforms. For our steel fabrication business, first quarter of 2020 operating income remains strong at $29 million compared to near record sequential results of $33 million. Primarily due to seasonally lower first quarter shipments, we experienced record order inquiry and bookings in the first quarter and demarche with a record backlog. We are still experiencing strong order inquiry and are entering the traditional construction season on a good footing. Our cash generation continues to be strong. During the first quarter of 2020 we generated $211 million of cash flow from operations offset by operational working capital growth related to higher steel selling values and the $74 million distribution of our annual companywide profit sharing to our teams. We spent $218 million in fixed asset investments during the first quarter of which 130 million related to our New Sinton, Texas Flat-rolled Steel Mill investment. To-date we have funded $335 million of the $1.9 billion project. Regarding shareholder distributions, we increased our cash dividends 4% in the first quarter of this year to $0.25 per common share. This follows increases of over 20% in both 2018 and 2019, the Board also authorized an additional $500 million for stock repurchases in February of this year. We repurchased $170 million of our common stock during the first quarter and 444 million remains available under the new authorization. In 2016 we have invested $1.3 billion in our common stock representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence in our sustainable through cycle strong cash generation. Part of that confidence is based on the high variability of our cost structure within our operating platforms. During market weakness, working capital becomes a funding source. 2015 is a great example. Working capital provided over $500 million to cash flow that year. For the coming months, we expect working capital to also be a source of cash flow for us. For the remainder of the year, we currently are planning the capital investments to be roughly $1.2 billion of which the New Sinton, Texas Steel Mill represents $1 billion. This spending percent is heavily weighted to the second half of 2020 over $700 million of that $1 billion spend is actually meant to be in the second half of this year. As we gain more visibility and see extent of the disruption in 2020 related to the Corona virus, we could shift some of the 2020 investment into 2021 if we believed it was necessary. Based on current timeline, we estimate capital investments for 2021 to be in the range of 700 million to 750 million of which Sinton represents 600 million. We entered the Corona virus crisis in a position of strength with a strong cash position and liquidity profile. Entering 2020 we had over $1.6 billion of cash in short-term investments. At the end of the first quarter, we have almost $1.5 billion. Combined with a $1.2 billion undrawn unsecured revolving credit facility. We have available liquidity of over $2.6 billion. One can\u2019t look historically our financial performance to determine either a trough or a peak future performance. We have grown significantly transformed or Columbus Flat-rolled division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through cycle financial performance. Since 2015 we have increased our total shipping capacity from 11 million tons to over 13 million tons, while increasing our value-added revenues from just over 55% in 2015 to almost 70% last year. Since 2015 we have transformed Columbus\u2019s through cycle earnings capability by reducing their operating costs, dramatically increasing their value-added product capabilities and diversifying our customer base and end market factors. We have expanded our structural in Rail and Roanoke Bar steel divisions to include reinforcing bar production capabilities. Further diversifying the locations product offerings in order to sustain higher through cycle utilization. We have also added new manufacturing businesses to our portfolio that use steel as a raw material providing additional opportunities to sustain our own steel mills utilization throughout market cycles. Since 2015 we have increased the possible internal volume by over 1.5 million tons through acquisitions and growing our steel fabrication platform. This is an incredibly powerful tool during weak demand environments. In addition, collectively, our primary recent and planed strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis. This estimate includes our Sinton Steel Mill and third Columbus galvanizing lines as well as our two operational reinforcing bar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than ever before. We are also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions, comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complimented with a variable share repurchase program during periods of excess cash generation. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. And on a personal note, I want to take just a moment. I want to wish my dad a very happy birthday. He has not listened to one of these calls in 25 years and he is listening this morning and I also want to thank our teams truly for their passion and generosity and the care that they are showing for each other\u2019s health and safety. God bless. Mark? Mark Millett : Well, thank you Theresa. As I stated, safety is and always will be our number one value on priority. Nothing is more important. During the first quarter of this year, our safety performance improved from the previous quarter than it comes with a meaningful improvement in the severity of incidents. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages. As I said many times before, it is not enough. It will never be enough until we reach our goal of zero. We all need to be continuously aware about surroundings and our fellow team members, I challenge all of us to be focused both as we think traditionally of safety, but even more so now as it relates to keeping each other in good health. The steel fabrication platform delivered a strong first quarter performance, construction is also deemed an essential business and as such, almost all the States below construction projects to remain open. We have some jobs delayed or postponed, but at this time it is not being widespread or meaningful. This should be expected as in previous market downturns construction lag the rest of the market by four to six months to pre-funded ongoing projects. We experienced the record number of inquiries and bookings in the first quarter. Our fabrication order backlog remains very strong, but with 15% higher than at this time last year. Our metals recycling team perform well in the quarter returning to profitability. During the first quarter, prime scrap appreciated about $25 or $30 per gross ton probably with lower domestic steel production, April prime scrap prices were tracked at about $30 and shredded $45 per gross ton. Lower industrial prime scrap flow related to the temporary idling of the automotive sector in April was offset by reduced demand due to lower steel mill utilization, maintaining sufficient prime scrap availability. As the announced staggered automotive plant restarts beginning later April and throughout May, we expect to see prime scraps will return to good levels prior to a ramp up in steel mill utilization and thus in turn stable scrap prices. In general, the steel teams had a phenomenal performance in the quarter hitting record volumes in a tough environment. We saw underlying steel demand strength and increased steel - values in those flat-rolled and long steel products through substantially all the first quarter, before the Russia, Saudi Arabia oil price war, as state COVID 19 stay at home directives. Since mid-March the landscape has shifted rapidly. A superior decline in energy prices related to oversupply has significantly reduced steel demand from the pipe and tube manufacturers and the temporary closure of automotive production and the related supply chain closures will meaningfully impact flat-rolled steel demand for this upcoming second quarter. Since mid-March hot rolled coil index pricing has declined over a $100 to about $485 per ton according to plants. As a result of reduced flat-rolled demand and reduced pricing, a considerable number of higher costs flat-rolled steel operations have been indefinitely idled. Since the end of 2019 we believe it represents a reduction of between 12 million to 14 million tons of annual flat-rolled sheets steel capacity, approaching some 20%, 30% of total domestic capability. In contrast the construction sector continues to be steady, which as mentioned is a critical steel consuming representing 40% to 45% of total domestic consumption in normal markets. The order activity from our construction related to customers in addition to the current strength in our steel fabrication and order backlog supports the sentiment. We believe that coming months will be difficult, within these environments the strength of our people and our differentiated business model becomes even more evident and more impactful. As demonstrated historically during times and market inflection, we will likely gain market share based on our uninterrupted low cost operations providing the greatest customer optionality, product end market diversification, the value-added marketing measures and additional internal steel sourcing form our captive manufacturing businesses. To put that in perspective, our still fabrication platform, the Tex, Holland and Vulcan, purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019 and only sourced about a half that from SDI owned steel mills. This provides additional opportunity for internal purchasing to keep our steel mills running at higher utilization rates even in a weaker demand environment. U.S. Administration\u2019s recent guidance for States to begin a staged reopening is positive. As they begin this critical process, improved steel demand will follow some pent up demand from already low steel inventories. We have provided a summary of our recent growth investments on a slide in our invested deck posted on the website. In the last 12 to 18 months we have executed several strategic investments that will benefit our through cycle and earnings and cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of the 440,000 tons of steel rebar production capability providing product diversification and a differentiated supply chain for the customer. Our model provides meaningful customer optionality and flexibility, the significant logistics yield and working capital benefits. This end market diversification provides a high through cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke steel divisions. Heartland Steel 800,000 ton value-add flat-rolled steel processor that sells primarily cold roll and galvanized products has been ramping up nicely. Providing additional support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat-rolled division. This increased the through cycle utilization of our steel assets and broaden our value-added product mix. The acquisition of 75% of the United Steel Supply has been another excellent investment. This flat-rolled, galvanized and pre-painted steel distribution company has provided a meaningful distribution channel to new customers. As a consumer of our internal steel products, they also increase the power of our through cycles steel utilization. Since our acquisition of Columbus Flat-rolled division, the transformation of its product portfolio through the expansion of its value-added steel capability, diversification of its customer base and the addition of the paint line has meaningfully increased its through cycle and its capability which will be clearly demonstrated this downturn. We are now close to completing $140 million, 400,000 ton of value-added fluid galvanizing line which we expect to begin operating mid-2020. The value-added products increase will decrease Columbus\u2019 hot roll coil exposure and provide a ready and waiting hot bank customer base in the side for our new Texas Steel Mill. As symptom, we continue to be excited about the material growth for construction of our new next generation flat-rolled steel mill will deliver. As Theresa explained, our financial strategy focused on entering 2020 providing of the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than any company in the industry and their performance and momentum has been remarkable. In January, we received the required environmental permitting to allow for full construction efforts and we currently anticipate the mid-2021 startup. That said, as Theresa mentioned, we will be reassessing our timeline throughout the second quarter as we gain more visibility into the impact of COVID 19. Additionally, even though we intentionally did not purchase equipment from China, some of our equipment is being manufactured in other countries where the Corona virus is also active. We are having weekly conversations with these manufacturers and we currently do not believe our plan schedule has been meaningfully impacted. The new state of the art Three million ton steel mill will include a value-added coating line comprised of 550,000 ton galvanizing line, and a 250,000 ton paint line with Galvalume capability. We will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steel making facilities with state of the art environmental processes. Our existing steel mills and a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission intensity actually by 12% of average world\u2019s steel making technology, with an 94 inch coil width, one inch thick, 100 KSI product capability. The Texas mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc furnace flat-rolled steel reduces, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model with foreign competition. As you know the steel mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas near Corpus Christi. We have targeted three regional sales markets for the mill representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the Southern and West coast, United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with heavy imports in Houston and the West coast. Our customers are excited to have the regional flat-rolled steel supplier. There is several customers in discussions with one already committed to locate on site with us, and a second close behind, these two customers alone will represent over 800,000 tons of local steel processing and consumption capability. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain options. We believe the potential customer savings related to freight alone are a minimum of $20 to $30 per ton, and for some much higher. This freight advantage along with much shorter lead times provides a differentiated supply chain solution, allowing us to not only be the preferred domestic steel supplier in Southern and Western U.S., but also to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management agreements, much of which is prime. As I mentioned in March, we are also planning to acquire a Mexican scrap company as part of our raw material strategy for Sinton. Their primary operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources through Central and Northern Mexico. The company currently ships approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but as an estimated annual processing capability of about two million tons. After closing, we plan to ramp up volume fairly quickly. We are currently waiting for Mexican regulatory approval, as well as other closing requirements that are expected to close in the coming months. We believe our unique operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating cost effective and highly profitable EAF steel mills positions us incredibly well to successfully execute the Sinton project. As I said before, we are not simply adding flat-rolled production capability. We have a differentiated product offering a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and an import alternative to region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of the long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent, strong cash flow generation and a long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability. Again, our commitment is the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers, and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is simply incredible. I would like to thank each of them for their patience, resilience and commitment during these tough times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us to excel and also a very special thank you to the healthcare providers and their families within steel dynamics, and those serving individuals across the globe. Thank you. Be safe be well. And Michelle, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Chris Terry : Hi Mark and Theresa and thanks for the comments. Just interested in the outlook side or what you have seen so far in April, obviously the chart you provided, your presentation had utilizations in 80%. Mark, you are above the average that fall into the mid-50s in the last couple of weeks. Just wanted if you could comment on how steel days going so far in April and maybe based on your order book, what you might expect that to be during 2Q, I know it is a difficult question, but just wondering if you can provide some color on the ground. Mark Millett : Well, certainly. I think as you said, it is an incredibly difficult question. Not so sure our crystal ball is clearer than others, but I will say that it is positive looking through the lens of our order book and our order input right. I read this morning in American Metal, individuals saying, well, nobody is buying, I guess perhaps they are not buying from other people, but they are buying from us. I believe that obviously energy is going to be very stagnant for the rest of this year into next year. Automotive is going to come back again, one doesn\u2019t necessarily know exactly when, but the expectation is late this month and through May, but the bright spot is certainly is construction. As I mentioned earlier construction tends to lag market downturn, you know we saw it in 2015, we saw it in 2008, 2009. It tends to lag the downturn in the market by about four to six months, because operations or projects tend to be pre-funded and we are seeing that in our new millennium building fabrication business and our structure mill. As I said, new millennium extremely strong backlog despite some project push backs. But there is nothing real meaningful change yet and we are very, very strong, have a large market share in the distribution warehouse market that obviously given people staying at home and the expansion of Amazons and they alike that remains a growth area in all honesty. Structural rail division, backlog is currently solid certainly through May. Did see a $25 price decrease just recently, but I do believe that people will recognize that we are toughing out of the bottom of the market, the scrap is going to be somewhat stable here in the next month or two. So those that have been hanging on the sidelines not buying will likely come to market. In that arena, in the beam arena heavy structural\u2019s distribution is certainly slowed as they whittled down their inventories, they are now prism tight and we are starting to see them come back and buy as they need. The fabricators, that business is still strong as they supply the ongoing construction projects. The rail is actually very, very strong for us at the - rail division and rebar is an addition for us. Compared to past downturns, the product portfolio of structural rail division is much more diverse today and we won\u2019t see the debt of low utilization rate. And if you remember back in 2009, 2010 that business went to 30%, 35% utilization, still remaining somewhat profitable. But that is not going to happen this time. It is a much more diversified product one can make and so that should whether this along very, very well. Engineered bar that is seeing a little softness right there. Obviously automotive is down, energy too is down there and so that is one arena that is probably as soft as anything going on in our product portfolio.  Flat-rolled remains relatively robust, is probably too strong word. But, would tug in those operations to run around about 80%. utilization. That for us seems to be a good balance between fixed costs absorption and pricing. And it appears that we should be able to sustain that targeted output certainly for April, certainly for May, and we were confident that we can do that in June as well. So generally, I think it is obviously quarter-over-quarter. It is going to be a tough couple of months for us. But we are positive. Chris Terry : Okay, thanks. Thanks for call Mark. I will leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Gagliano : Hi thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a solid start to obviously a challenging year. I just want to follow-up on the prior question. If we look at, Slide 11, 94% utilization rates in the first quarter. What is that number today? Theresa Wagler : Dave, I think that is what Mark just really tried to address. So we have not - there are a couple of things that I think differentiates us. One is that we continue to operate 24x7. And so with that, we get the orders and we gain market share during environment like this, especially as others, higher cost production is being shut down. Right now, we are still operating at a very good utilization rate across the platform. The most challenged division frankly is our engineered bar division. And that is because they are tied to both the energy market and to just general industrial. Once automotive comes back and more specifically for engineered bar, in Caterpillar, John deere, et cetera, start to operating again and I think that scheduled, the last chart sizing was toward the mid the end of May, you just start to see that crack. But that being said, it is a very difficult environment. It is just we are able to gain market share. And we are very nimble in order entry and working with the customers and that tends to make it lot in very difficult environments, our utilization stays higher. The other point is the internal volume that is not to be overlooked. So fabrication is still incredibly strong with a record backlog. They need steel, they will be buying that steel from our own steel mills. The same thing with regarding to our internal processing divisions, so Heartland, United Steel Supply, et cetera. They need steel, they will be buying that from our internal steel mills. So that helps our utilization profile and not - most of our - if any of our competitors have that same lever to pull. So we can\u2019t give you an exact percentage number today. Frankly, I don\u2019t know what the exact percentage would be overall, but I know that we feel good about where we are and that the teams are doing a great job. David Gagliano : Okay, thanks for the additional color. The commentary was targeting 80% on the flat side, how about - you know is there a target for the remainder of the year in the product mix? Mark Millett : Well, I think structural should remain in that sort of 75% to 80% range. Again, the merchant shapes, probably less than that. Again, merchant shapes around tend not to be a massive part of our earnings profile anyway, but three out of four of our principal mills Butler, Columbus and Structural Rail Division are targeting that 75% to 80% utilization rate. As Theresa said, engineered bar right now looks pretty softer than that. Theresa Wagler : So Dave just as an example, if you go back to 2015, which I would suggest is last week on steel environment, that we have seen the overall, generally our operations even at that time we are operating at over 70%, on the flat-rolled side they were actually operating closer to 90%. It is always more challenging in the long product side, because there is just extra capacity out in the system as it relates to long products and because they are all electric-arc furnace based. But today we would suggest that we just have more internal levers to pull. And so we wouldn\u2019t think that necessarily overall when you grew both flat and long has as much impact as it might have at one point in time. David Gagliano : Okay, I will leave it at that. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Good morning Mark and Theresa, thanks for taking my question. With regards to the cost performance that we have seen in the business, as you continued to grow your processing volumes, utilizing some internal and some third-party substrate, can you give us a sense of how that\u2019s impacting your overall fixed cost base for the business? Again, if we think about how you are positioned in 2020 compared to past downturns, should we consider the growth and processing is essentially more verbalizing your cost base versus history or should we think about this in a different way perhaps. And then secondly, just one more follow-up with regards to Sinton, I wonder if you can please give a little bit of color with regards to decision to continue with the same three million ton target, given the weakness in oil and gas yourself, how did that being weak trough 2021, and plan for one million times going into energy. How do we think about that three million ton target in the current market environment versus the dynamics. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Okay. Seth, good morning. I think I have all the questions written down. So the first question is about the adding of the manufacturing businesses or the processing businesses, there is two points that you should keep in mind. One is, you are correct, it is encrypting the variability of our cost structures, but again, as a reminder, each of our operating platforms is already over 85% variable cost, but this helps that as well. The other component to recognize is that because they are buying steel and using steel as a substrate that is impacting our cost of goods sold by having steel run through cost of goods sold, which is higher priced. And so just anecdotally, in the first quarter, we had about 15% of our cost of goods sold was associated with those steel purchases from the converting companies. From a Sinton perspective Mark, I will let you handle the, the energy question. Mark Millett : Yes, for sure. I think that the mill is structured or designed for three million tons is not like a conventional since based EAF where you have two casters, this has one caster with a three million ton capability. And as such it is not a matter of doing half the plant or anything like that. Nor do we would be defensive about doing so. Obviously the export would be adjusted somewhat to demand, but again the energy market are pretty tougher at this time. But as one - for those that have been in the industry for a significant amount of time things do cycle, that their market will come back. But the advantage of the Sinton facility is its geographic location, we are not dependent on one single market product. We have got around about 27 million tons of market capability. When you look at the Southwest. You look at the West Coast and you look at Mexico. And we can ship that product between energy and automotive and construction. And we feel that the investment premise remains totally, totally intact. Theresa Wagler : And as just a quick point on that, from an energy perspective last year, I think there are other shipments, about 7% was related to energy. But that was primarily at our engineered bar division at Columbus. So within that number, we also shipped quite a bit of volume from our steel, West Virginia facility into solar. So our energy number also includes solar and solar is still something that is actually increasing in demand during this time as well. Seth Rosenfeld : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning, and hope everyone is healthy and safe. Mark Millett : Likewise, Timna. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Timna Tanners : Thank you. I wanted to just drill down a little bit into your cash flow philosophy. So I heard you - maybe Theresa, I misheard. Can you clarify you said for the remainder of the year CapEx is 1.2 billion which sounds like your CapEx forecast is intact at 1.4 billion or did I hear that wrong. If and you also went on to say that you could adjust it if needed, but you are not adjusting it. And you also said that you just authorized further buybacks and just completed what is it 170 million buybacks in the quarter. So I kind of get the impression that now Steel Dynamics is operating as if the impact of reduced demand and COVID-19 impact is a shorter term phenomenon and kind of getting back to normal later in the year? That is what I\u2019m piecing together from your comments on the CapEx and then the buybacks. But I just wanted a little bit more thought on how you are thinking philosophically about the rest of the year and CapEx and buyback? Thanks. Theresa Wagler : Great. So let me clarify, you are right concerning the capital expenditures currently for 2020. We started the year saying, we expect you to spend about 1.4, we spent a little over 200 million in the first quarter. So for the remainder of the year, there is 1.2 billion mark, of that 1.2 billion, over 700 million of that is actually late in the second half of the year and it is related to Sinton. As we progress Timna through the second quarter, we believe we are going to gain a lot of visibility as a state, for lack of a better word reopen on what that means for steel consumption and on our own operations for the remainder of 2020. As we progress to the second quarter, should we think that we want to potentially take some of that capital and push it into 2021. We can make that decision to do that at that time. But right now, from what we are seeing, as Mark mentioned, how the mills are operating and the market share and the activity that we are seeing, we don\u2019t believe that that decision is something that we are making today. As it relates to our share repurchases. We repurchased 107 million in the first quarter. Most of that was purchased within January and February timeframe, but you should expect to see from us in the second quarter, is that we will be watching the markets, watching the impact of the Corona virus and you will see us heavily into the share buyback market at that point in time and then we will reassess for the second half of the year. The reason the Board authorized an additional 500 million in February of this year is simply because we think share repurchases during periods of excess cash flow is an important tool to have and so we wanted to have that tool, because we actually only had I think about $40 million to $50 million left on a previous program. Does that help clarify how we are thinking about things? Timna Tanners : Yes, absolutely. Because I was having a difficult time squaring some of those comments with the market environment. Okay. So I guess just as a follow-up if I could, can you just talk a little bit about when you think you will have more visibility on construction? So like you said, construction is late cycle. You wouldn\u2019t see cancellations yet on that, but it sounds like that could start to flow through later in a year. I just wanted to get a little bit more thought on when you would start to see any impact on your backlog or any commentary from what you are seeing on the ground level because we are hearing that private sector activity is kind of drying up. So I\u2019m just wondering if that is in-line with what you are hearing as well. Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, Timna I have seen the same commentary and it seems to be a little disconnected to higher actual order book and what we have seen, and as I have said quite consistently, our real lens for SDI is through that order book and through the inquiry, right. And all that remains quite strong. The analogy, if you look at the 2008, 2009 downturn, which was pretty significant onto itself, we saw the structural rail division offering pretty consistently into the summer of 2009. That was a good four, five, six months of strong sort of continuation from pre-funded projects and we are seeing as I said - a large part of our business is in the distribution warehouse arena and that is, I would say is expanding more than contracting. So I think we see things optimistically. We were also very, very realistic and I just want to go back to what you are saying about is there a dichotomy between the markets and what was saying relative to a strategy. But I\u2019m going to ramble a little bit, I think, but you know, probably some of the members of the SDI team been in the business probably longer than anyone on the call and probably mostly leadership in steel companies. And we have seen the 80, 81, we lived through and managed through 2001, 2002, when 45% of the industry was in insolvency through 2008, 2009. We lived through 2015. So we are very realistic and recognize the impact in the market change and manage to that. And I think we have demonstrated through our 25, 26 year history, that we are very intentional, we are very disciplined, and we are actually conservative. At that same time and in periods like this, leaders and you have got one of the best leadership teams in the world here. They need to lead, they shouldn\u2019t be seeking cover, we need to be seeking opportunity. And that is where we think Sinton is a very, very good investment, a very good opportunity, and we will continue to go down that path. That being said, just to reemphasize what Theresa said, we are continuing to reassess our order books, the market, cash flow generation, and we will adjust as we see fit. But I think it is very, very important to recognize that. Again, a lot of the CapEx for Sinton is through the back end toward the end of the year here. And it is a huge lever that we can pull if necessary. Timna Tanners : Okay. And by lever you mean to delay right? I don\u2019t envision you are talking about, like you pulling it per say, right? Theresa Wagler : No, what we are just talking about delaying it Timna. Timna Tanners : Right. Theresa Wagler : And one other point, and - you really can\u2019t forget the strength of the working capital for us. And the funding sources it can be if necessary. Timna Tanners : Okay. Really helpful, guys. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from our line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Hey. Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Theresa Wagler : Good morning. Phil Gibbs : Mark, can you talk a little bit about the onsite customers that you are going to have on Sinton, I think it was part of your script on Sinton, but I just wanted to be sure because I think you have said over 800,000 tons of local are onsite processing and obviously that is a big chunk of the three million tons that you are looking to get? So one, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly and two where do you think that can go as this project evolves? Mark Millett : Well, I think we have got one sign and a second very, very, very close to signing. There is a preference on their part not to submit names at this moment in time. But you are right, the two of them would amount to about 800,000 tons of consumption and processing capability. We probably have another - not probably, we do have four other interested customers that have been given full packages, lease packages and those sorts of things. They just slowed a little bit because of the situation we are in. But we are confident that we are going to get those folks to. But it is a very I think important part of the overall strategy at that note. Theresa Wagler : Collectively, it is likely to be somewhere over a one million tons of onsite capability. Phil Gibbs : Okay. Well that is helpful. So talking, basically a third kind of built in onsite there. I think that there are tax benefits or deferrals or accelerated depreciation on years where new assets go into service. Let us just say 2021 is intact for Sinton at least as it is today. What should we be thinking about the size of just the accelerated depreciation, you know benefits in terms of tax avoidance in the year, it goes into service, because obviously with two billion of spending it could be pretty meaningful. Theresa Wagler : You know, so we don\u2019t have exact numbers, but I would estimate that of the $1.9 billion, you are likely to have accelerated depreciation on at least 80% to 85% of that number. Phil Gibbs : Okay. Would you take that all in year one? I guess all the assets go into service in 2021? Theresa Wagler : Yes. So that would all be recorded in 2021 year sort of. Phil Gibbs : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Well thank you very much and good morning. I hope you guys all well. Just two quick questions from me, first of all on oil, obviously this week\u2019s oil volatility, how do you guys think about that? Just aside from what it could do to investment in the energy sector on tubular steel and so on and so forth. You know when you kind of saw what happened yesterday to price is what kind of went through your mind in terms of are there any opportunities for steel dynamics that we should be thinking about and what are the less obvious challenges as well? So maybe just give a little framework, if you will, around how you are kind of thinking about the oil price move yesterday. And I guess the second question is more on construction. Can you give a little bit more granularity there? When we look at the residential and non-residential construction numbers, there seems to be as much weakness as the restraints and has been for the last year also. You guys seems to be exposed to the strength of it. So could you give a little bit more granularities where are you seeing that strength in any particular areas? Is it res or non-res, you know, geographically more South than North and so on. That would be very helpful. Thank you very much. Mark Millett : Well, certainly well regarding the energy markets. I think yesterday it was quite incredible and I\u2019m not so sure we have had time to digest. But just in general, obviously the immediate impact is on the energy markets, pipe and tube. And that was, that is not just a COVID thing, that obviously is Russia and Saudi Arabia doing that thing. And the low energy prices will expand the downturn there that is 8% to 10%, I guess of the steel market in normal times. But we looked at that as a pretty stagnant market rest of the year going into this year and next year, first half of next year anyway. I guess the positive, well one is scrap tends to move down with oil, not for sure that the physical markets would allow that to occur in May, we are looking - perhaps shouldn\u2019t move down in May, but we think given the physical market, it is probably a sideways market moving forward, but that may change here in the next week or two. What I do think is that the pressure on the energy market is going on in turn put pressure on the integrated mills. And I think that you have seen a pretty dramatic idling of integrated capacity, last one is capacity here over the last four or five, six weeks. And if you look back over a longer period, you know the last couple of years, there has been a much more frequent turn-on, turn-off of some of that capacity as they suffer pretty strong economic pressure. And I think a sustained downturn in the energy markets will make some of those assets - it is going to be a tough decision that ever bring them back. But I think it may as a positive may help rationalize the industry to some small degree. Sorry. And then you had the second question on construction granularity. Again, there certainly has been weakness in the northeast, but that has tended to be more projects or construction locations actually being shut down by the states. We certainly see strength in fact. We certainly, as I said see strength in that distribution warehouse arena. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gordon Johnson with GLJ Research. Please proceed with your question. Gordon Johnson : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. This question may have been asked, but I was wondering if I could get a little bit more color on your shipments expected across some of the different lines, know you said your utilization had dropped to 75%, 80%, can we get maybe a little more color on kind of what you see in Q2, and maybe some of the green shoots you see in a second half? Theresa Wagler : No we are not going to get too specific for two different reasons. One is that we generally don\u2019t give that type of guidance. And the second reason is especially going into the environment that we are in right now, there is not a lot of visibility. And so we want to make sure that we are being appropriate. But I think what Mark was suggesting is that we intend to see utilization, or at least we are planning for utilization, higher flat-rolled operations, somewhere in that 75% to 80% range and traditionally even in 2015, we were actually operated about 90%. So, we generally gain market share in flat-rolled during periods of weakness. And we are seeing that today as well. And we don\u2019t see a driver for that to change throughout the quarter. Along product side is more difficult. So in the structural and rail arena, we expect to maintain higher utilization in that 75% to 80% range because of the order backlog as it sits today, and because construction is continuing for us in that arena, and with the addition of rail, and rebar that product diversification helps our facility. Across the other long product mill, it is more difficult. So you are going to see the most weakness in our mind and the special bar quality or the SBQ arena. And then, that is distributed throughout. So that is probably about as much clarity or granularities we can provide the volumes at this point. Gordon Johnson : Okay, that is helpful. And then one last one, in the checks we have done, it seems like you guys are doing quite well in the construction space, particularly against the integrated mills. Is there any I guess approach you guys have or color you can provide on I guess incremental attempts to share that space? Is that accurate that you guys are doing quite well in the construction space against your integrated peers and thanks for the question. Theresa Wagler : Yes. No that is absolutely correct especially - I don\u2019t know if it wasn\u2019t just impurities like this in the first quarter, our structural rail team did a fantastic job on the construction side and pulling in volume. And if you are speaking more specifically about our fabrication business, we have been gaining market share in that arena as well and the team is doing incredibly well. And Mark point out is more specifically in that warehouse arena, but we have been taking market share and we would expect to continue to do that. Gordon Johnson : Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank.  Please proceed with your question. Sean Wondrack : Hi, Mark and Theresa, and thank you very much for all the information today. Just to look at the auto market, you know I think you had mentioned that some of the auto manufacturers are looking to come back online in the next few weeks. Can you talk about like are you starting to hear from them more like more order inquiry and also sort of for the industry I realize you guys are a great operator and you are going to have the ability to potentially take share this year. What is sort of your baseline, if you have one yet, a baseline forecast for auto production do you assume 10% this year, curious about that. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : The question relates to automotive and it relates to the perspective of as they start to roll on and we have been taking market share specifically with the European auto makers, et cetera, would we expect to continue to take that market share and what are we thinking about from a volume perspective? So how much will fuel consumption volumes or auto builds from another perspective and how much will that be down if they get to one million to 1.5 million is what I\u2019m seeing. And then the perspective just around what do we feel about continuing to take that market share related to automotive. Mark Millett : Got it okay. Well I would suggest that as I said earlier, my crystal ball is probably no better than anyone else\u2019s on the call and not the whole recovery is subject to when folks get back into the marketplace and at what speed do they ramp up. From present information it appears that automotive will stop rolling back during the end of the mid to end of next week and all the way through May depending on which company, there is a backlog of vehicles, right the second so how quick recovery is difficult to gauge. You look at a past troughs it tends to replenish - they have been in position to replenish inventory and pent up demand. I\u2019m not so sure we will see that this time around. To qualify our gain in market share is relative to time is a tough thing, but all I can say is the facilities are sort of armed and ready to go. And it is our flexibility across all markets. It is not just the auto, but all markets that allows us to take off opportunistic gains. It is going to be a while before the integrated mills just saw turning on all their idled capacity. One would imagine that they need to see some visibility and transparency for a market that is only has got positive momentum, and their pricing also has positive momentum. And that is not going to happen just because the automotive - one or two [indiscernible] brought up. So there is that time period and it is a matter of months and maybe longer at this time around, who knows, but it is a matter of months where the flexibility of electric-arc-furnace operations can take advantage of the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please proceed with your question. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. How much of the Butler and Columbus mill tonnage used to be scalp for welded to for energy exploration and in the plan for Sinton? And should we just assume that those volumes become construction steels given the short-term crude oil outlook? Mark Millett : Well John, I would say Butler, the energy scalp is not a massive part of their portfolio. And so we tend to see hot roll coil dependence fully is not really related to the oil and gas and given the value-add diversification there, we don\u2019t really have a massive amount of hotline to sell to be honest. Columbus, certainly has greater exposure. And if you remember when we purchased the mill in 2014 that was a dominantly an energy pipe supplier, and I think back then it was 30% maybe 40% of its output. Theresa Wagler : It was over 40% energy. Mark Millett : Since then the team really catalyzed by the downturn in energy in 2015. The team has done a phenomenal job diversifying that asset, adding greater towing capabilities, adding paint line, adding a variety of high strength type of great steel there, getting into automotive, getting into Mexico. So, both the product and the market diversification there has totally transformed the entity. And so it is through sight learning today, there is nothing like that 2015 as much higher. That being said, it is probably 10%, maybe 15% energy related. Theresa Wagler : So John, just overall, to put a point on it. Last year our shipments we only had 7% that were related across the company that were related to energy. And some of that included solar. So that was a high premium grade in OCTG that sort of thing. So it is not that much of our business, either last year or today at this point. And then as it relates to Sinton, we will also be competing we think very effectively with imports and I think that is something that people should recognize as well. John Tumazos : Thank you. Congratulations on being the old man in the call Mark, I can simply tie wherever you want. Mark Millett : I will be respectful, but you and I both know. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBank Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Hey Theresa, could you provide the mix of sheet products as typical? Theresa Wagler : I apologize, Phil. I didn\u2019t. I have it here though. So for flat-rolled shipment, I know a lot of you use it for your models, our hot-rolled coil and our pickled in oil shipments were 891,000 tons, our cold rolled shipments where 151,000 tons and our coated shipments were 948,000 tons for a total of 1,990,000 tons. Apologies. Phil Gibbs : No worries. That is all. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please proceed with your question. Charles Bradford : Good morning and I have got both of you guys beat on age, but the question goes down to a little bit coming maybe out of your bailiwick, but apparently U.S. deal has dropped out of membership of the AISI that may impact the quality of the industry data that we get. Have you seen any change in the quality? I\u2019m thinking especially of the usually pretty bad operating rate figures. Mark Millett : Chuck, I would say we have not seen any change that nor have we analyzed it to be honest. Charles Bradford : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Kenyon with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Tyler Kenyon : Hey, good morning Mark and Theresa, I hope you are both doing well. Theresa, just a quick one for me, do you anticipate any relief in 2020 from the recently passed Cares Act, payroll tax deferrals, enhanced deductibility of interest expense, et cetera. In any way to bracket what kind of cash when relief they could provide in 2020. Theresa Wagler : Yes. Given the analysis that we have done, I really can\u2019t put a great bracket around it, but at this point in time, Tyler it is not something that we are viewing as will be significant for us. There is definitely the payroll tax relief would have an impact, but apart from that given our expectations on operating in the different areas they are helping either smaller companies or companies that are not doing as well as we are. I don\u2019t think it is going to be something that is meaningful at this point. If that changes, we will be sure to let you know. Tyler Kenyon : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you Michelle and thank you everyone on the call. I just would like to emphasize, I\u2019m a pretty optimistic guy and if you were surrounded by the team we have at SDI, you would have that same optimism. And it is really based on SDI\u2019s position. And I suggest even in these tough times, and the SDI team shines in moments of challenge and we are in a position of strength. Our business model is built to be resilient in tough markets. We have a high variable cost structure, 85% of our cost structure is variable. We got a broad value-added product portfolio, and we have strong pull through volume, as we have suggested from our internal downstream operations. All that builds a high utilization rate we have demonstrated in every trough higher utilization rates than our competition. And when you have capital intense deal assets, volume is absolutely critical. And that translates into better financial metrics that to cycle. So we are still confident in our cash generation capability. We are still confident in our financial foundation and we are battling each and every day, but our orders continue to flow in. So we do remain positive. That being said, we are incredibly intentional. And we recognize that we need to be assessing markets and our position almost each and every day. We have demonstrated that in the past and we will demonstrate that going forward. So for all of you. Thank you for being on the call. Customers and employees seriously, thank you, you make SDI who we are today, and everyone be healthy, be safe. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. We certainly appreciate and value your time with us this morning, especially during these uncharted circumstances. Leaders are tasked to make decisions today that have not been required in recent history, regarding the health and the safety of our people, their families and our communities. We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and are continuing to operate safely. None of our operations have been impacted to-date. As always, protecting the health and welfare of our teams is our highest priority. I want to thank each of our 8,400 team members for their passion and continued dedication to excellence. I am incredibly proud to work alongside each of them during this unprecedented time. They are a special group, accomplishing extraordinary things and we are committed to them, their families, and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. But before I continue, Theresa, will you provide insights into our outstanding second quarter performance? Theresa Wagler : Absolutely. Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being here. Our second quarter 2020 net income was $75 million or $0.36 per diluted share, above our guidance of $0.29 per share to $0.33 per share due to stronger than anticipated flat-rolled steel shipments. Our second quarter results were reduced by the following two items, costs related to our June 2020 refinancing activities of approximately $0.08 per diluted share, and costs net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our new Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill of approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding these two items, second quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.47 per diluted share above our adjusted guidance of $0.40 per share to $0.44 per share. One comment before proceeding, yes, the comparability of second quarter 2020 financial results to sequential or prior year amount is unfavorable, but to achieve what our teams have achieved in this unchartered environment, as Mark mentioned, is simply incredible. Steel and ferrous scrap demand declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting temporary closures of numerous steel consuming businesses. As a result, our second quarter 2020 revenues were $2.1 billion, 19% lower than first quarter sequential results and 24% lower than prior year sales. Our second quarter 2020 operating income was $159 million, over 40% lower than those sequential first quarter and prior year results. From an operating platform perspective, our steel operations delivered an outstanding performance during this challenging time. Second quarter steel shipments of 2.5 million tons were only 12% lower than the record 2.8 million tons achieved in the sequential first quarter of this year and only 9% lower than prior year\u2019s second quarter. Our steel mills operated almost 80% of their capability, while the rest of the domestic industry operated at 55%. Due to the momentum in the first quarter, our steel shipments in the first half of 2020 are only 2% lower than in 2019. Our ability to maintain higher steel volumes is a result of our value-added highly diversified product offering, our supply chain differentiation and our internal manufacturing businesses, a sincere congratulation to the entire team. However, steel prices deteriorated, our average quarterly realized sales price decreased $19 per ton to $755 in the second quarter, while average scrap cost decreased only $1 per ton resulting in steel metal margin compression. The result was second quarter 2020 operating income of $172 million for our steel operations, 41% lower than the sequential first quarter. As states issued shelter-in-place mandate and domestic manufacturing slowed, scrap supply and collection declined. This in combination with lower domestic steel production caused weak ferrous scrap demand. As a result, our metals recycling operations recorded an operating loss of $6 million for the second quarter of 2020 but they remained cash flow positive. Our metals recycling operations provide a competitive advantage to sourcing ferrous scrap for our steel mills, allowing for increased scrap quality, melt efficiency and reduction of company-wide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. For our Steel Fabrication business, second quarter 2020 operating income remained strong at $27 million, compared to sequential results of $29 million due to steady shipments. We continue to experience a strong backlog and customers remain constructive considering non-residential construction projects. Our cash generation continues to be very strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2020, we generated $486 million of cash flow from operations, representing our second best quarterly performance. As we stated on last quarter\u2019s call, during weaker environment, our working capital can be a meaningful funding source and it was in the second quarter, generating over $290 million of cash flow. For the first half of 2020, we generated $697 million of cash flow from operations, representing a record first half performance. We also invested $527 million in fixed asset, of which $371 million was invested in our new Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. We also maintained our cash dividend at 25% -- $0.25 per share in the second quarter after increasing a 4% in the first quarter of this year. During the first half of 2020, we have repurchased $107 million of our common stock and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. In June, we also took advantage of the capital market and executed our second investment grade notes offering issuing $400 million of 2.4% notes due in 2025 and $500 million of 3.25% notes due in 2031. These transactions were leveraged neutral and proceeds were used to repay two tranches of our then existing higher cost high yield notes, combined with our December inaugural investment grade refinancing, we have extended our overall debt maturity profile and lowered our effective interest rate to under 4%. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence in our sustainable through-cycle strong cash generation. For the second half of 2020, we currently are planning for capital investments to be roughly between $800 million and $850 million, of which our new Texas Steel Mill represents $700 million to $750 million of that range. We estimate capital investments for the full year of 2021 to also be in the range of $700 million to $750 million with the Texas Mill representing about $580 million of that amount, as their operations are expected to begin mid-year 2021. We entered 2020 a position of strength with a strong cash position and available liquidity of $2.8 billion and we have remained in a position of strength as we have maintained that liquidity with cash and short-term investments of $1.6 billion and our $1.2 billion fully available revolving credit facility. One can\u2019t look historically at our financial performance to determine either a future trough or peak. We have grown significantly, transformed our Columbus Flat Roll Division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through-cycle financial performance. We have also added new manufacturing businesses to our portfolio that use steel as a raw material, providing additional opportunities to sustain our steel mills\u2019 utilization in a weaker market cycle. In addition, collectively, our primary recent and planned strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through-cycle historical spread basis. You can see that on a slide in our second quarter investor deck. I believe it\u2019s slide 13. This estimate includes our Texas Steel Mill, the third galvanizing line at Columbus, which has just recently started and our two rebar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than we have ever been before. We are also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that\u2019s complemented with a variable share repurchase program when appropriate. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of a sustainable optimized long-term value creation. I know that some of you actually model some more specificity within our flat roll group shipments, so I will provide those for you now. During the second quarter, we had flat-rolled shipments representing hot roll coil and pickled and oiled of 746,000 tons, we had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 tons and we had coated shipments of 900,000 tons, representing 1,778,000 tons in the second quarter in totality. And finally, on a personal note, I just want to sincerely thank the teams for their passion and their generosity, and the care that they are showing for one another\u2019s health and safety. It truly is tremendous. So, thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Theresa. As I have mentioned many times in the past, safety is and is always going to be our number one value because nothing is more important. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages. But as I have said also many times before, it\u2019s not enough, our goal is to have zero injuries across the company and we will continue to strive for that. Our safety performance has further improved during the last 12 months, with our second quarter results continuing the positive trend. We all must be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members. I challenge all of us to be focused both in the traditional sense, but even more so now, as it relates to keeping one another in good health. The steel fabrication platform delivered a strong second quarter performance. Our fabrication order backlog remains strong and is higher than it was at this time last year. Customers remain constructive concerning non-residential construction projects. We have had some jobs delayed or postponed, but it\u2019s not been widespread or material. We anticipate the strength remaining through the rest of this year and expect second half 2020 volume is being equal if not higher than the first half performance. In contrast, as states issued shelter-in-place mandates and domestic manufacturing slowed, scrap supply and collection declined. In particular, prime scrap flow decreased considerably as automotive production ground to an abrupt halt. In addition, significantly lower second quarter domestic steel production utilization, which was estimated at 55% across the industry, resulted in weak ferrous scrap demand. As a result, our metals recycling operations were cash flow positive in the second quarter, but incurred losses at the operating level. As states have started to reopen, scrap flows have improved and we expect our metals recycling platform to return to profitability for the second half of 2020 based on increased volume. The steel team had a tremendous performance in this environment. After record shipments in the first quarter of this year, our volume only decreased 12% in the second quarter. I\u2019d like to commend our commercial teams and the support of our customers for making this happen ad thank you to the metals recycling team for providing the raw materials required to achieve this level of production in what became a very tight market. The strength of our differentiated business model coupled with the passion of our people drove strong steel mill production utilization to almost 80% across the company. While the overall domestic industry, as I said, only operated at 55%. Meaningfully, our flat roll operations achieved utilization of almost 90% in the quarter. As COVID-19 and related state closure implications unfolded in late March through today, steel demand and selling values decreased rapidly from the strength seen in much of the first quarter of this year. Temporary closure of automotive production and the related supply chain closures meaningfully reduced flat-rolled steel demand. The severe decline in energy prices related to oversupply significantly reduced steel demand from steel pipe and tube manufacturers. However, construction-related steel demand was more resilient. Our Structural and Rail Division maintained utilization of over 70% in the second quarter. As a result of reduced flat-rolled steel demand and lower pricing, a considerable number of high cost flat-rolled steel operations came offline since the end of 2019. We believe about 15 million tons or so of flat-rolled sheet capacity has been idled, representing over 20% of annual domestic production capacity. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our superior business model become even more evident. As demonstrated in the second quarter and historically, during periods of market inflection, we maintain higher utilization levels than our peers and gain market share. Uninterrupted low cost operations, provides the greatest customer optionality. Our broad product portfolio and end market diversification within value-added market niches drives flexibility for our commercial teams. Superior supply chain solutions create additional value for our customers, making us a preferred place to shop. And furthermore, a powerful driver is the optionality of internal steel sourcing from our captive manufacturing businesses, which we call pull-through volume. To put this in perspective, our steel fabrication platform and steel processing locations purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019. Only about half of this volume is typically sourced from the SDI-owned steel mills, but in difficult markets, we increase the percentage.  As states continue to determine their reopening guidelines and many steel consuming businesses have resumed operations. We anticipate steel demand will materially improve from the second quarter trough. The automotive sector and its related supply chain have restarted production, and we have started to see some resulting increase in steel demand. The construction sectors remain more resilient and related steel demand has been steady, as evidenced by our Structural and Rail Division volume and steel fabrication customer backlog. The order activity from our construction-related customers, combined with the strength in our steel fabrication order backlog, support our optimism for a continued strength through the rest of the year. The weaker sectors continue to be related to energy and general and industrial consumers, which are likely to require a slightly longer recovery period. Related to continued growth, we provided a summary update of our recent growth investments on our slide in our investor deck posted on the SDI website. In the last 12 months or 24 months, we have executed several strategic investments that have or will benefit our through-cycle earnings and cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of 440,000 tons of steel rebar production capability, providing product diversification and differentiated supply chain for the customer. Our model provides a meaningful customer optionality and flexibility, with significant logistics, yield and working capital benefits. This end market diversification provides the higher through-cycle utilization for our Structural and Roanoke Steel divisions. We continue to expand capacity at Heartland Steel. It is an 800,000-ton value-added flat-rolled steel processor and the team has been operating at record coating levels, providing additional internal production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll Division, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel assets and broadening our value-added product mix. The acquisition of 75% of United Steel Supply has been an excellent investment in addition to our portfolio. As a local distributor of pre-painted construction product, it has provided a meaningful channel to new and more diversified customers. With our customer-preferred co-branded supply chain and more rurally located custom base, and recent stimulus dollars flowing these communities, United Steel Supply achieved record second quarter shipments. We anticipate the strength to continue through the rest of this year. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll Division, we have meaningfully increased its through-cycle earnings capability. We have transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of its value-added steel capabilities, the diversification of its customer base and the addition of a paint line. In a few weeks ago, the team achieved another milestone. They coated their first prime galvanized coil on our new 400,000 ton line. Columbus now has for value-added coating lines. The investment reduces Columbus\u2019 hot-rolled coil exposure and provides a ready hot band consumer base in the south for our new Texas Flat Roll Mill when it starts operating in less than a year from now. We remain incredibly excited about on our new next-generation flat mill in Texas and its certain contribution to our growth and earnings capability. As Theresa explained, our strategy focused on entering 2020 from a point of financial strength, providing for the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experienced than exist in any other company in the industry. The Texas\u2019 team\u2019s performance and momentum have been absolutely remarkable. Construction is going extremely well and within our expanded capital cost of $1.9 billion. We expect the operations to begin in mid-2021. We are having weekly conversations with the equipment suppliers regarding the impact of COVID-19. I don\u2019t believe our planned schedule has been meaningfully impacted thus far. The new state-of-the-art 3-million-ton steel mill will include two value-added coating lines comprised of a 550,000-ton galvanizing line and a 250,000-ton paint line. It will follow the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities with state-of-the-art, environmental controls and processes. Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average world\u2019s steelmaking technology, less than 15% of the average producer. With an 84-inch coil width and up to 1-inch thick 100 ksi product, the Texas Mill will have capabilities beyond existing electric-arc furnace flat-rolled steel producers and will compete even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The mill is strategically located in Sinton, Texas near Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional sales markets for the Sinton Steel Mill, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the Southern and West Coast United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with the heavy imports in Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have two customers now committed to locate on site with us, representing over 800,000 tons of annual consumption -- processing and consumption capability. We still have others in conversation and would expect to have further volume in the next months. Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to their current supply chain options. This freight advantage along with much shorter lead times provides a superior supply chain solution, allowing us to not only be the preferred domestic steel supply in the South and Western U.S., but also to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative pricing risk. From a raw material perspective, our metals recycling operations already control a significant and growing scrap volume in Mexico through scrap management relationships, much of which is needed prime scrap. As announced earlier this year, we are also planning to acquire a Mexican scrap company as part of our raw materials strategy for Sinton. Their primary operation is strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. The company currently ships approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually but have estimated annual process and capability of almost 2 million tons. After the acquisition is finalized in the coming months, we plan to ramp up that volume quickly. We believe our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience and successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets positions us incredibly well to successfully execute the transformational Texas growth investment. As I have said before, we are not simply adding flat-rolled production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and offer an import alternative to a region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability. I believe you would all agree this was clearly demonstrated this past quarter. Again, our commitment is to the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is incredible. I would like to thank each of them for their patience, their resilience and commitment during these uncharted times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us all to excellence. Additionally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and their families within Steel Dynamics and those serving individuals across the world. So, on behalf of SDI, thank you all, be safe, be well. And Laura, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question. Chris Terry : Hi, Mark and Theresa, and thanks for taking my question. The main thing I wanted to talk about was the market share gains in 2Q, just wanted if you could talk about that on a more granular level, obviously, you had high utilization rates with some of the blast furnaces offline. Just thinking about it though on a sort of a customer basis, is it the broader offerings, the better service, just because the blast furnaces are offline. I just wondered if you could talk about that and then further opportunities, just thinking about it whether it\u2019s sort of step changes or gradual improvements and other opportunities there, obviously, you have got Sinton, which you can get more gains in a year or so, but just thinking about the next couple of quarters? Mark Millett : I guess that, obviously, that you just, sorry. I got to unmute myself there. You missed the best part. No. I think, as we have always demonstrated in the past, in moments of inflection down and tough markets, we continue to gain market share. And again, I want to emphasize, yeah, our shipments were down 12%. The 12% from a record, record production level in Q1. So it\u2019s an absolutely incredible performance by the team and I think that the fact that we are fully engaged, fully operational, obviously, allows our customer base to access products, particularly when they are constrained in their own inventories. We just allow them to continue and they have got confidence in us. What we are here to deliver and we will deliver a product. We are fortunate, as we have said before, particularly in Columbus, we have been expanding our automotive presence. A lot of our automotive customer base is actually European, so BMW, VW and Mercedes. They have tended not to be as hard hit in Q2 as some of the domestic producers and we certainly benefited from that. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. I think I would just complement to what Mark said in that, where we saw the most market share gains was in the flat roll group, as well as structural steels, railroad rail. And then we have a bit of a niche in the solar products with the solar customers as well both within the hot rolled side of the business and within the specialty steel, the Steel of West Virginia. And in addition to that, with the advent of the Columbus teams starting up with the third galvanizing line, it will be nice to see that getting into the market and actually increasing the value add portion of their capabilities in the second half of this year. So I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for us to both enrich the mix and then to continue in that market share gain. Mark Millett : And just to emphasize that\u2026 Chris Terry : Okay. Mark Millett : Just like anecdotally because we continue to say that part of our strength as a company through-cycle, generating strong through-cycle cash is the diversity of our product mix. And just as an example, Steal of West Virginia, small metal for us, but they were impacted pretty dramatically by the reduction in truck and trailer. That industry is off about 50%. But because of their expansion into solar, they are going to ship about 100,000 tons of solar product, as compared to 30,000 tons last year. And so it\u2019s the diversification both the product and market sector allows us to outperform our competition quarter in, quarter out. Chris Terry : Thanks. Thanks for the comment. And just a follow-up question on some of your comments around construction specifically, obviously, this is a market where it\u2019s pretty hotly debated where it\u2019s all trending with different indicators, suggesting a slowdown and some concern in that market. Can -- you commented, I think, that there\u2019s been no broad brush cancellation, but some changes in the market on an individual level. Has there been a change in your backlog, your total backlog in that market? Mark Millett : Well, on a -- from a loan product standpoint, Structural and Rail Division, their backlog is actually up quarter-over-quarter. We see continued strength there that the fabricators are remaining very busy. The large projects remained strong and constructively some of the smaller product -- projects that were kind of delayed or put on hold earlier in the year because of COVID, we are starting to see those projects now getting released. So we are very, very constructive, obviously, we get insight or visibility through our New Millennium Building Systems, our Fabrication business. There, again, very, very strong backlog. No widespread push backs or project postponements. A little softness up in the Northeast, that\u2019s not a big market for us, but some of the construction sites were closed down and have been closed down, but seriously, we see very, very positive strength through the rest of the year. Chris Terry : Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dave Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question. Dave Gagliano : Great. Thanks for asking my questions. I -- first of all, I just have one quick clarification question and I did look at the EBITDA reconciliation tables before asking this. But does the second quarter adjusted EBITDA, the $217 million number, does that include or exclude those $10 million of costs tied to the startup at Sinton and also does that include or exclude some or all of the $25 million at one-time refinancing costs called out in the adjusted EPS? Theresa Wagler : Yeah. So, Dave, whatever is in the EBITDA on adjusted basis is -- are non-cash items only. So at Sinton, those are cash items, so there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s been excluded. So they are deducted from the adjusted EBITDA, and from a financing perspective only, I think, about $4 million were actually added back, because they were non-cash write-offs. Otherwise, if it\u2019s cash related, we are not adding that back. Dave Gagliano : Okay. Great. So it\u2019s consistent. I just want to make sure consistent with the adjusted EPS. Thanks. And then just on the market, you mentioned, obviously, quite a bit of idled sheet capacity. It sounds like at least 5 million of that is coming back very soon or in the process of coming back annual capacity and arguably, perhaps, closer to 7 million to 8 million tons if those reduced utilization rates ramp up. And it seems to be happening when the time -- at a time when lead times are actually still pretty low for the industry overall and then you also flagged obviously prime scrap supplies are coming back as well. So my questions are, do you believe that the demand environment is strong enough to absorb these near-term restarts, and likewise, do you believe that scrap demand will be strong enough to absorb the incremental prime scrap supplies or do you see weakness beyond August for prime scrap prices as well? Mark Millett : Well, taking your last question on -- from a scrap perspective, we certainly see no issues with the scrap flow. Obviously, there was a month that got a little tight when you had all the automotive or -- virtually all the automotive production and their associated support facilities and the staff was down, prime scrap absolutely ground to a halt. But we are seeing that come back quite dramatically and that\u2019s going to continue to come back. And I think that the scrap market was -- has been over baked for the last few months and that the recent downtick kind of normalized at some. I think you will see a little more -- a bit more softness in August on scrap, I mean, on prime scrap in particular and then stabilize at a more normalized value for the rest of the year. So -- but supply should not be an issue whatsoever. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. Dave, I have -- Mark and I are looking into a little bit, because from a capacity standpoint, I guess, maybe you heard things that we haven\u2019t. We are not -- you seemed to suggest that there\u2019s somewhere between 5 million and 7 million tons of capacity coming back online in the near-term and then that\u2019s not a number that we would ascribe to. Dave Gagliano : What numbers you ascribe -- subscribe to us as far as the capacity of coming back. We just added up the ones that we have heard about in various trade publications\u2026 Theresa Wagler : We are more\u2026 Dave Gagliano : \u2026 that kind of thing? Theresa Wagler : Yeah. We actually -- there\u2019s some capacity that we believe is coming offline and I am not sure if that\u2019s been made public or not. But we would say that is likely to be in the 1.5 million to 2 million tons of capacity that we see coming back on line in the near-term. So, from that perspective, I guess, our answer will be that, yes, we believe that that can be satisfied if you will. I mean we are not seeing a big reaction to that. But, again, I -- maybe we are behind on the announcement. Mark Millett : And obviously it is\u2026 Dave Gagliano : No. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Mark Millett : Obviously, David, it\u2019s a balance between what may come back, and obviously, the increase in demand. There\u2019s absolutely no doubt demand is increasing, obviously, as automotive ramps back up. They are -- there\u2019s some little dislocations here or there in the supply chain, but the demand is picking up, I think, relatively substantially. And if you look at least the conversations I have had out there with some of the large dealerships and if you look at the cars, automotive information and that sort of thing, there is a tightness in inventory, in the dealerships, particularly on pickup, SUV, crossover type vehicles and that\u2019s going to help support at least the output of the automotives. So the automotives I do believe are going to be in good shape, constrained only by, perhaps, regional issues from COVID and making sure they have the employees in their plants. What we are also seeing on the sheet product side of things, the white goods, HVAC appliance, they are coming back very, very strong as well from a potential output sort of demand perspective. In fact, we had one HVAC customer just call us this week making damn sure that we had the material in the pipeline, because they are running at an excessive or above normal volume, and again, only constrained by possible local issues with the sort of manning their plant. So underlying demand we see, and again, those that know don\u2019t predict and those that don\u2019t know predict. All we can go on is what we see in our order book, our order input rate and the commentary from our customers. We see a very healthy underlying economy there, steel consuming economy. We came into this incredibly strong in the first quarter and I think now you have got a little bit of a pent-up demand. Lean -- you have got inventories that are generally lean, particularly in the distributor space as they don\u2019t want to take any speculative risk right now. Imports are going to be constrained for the rest of the year. You have iron ore pricing, raw material pricing actually for the integrated mills is very, very strong, which is going to support the global cost curve. So you have got general dynamics within or general drivers within our industry that I would suggest bode well for the rest of the year. Dave Gagliano : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for the additional color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. You may proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions today. If I can, I have a couple of questions with regards to the outlook for the Fabrication business, please and the margin there. Can you just comment on how you viewed sustainability at least in healthy fab margins as you look ahead to the second half? In light of the current steel price weakness, is there potential for some upside going into Q3 or do you view the recent run rate being more sustainable in the longer term, I recognize we are already below where we were back in 2019? And then secondly with regards to fab, I wonder if you can comment a little bit with regards to some of the end markets you are serving there with regard potentially any shift between, say, public or private sector activity for fab? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. Seth, so from the perspective of the fabrication -- the business margin, so as Mark mentioned, the teams are forecasting a pretty strong volume for the second half of this year based on the order backlog that they have and the order inquiry rates that we are seeing, which is great. You asked about specific end markets and they are very much into the, we are going to call the big box buildings, the warehouses. We have a large market share in that. So if you can think about the advent of online ordering, people not going to retail locations, that business right now is fairly strong, because there is needed warehouse space. As far as whether or not we are seeing it more in the public versus private sector, I think, we are seeing it right now still more to the private than to the public sector, but maybe that could change depending upon what stimulus looks like, I don\u2019t think anybody knows what that is at this point in time. Regarding margins, they tend to have anywhere between maybe around even six weeks to eight weeks or more weeks of steel inventory on the ground. So as we work through the lower priced steel environment they will benefit from that. So you could see some margin expansion in the second half of the year related to that. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a little bit difficult to predict, but I would suggest, that the margins that they have been able to sustain are not extraordinary from the level of being able to be sustainable into the future. Seth Rosenfeld : Very clear. Thank you very much. Theresa Wagler : And I am not sure if I hit all your points or not. Okay. Great. Thanks. Seth Rosenfeld : That\u2019s great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. You may proceed with your question. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you. Just one question from me and just following up on when you are talking about the scrap price coming down obviously and where you on spread. This is typically an environment where we have historically seen you capture market share and you are obviously doing that at the moment. So, I guess, just trying to get a little bit of a stent. How comfortable do you feel about the current spreads as they are at the moment, I mean, we have obviously seen steel prices coming down and scraps coming down as well, and the falling steel price, obviously, effectively prevent some of the integrators on restarting capacity. So do you feel comfortable with spreads at the current level, I guess, the question? Mark Millett : Again, it\u2019s interesting times to predict and when you said in an environment you used the word typical. I don\u2019t think there is anything typical about the environment that we are in. All I can say is, I do believe we have reached a trough point. Second quarter was the trough for volumes for sure, particularly on the sheet side of our business, and I think, there is an inflection point in pricing in the next few weeks. So I think that that\u2019s a positive direction or a momentum for pricing, and as I suggested, you are likely to see a little softness on prime scrap here in August and then kind of stable for the rest of the year. So you can make your own predictions as to where spreads might go. I need to emphasize that some of you recognize this, but you have got to recognize that some of our business, our flat-rolled business is related to sort of the CRU index-type pricing and so there is a lag impact in the third quarter. Theresa Wagler : I am smiling, Andreas, because I don\u2019t know if we are comfortable with spreads. We always like as high a spread as we possibly can have. But to Mark\u2019s point, I think, on a spot basis there is an opportunity to see spreads expand. Is it fair, Mark? Mark Millett : Yeah. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That\u2019s clear. Thank you very much for taking my question. Mark Millett : You are welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. You may proceed with your question. John Tumazos : Congratulations on all of the good work in a tough time. Your steel\u2026 Mark Millett : Thank you, John. Yeah. We have got a great team. John Tumazos : Your steel scrap collections fell 2 times or 3 times more than the steel shipments. Were you deliberately reducing mill inventories of scrap or inventories in the recycling system or did the opportunities to collect scrap decline with the economy or did outside brokers gain share and if a business doesn\u2019t earn good returns, maybe it\u2019s okay thing if you let the other guys do more business at a loss? Mark Millett : Well, I think, a little bit of all of the above. Obviously, scrap flow dropped dramatically because of automotive business. Prime scrap pretty well dried up, so that impacted flows. Flows from OmniSource to our mills was strong, it went up. But at the same time, our competition had their own problems. They weren\u2019t producing as much and so we had less homes to broker scrap to. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. Mark Millett : You are welcome. Operator : This concludes your question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Laura. And for those that remain on the call, again, thank you for your attention today, joining us. I just would like to emphasize what an absolutely phenomenal performance our team demonstrated this past quarter. They say when conditions get tough, the tough get going, that\u2019s our team. They did a tremendous, tremendous job and I think it clearly demonstrates the passion, the commitment and the innovation of our team, but also the strength of our business model, because, again, we generated a very, very, very strong cash flow for the quarter under the circumstances. And we would also like to thank our customer base because you folks on the call, you certainly unload us, you certainly supported our ability to perform our peers. So thank you for that. And to all the employees on the call, thank you, thank you, thank you, you did a great job, be safe. Make it a great day. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. We appreciate your time and thanks for joining us today. We continue to operate safely and are still closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation. Protecting the health and welfare of our teams is our highest priority. I thank each of them for their continued diligence and commitment. I'm incredibly proud to work alongside each of them, especially during this unsettled time. They are a very special group, accomplishing extraordinary things. We are committed to them, their families and our communities, all while supporting our suppliers and meeting the needs of our customers. So without further ado, I will hand the mike to Teresa to provide further insights into our strong third quarter performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter 2020 net income was $100 million or $0.47 per diluted share above our guidance of $0.42 to $0.46 per share due to stronger than anticipated flat rolled steel shipments and metals recycling earnings. Our third quarter results were reduced by cost net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill of approximately $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these construction costs, third quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.51 per diluted share, also above our adjusted guidance of $0.46 to $0.50 per share. One comment before proceeding, the compatibility of third quarter 2020 financial results to prior year amounts isn't favorable. But to achieve what our teams have achieved in this environment is simply incredible. And I want to add to Mark's comments and sincerely thank and congratulate them. Our third quarter 2020 revenues were $2.3 billion, 11% higher than second quarter sequential results, as volumes improved across all three operating platforms. Our third quarter 2020 operating income was $156 million, fairly steady with the sequential second quarter, but 32% lower than prior year results due to lower steel prices resulting in metal spread compression. However, currently, we've experienced a very strong rebound in domestic steel demand from the second quarter sequential COVID-19 induced trough environment. Customers steel inventory levels were extremely low entering the second quarter, and then were drawn down even further based on market uncertainty. From an operating platform perspective, our steel operations delivered an outstanding performance during this challenging time. Third quarter steel shipments of 2.7 million ton were 7% higher than the sequential second quarter shipments, and on par with prior year's third quarter volume. Our steel mills operated at 85% of their capability, while the rest of the domestic industry operated at only 64%. Due to the momentum from our record first quarter volume, our year-to-date steel shipments are only 1% lower than in 2019. Our ability to maintain higher steel volumes is a result of our value added highly diversified product offerings, our supply chain differentiation and our internal downstream manufacturing businesses. However, based on timing and the impact of flat roll contract related sales, our average quarterly realized steel price per ton declined sequentially, more than offsetting the benefit of lower scrap costs and higher volumes. Our average quarterly realized external steel sales price decreased $21 per ton sequentially to $734 in the third quarter, an average scrap costs only declined $7 per ton, resulting in steel metal margin compression. The result was third quarter 2020 operating income of $144 million for our steel operation, 17% lower than the sequential second quarter.  As states began reopening and domestic manufacturing improved, scrap supply and collection increased. This in combination with higher domestic steel production drove significantly higher ferrous scrap volume. Our operating income from our mills recycling operations was $15 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a $6 million loss in the sequential second quarter. We also are benefiting from the addition of Zimmer, our newly acquired Mexican metals recycling business. The acquisition was completed in August. It's a key cog in our ongoing raw material strategy for our new Texas Steel Mill. Our Metals Recycling Operations provide a competitive advantage for sourcing ferrous scrap or steel mills allowing for increased scrap quality; melt efficiency and reduction of company wide working capital. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Our Steel Fabrication business had a record operating income of $39 million in the third quarter, compared to sequential results of $27 million due to record shipments and margin expansion as product pricing increased while steel input costs declined. We continue to experience a strong order backlog and customers remain positive concerning our non residential construction projects. In fact, the Steel and Joist Institute recorded one of its strongest historical booking months this last September. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2020, we generated $152 million of cash flow from operations and $849 million during the first nine months of the year. We also invested $855 million in fixed assets, of which $640 million was invested in our new Texas Flat Rolls Steel Mill. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe capital investments will be roughly $400 million, of which our new Texas Steel Mill represents $360 million. We currently estimate capital investments for the full year of 2021 to be in the range of $850 million, with the Texas Steel Mill representing about $700 million of that amount as their operations are still expected to begin mid year 2021. In addition, I've been getting a lot of questions about our effective tax rate. For 2020, the effective cash tax rate will be approximately 20% for the year. However, based on credits we expect to receive due to the certain Sinton Texas Mill, we would expect 2020 cash taxes to only be approximately 3%. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.25 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of this year. Since 2016, we've also invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares, and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the third quarter.  Additionally, we opportunistically access the investment grade capital markets in both June and October of this year, extending our debt maturity profile and significantly reducing our effective interest rate. We're thrilled with the differentiation our investment grade bond investors recognize that Steel Dynamics provides in our fundamental free cash flow generation capability on a through cycle basis. As evident in October, we issued $350 million of 1.65%, seven year paper, and $400 million as 3.25% 30 year paper with proceeds intended to refinance our existing 2025 notes, and other general corporate purposes. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile, demonstrating our confidence and our sustainable through cash strong generation. We enter 2020 in a position of strength with ample cash and available liquidity of $2.8 billion. And at the end of the third quarter, we maintain strong liquidity of $2.5 billion comprised of cash of $1.3 billion and our fully available revolving unsecured credit facility of $1.2 billion. Pro forma our October financing activities, our liquidity would have been $2.8 billion. As a reminder, you're seeing this is our performance in the current market environment. And you can look historically at our financial performance to determine either a future trough or peak, we've grown significantly transformed our Columbus Flat Roll division, further diversified our steel product offerings and incorporated even more levers to increase our through cycles financial performance.  In addition, collectively, our primary reason and plan strategic growth investments provide an estimated incremental annual future EBITDA of over $425 million on a through cycle historical spread basis. This estimate includes our Texas Steel Mill and third Columbus Metallic Coating line, as well as our two operational rebar expansions. We are simply even more agile today than ever before. We more than doubled our annual free cash flow from operations to $1.1 billion from 2015 to 2019, compared to 2010 to 2014. We are dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating, our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with appropriate shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of the sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Some of you also use some more detailed information for flat roll operations. I'll give you the third quarter shipment profile now; our hot roll coiled shipments for the third quarter were 803,000 tons. Our cold rolled shipments were 144,000 tons. And our coated shipments were 1,013,000 tons for a total of 1,960,000 tons. And on a personal note, I really do want to thank our teams for their passion and their generosity, and really the care they're showing for each other's health and safety. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Teresa. Thank you for clearly articulating the differentiation of SDI amongst its competition, I think we've just navigated just navigated to an incredible cycle, then turn and then recovery and the performance that our team is turned in is just the beyond words, it's humbling. And speaking of them, in the end, nothing really is more important than the safety of our team. Safety is and always will be our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our continued goal is to have no injuries among our people. Our safety performance is further improved from a severity perspective. However, among some of the operating platforms, our third quarter safety results were not what we would like to see for our teams. We all must be continuous aware of our surroundings, and our fellow team members, I asked all of us to keep safety top of mind to control safety, we can take charge of safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health.  Steel Fabrication platform delivered a remarkable third quarter performance with record quarterly volume and earnings. Our fabrication order backlog remains strong is higher than it was this time last year, and in fact higher than 2018. Customers remain positive concerning non residential construction projects. We anticipate the strength remaining through the rest of this year and into 2021. The metals recycling volumes and earnings also meaningfully improved in the third quarter. As states rescinded shelter in place mandates, and the automotive supply chain restarted, scrap flows dramatically improved through the third quarter. The same time domestic steel production utilization increased from an average 56% to an estimated 64% and first scraps demand significantly improved. As flows continue to increase and steel production remains steady. We believe scrap prices should remain fairly stable through the remainder of the year, with likely seasonal price appreciation in December, January timeframe. We also welcome the Zimmer team into the Steel Dynamics family. The addition of this Mexican metals recycling business is a meaningful step in our raw material sourcing strategy for our Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. The combination of Zimmer with our existing operations has already resulted in new business, and we're excited for the continued growth. The steel team continues to achieve an outstanding performance, especially considering the environment and a sincere thank you to all involved, especially our customers for helping us achieve volumes that only modestly less than record shipments achieved in the first quarter of this year. As a result of COVID-19 related implications, a considerable number of high cost blast furnaces flat roll steel operations were idled earlier this year, potentially as much as 15 million tons. Since that timeframe, as steel demand and pricing has improved, an estimated 5 to 6 million tons has been brought back online. Although some additional volume may return, we don't believe all of it will come back. The cost of restart along with through cycle market pricing not supporting ongoing profitability will likely keep significant volume curtailed, offsetting the new capacity increases to be seen over the next 24 months.  While the overall domestic industry operated only 64%; the strength of our differentiated business model, coupled with the passion of our people drove SDI steel mill production utilization to 85%. Even more remarkable, our flat roll steel mills achieve utilization 99%. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our superior business model become even more evident. As demonstrated this year, during periods of market inflection we maintain higher volumes compared to our steel peers and gain market share. And uninterrupted low cost operations provide the greatest customer optionality. Our broad product portfolio and end market diversification within value added market niches drives flexibility for our commercial teams.  Superior Supply Chain Solutions create additional value for our customers, making us a preferred place to shop. Furthermore, a powerful driver is the optionality of internal steel sourcing from our captive manufacturing businesses, what we call pull through volume. To put this in perspective, our steel fabrication platform and steel processing locations purchased 2.3 million tons of steel in 2019. Only about half of this volume is typically sourced from SDI own steel mills, but in difficult markets, where the option to direct the higher proportion of these orders internally. As states continue to reopen to varying degrees, many steel consuming businesses have resumed operations. At the same time, customer inventory levels have been reduced to extremely low levels. This combination of increasing demand coupled with low inventory reserves has resulted in a tight flat roll steel supply environment. As a result, lead times stretched out and flat roll steel pricing has significantly improved. The hot rolled coil CIU Price Index increased almost $160 per ton from the beginning of August to September, and has since increased another $40 to $50 per ton. The automotive supply chain has experienced the most significant recovery, attending production levels of either close to or in some cases more than pre-COVID levels of concern. Our construction sector remains resilient and related steel demand has been steady as evidenced by our structural rail division volume, and our record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlog. The order activity from our construction sector customers combined with strength in our steel fabrication order backlog support our optimism for continued strength through the rest of this year, heading into 2021. Residential Construction has also been surprisingly strong, generating high demand for HVAC and appliance products. The energy sector though continues to be structurally weak and will likely require long than recovery period. Related to our growth, we have a summary update of recent investments in our most recently investor deck. In the last 12 to 24 months, we've executed several strategic investments that have already or will meaningfully benefit our through cycle earnings and free cash flow position. We expanded two steel mills by the combined addition of 440,000 tons of annual steel rebar production capability, providing product diversification and a differentiated customer supply chain. This end market diversification is providing for hire through cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke steel divisions. We continue to expand capacity at Harlan. It is an 800,000 ton value added flat roll steel processor. The team has been operating at record levels, providing additional internal production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll division, increasing the utilization of our steel assets and broadening our value added product portfolio. The acquisition of 75% of United Steel Supply has also been an excellent investment in addition to our portfolio. As a local distributor of pre painted construction products, it has provided meaningful channels and new more diversified customers. United Steel Supply continues to break shipping records. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll division in 2014, we have meaningfully increased it through cycling and its capability. We've transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of its value added steel capabilities and the diversification of its customer base. The team achieved another milestone in July with a startup of a new 400,000 ton of value add coating line. Columbus now has four higher margin coating lines there. The investment both reduces Columbus' hot roll coil exposure and provides a ready Southern hot band consumer base for our Sinton Texas Steel Mill. We remain incredibly excited about the new generation of flat rolled steel mill, is significant contribution to our growth and future earnings capability. As Theresa explained, we purposefully ended 2020 from a point of financial strength, providing ample liquidity for the required investment associated with this transformational project. Our team has incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we believe they have more experience than exists in any other company in our industry. The Texas' team's performance and momentum continues to be absolutely remarkable. Construction is going extremely well. We're still on track for a mid year 2021 start date. We're having frequent conversations with equipment suppliers regarding the impact of COVID-19 and currently don't believe our planned schedule has been meaningfully impacted. The new state of the art 3 million tons steel mill will include two value added coating lines, comprised of 550,000 tons of galvanizing and 250,000 tons of prepaint. We'll follow the same stringent sustainability model as either steel making facilities with state of the art environmental controls and processes. Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steel making technology. With an 84-inch coil width and up to one inch thick, 100 KSI products; the Texas mill will have capabilities beyond the existing electric arc furnace produces competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and foreign competition. The Steel Mill is strategically located in Central Texas, near Corpus Christi. We have three target regional sales markets for the Sinton Mill, representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption. In the Southern and West Coast, United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with heavy imports in Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We now have three customers committed to locate on site representing between 800,000 and a million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity; we're still speaking with several other interested parties. The Sinton location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended customers relative to the current supply chain options. This trade advantage coupled with much shorter lead times; provides a superior customer supply chain, allowing us to be the preferred domestic steel supplier in the South and Western US. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material strategy for Sinton. As I mentioned, we completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company in August. This is a critical step in our strategy; the acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the US and Mexico, and Zimmer's operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. Prior to our ownership, they shipped approximately 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but they have an estimated annual processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons a year, we plan to ramp up that volume quickly. We believe our performance based operating culture, coupled with our consumer experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel mills positions is incredibly well to successfully execute the transformational Texas growth investment. We're not simply adding the flat roll production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer an important import alternative to a region in need of options. Our unique culture and the execution of a long-term strategy continue to strengthen our financial position through consistent, strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Clearly differentiates us from our competition and demonstrating our sustainability.  This is clearly been demonstrated during the past two quarters. Again, our commitment is to the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors serving our customers, and sustaining our value creation journey. Our team is extraordinary. And I would like to thank each of them for their patience, resilience and commitment during these uncharted times. They have an indomitable spirit that drives us to excellent. Additionally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the healthcare providers and their families within steel Nanites and those serving individuals across the world.  Thank you, be safe, and be well. So Shomali, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. SethRosenfeld: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions today. If I can kick off please just with a question on kind of the near to medium term outlook for demand. In your prepared remarks you presented quite an optimistic outlook on steel demand highlighting both autos and construction. Can you just speak with regards to the outlook for Q4? How should we expect the trade off between the kinds of post COVID real demand recovery to potentially offset by normal seasonality that we've seen in the years past? What should we expect per shipments in your mills and fab businesses over that time period? And then just a follow up on that with regards to construction in particular, your comments with regards to the backlog in particular can be much more positive, we heard last week from one of your peers. Can you speak a bit about the regions or maybe the private versus public sector mix that's contributing to the optimism? Thank you. MarkMillett: Certainly, I would carry my comments that, as I've said in the past, you can, I think always clearly see what's happening in the marketplace through one's order book. And I think our order books across our space are in pretty good shape. But generally, obviously, fat roll demand is going to cutting probably strong momentum. There's a robust market recovery there, inventories are at almost a starkly low levels. We have low import activity, there's a -- although is diminishing, the arbitrage is still somewhat unattractive. So the supply side is very, very tight; lead times, as you see are extending; mills are -- some mills anyway have late deliveries. And all-in-all, that's driving market pricing up significantly, quite helpfully.  That being said, obviously, our third quarter results were impacted by sort of contract pricing lag. And that will revert obviously in Q4, but just specifically to the market times up in automotive, the US producers have I think achieved their anticipated 90% run rate, pre-COVID run rates. And I would say that the European producers actually are exceeding that. They're more than 100% of pre-COVID for sure. And that's being supported, obviously by low inventory levels in the dealerships. Dealerships that I talked to are struggling to get product. And I think if you look at just the automotive market in general, it's supports that; used car prices are extremely high today. And interestingly, that's somehow an impact on the scrap market. Because hoaxer, the pickup guys are keeping their cars longer. And it's given a little tightness to the scrap supply. But nonetheless, it's a good market environment. And we believe that's going to continue. The low interest rate environment is obviously a positive as our low gas prices. I saw just yesterday, our gas prices dropped to $1 95. And so that tends to help certainly the truck sales. And I think generally, that's going to continue, the sort of urban desertion of people moving out of the cities. Rideshare sharing and Uber and most not necessarily as available. And people are needing cars. And I think automotives will remain strong. It's not just a sort of a two month three month replenishment of inventory. In that environment, we've been fortunate, we've been gaining market share. And I think both in flat roll and in MSPQ, just generally manufacturing is strong. We see residential construction, incredibly strong. And I think that's having an impact both the new construction and HVAC and appliance and garage door products, but also kind of the do-it-yourself renovation projects. There's been a change, I think, in consumer spending, people are not going out as much; they see themselves not going on vacations. And so they are actually I think spending that cash closer to home. And I think that's a positive going to next year for sure. Energy, low gas prices, low energy prices; global demand is there. So I think that's going to be weak for some time to come. A very, very strong positive is non residential construction. It's been in all honesty, incredibly resilient.  We see that in sort of heavy structural products demand fabricators are busy. Service center processes are buying stock off of our floor. And so I think there's generally low inventory through the supply chain there. And if you look at the Steel Joist Institute information, I think is incredibly persuasive. In September, Steel Joist Institute bookings were its third highest month in history; bookings are about 10% year-over-year. And it's largely driven by warehouse expansion and you keep seeing the e- commerce increasing; e-commerce in the first quarter at 11%, last quarter is about 16%. So the Amazons of the world are the distribution channel is going to remain strong. I think just yesterday, on Bloomberg, you saw Amazon reporting that they're going to be constructing about a 1,000 warehouses in the next year or two. So that business is going to be incredibly, incredibly positive, going forward. And that's translating into sort of a record backlog for new millennium, and is obviously [Indiscernible] into strong building products on the flat roll side of our business. It's HVAC pre paint is very, very strong. So I think, generally, it's a very, very positive environment, and we're very bullish. Again, you can tell what may happen as the pandemic continue to unravel. But through our eyes, through our order book today, is an incredibly solid, positive upward momentum. TheresaWagler: So, Seth, your other questions related to the mix between private and public sector on the construction side, I would tell you that it's very heavily weighted at this point to private sector. Hopefully, if maybe some things happen in Washington, it could get more into the public sector eventually. But we're not seeing that at this point to Mark's earlier comments. And from a seasonality perspective as it relates to volumes. And we did come off record volumes for the fabrication, I'm not sure that will stay as strong, but we'd expect to see very strong shipments heading into the fourth quarter. And the split on the steel side, you really I think need to look at a split between long products and flat products. It's our estimation that given the strong demand that is existing today for the flat rolled products, I doubt you're going to see a lot of seasonality, or at least much less than you would see typically. And the long product, you're likely to see some but again, I think coming off of the very weak second quarter, we would expect to see some momentum carry into the fourth quarter environment and meet that seasonality impact. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. ChristopherTerry: Hi, Mark and Theresa. And a quick question for me, your utilization rate is about 20% above the industry, I think you said you had market share gains in autos, just wanted if you could elaborate on other product basis or end markets where you're getting those market gains from. Thanks. MarkMillett: I think from automotive perspective, we are, the fact that we remain running, gave customer base optionality and just the availability of product for one thing, but secondly, the whole ESG sustainability story, I think is planning incredibly well for us and for electric arc furnace produces, particularly with the Europeans in all honesty and as they see their North American options. The fact that we have a wonderful sort of recycling ESG story is helping us now. So I think in the market share automotive is strong, also SPQ in auto, obviously, we constructed and ramped up the smaller diameter mill there some years ago. We're seeing some positive market share gains there as well. TheresaWagler: And, I guess, the other component I would add is that with the advent of having reinforcing bar as a product set as we enter the market, we've been seeing some positive momentum from that as well. Operator : Our next question is from Timna Tanners from with Bank of America. TimnaTanners: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to dive in a little bit more if you could on the recycling and fabricated. I think my question that was maybe answered a bit but just those were really strong rebounds sequentially and even strong from a trend basis. So I was hoping that you could tell us how sustainable those might be and fab may have had a bit margin expansion on the low steel price maybe that reverses, but just in general terms like is that a good new run rate or what to think about going forward in those areas? TheresaWagler: Well, certainly for scrapped, Timna, we would see that going forward. Obviously in that business, it's kind of an inventory flow. You buy one month and you sell the next month. So when you have a stable pricing environment, one tends to do a lot better, as opposed to the periods where you just see progressive downward pricing trends month over month, and obviously volume played a big role in recycling. TheresaWagler: Yes, from a recycling perspective, I'd say that remember we did close on the Mexican scrap company in the first part of August, which was actually very beneficial; we find that the Mexican market is a little bit different than domestic market. So it might be a natural hedge going forward as well. In addition to that, to Mark's point, if domestic steel productions phase very strong, which we expected to stay strong in the fourth quarter, you're going to see that volume come to metal recycling arena. So we would expect it to be very steady as not improving. And I think for the fabrication, you really kind of hit it a bit too in that with the low raw material input costs it had, it really did benefit from where the steel mills sort of suffered in the second quarter. So you will see that sustainable for a little while. But as steel prices continue to increase, it's not likely that you're going to get dollar for dollar margin expansion in fabrication, but we do expect to see still very strong volumes and good results. TimnaTanners: Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then my second question was if you could just discuss a little bit more the outlook for CapEx as a couple things I wanted to follow up on. So one is that you talk about a little higher number than possibly the $850 million compares to $700 million, $750 million in last quarters. So is that just kind of a drag from this year maybe a little lighter spending next year catching up? And how do we think about further capital allocation beyond if you could start to give us some thoughts on what you're looking at that? TheresaWagler: Well, from the CapEx perspective, it's not more capital, Timna, but to your comment, it's actually a transfer. So we're expecting to probably spend about $100 million less in 2020. As it relates to Sinton Mill, it's just hard to project, it's when equipment arrives, et cetera, nothing is delaying the project, it's just we believe that probably about $100 million will shift from the fourth quarter into 2021. So that's why 2021 total capital estimate today is $850 million versus a $750 million. It's simply related to timing. Mark, did you want to talk about the capital allocation or -? MarkMillett: Well, I think Timna, our strategy is not going to change; we've always been somewhat conservative relative to the balance sheet and liquidity. We still remain very comfortable with our dividend profile, it's very manageable through cycle and it will remain intact. And during periods of excess cash flow we will continue to share repurchase program to complement that dividend policy. But right now, we see immediate strength and momentum in the markets. And I think things are good. But we'd like to see how things unravel for next three, four months, before we reinitiate any repurchase program. TheresaWagler: And I would just add to that as a quick reminder that our sustaining capital is only $150 million per year. So as we get on the other side of the Texas Steel Mill, there'll be considerable cash generation, which we can use to Mark's point for continued growth, both organic and inorganic. Operator : Our next question is from Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. AndreasBokkenheuser: Thank you very much. Just a follow up question for you. I mean, you obviously mentioned the Texas Mill and you've talked about it before and in terms of where you intend to kind of capture market share. But in particularly now with a lot of integrated capacity down and for your point, Mark, you guys don't expect all of it to come back. Are there any particular products where you see the new Texas Mill base capturing market share namely on the auto side, products that you weren't able to produce before, but you will be able to produce with the new mills, will you effectively could just continue that market share capturing trend as well? MarkMillett: I think we can gone on market share on several different fronts obviously just pure economics, the geographic location of that facility, and freight savings to the customer will be very, very persuasive. Number one, number two, we will be able to be very strong option for imports that floats through Houston. So just general economics or pricing or value to the customer will be massive. And, again, as we see a 27 million ton market between Southwest, the West Coast import market and, and Mexico. But also the technology is going to allow us to produce combinations of grade, strength and dimensional characteristics that are totally unavailable today in the US. It's an 84-inch mill, although a -- let me rephrase that, it's going to make a real 84 -inch wide coil, the current 84-inch mills in the US are just the width of the row itself, and so cannot make 84-inch true width, and you need 84-inch width to get into 26 inch diameter pipe.  And so that is a very differentiating commodity, particularly when you can go to one inch thick, 100 KSI steel. The technology, as we've said in past calls, it's a thicker slab. So it's going to allow a much, much superior surface condition. And if there was a technology or minimal technology to get into, exposed automotive, this would be it. We're not advertising that, but certainly would hope we get that one day. But higher toughness, highest strength steel will certainly differentiate the product portfolio compared to what's available in the States today. TheresaWagler: And I think from an end market perspective, what you'll see is that this will take market share along the lines, especially because we're starting with a paint line and a galvanizing metal coating line will be in the appliance arena, especially in Mexico, automotive in Mexico, HVAC, metal buildings will be a big focus point as well, then obviously, when the energy market comes back, we'll be right in the middle of that arena. AndreasBokkenheuser: That's very clear. And in terms of sourcing of raw materials, I mean, you're obviously you've got pig iron coming in, and you have scrap from Mexico and so on. Any thoughts on HPI? I mean, we're obviously seeing some HPI capacity coming online in the US. Some of it might all be spoken for. But any thoughts on HPI that's going to be part of your product makes it a great deal going forward? MarkMillett: Well, we would contemplate all raw materials in honestly, I think you have obviously Nucor has been ramping up and is doing well now there. You have Cliffs will be starting their facility that likely would be ineffective from a freight perspective to go all the way down into Sinton. But certainly will find its way into the Midwest market. And just by association, they help the raw material pricing environment. Voest has a DRI or HBI facility in Corpus Christi. And I would imagine the Sinton mill would be a natural home for someone that material and so again, if the value is right, we would be consuming some of that material. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Olin with Tier4. ChrisOlin: Yes, sorry about that. Hey, I wanted to first see if I can get a clarification. Theresa, did you say the cash tax was 3% for 2021? And then I guess I had a mini follow up question regarding this whole market share issue. I guess my question is there were some outages, I guess unplanned if you will, at some of the steel assets or coating lines for your competitors and I guess I wanted to make sure there wasn't some type of volume or mixed benefit in the Quarter that potentially goes away or we need to think about going forward. Thanks. TheresaWagler: I'll answer the first question, Chris. And yes, our cash, our effective cash tax rate for 2021 is likely to only be around 3%. And that's just reflective of state taxes. Because at least currently with the tax code, with Sinton actually starting in 2021, we're able to, from a tax perspective, take the immediate depreciation impact for that. And it's quite significant. So we would expect that to take care of all the cash requirements from a federal basis for 2021. And likely that would roll into having some protection into 2022 as well; we just don't have that estimate at this point. MarkMillett: Yes and regarding the ban, yes. There's some shifting of products here and there between the different players. But the market strength, and our results are; it's just the underlying demand profile there, which is going to remain in place for some time to come. That concludes our question-and-answer session; I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you. And for those remaining on the call seriously, thank you for your support and your time today to listen to our perspectives. To the customers that may be listening, sincere thank you on my behalf. And on behalf of every one of the 9,000 SDI employees and their families; you helped us through a challenging time. And we will hopefully continue to earn your business and to all our team members on the call. Again, one shout out regarding safety, please double down on safety. It wasn't a disastrous quarter in any respect, severity continues to improve. But nonetheless, we need to continue our improving trend there. And just thank you for your passion, your commitment through this challenging quarter. It's been a crazy time. But you folks have come through as always shining like superstars. So thank you, you guys. Be safe. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full Year 2020 earnings call. I apologize for the early hour, particularly for those that may be on the - coming in from the West Coast, but hopefully, you're going to enjoy the results, nonetheless. Because 2020 was a year of unprecedented health and economic challenge as we navigated the impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. Yet through the extraordinary dedication and passion of the Steel Dynamics team, we took care of one another, while also providing for our families and serving our customers. Protecting the health and welfare of our people is our highest priority. And I want to thank each of them for their continued commitment to each other. I am proud to work alongside each of them. They're a special team, and they continue to do incredible things. Despite the challenges, we achieved best-in-class performance, with a record fabrication volume, strong earnings and steel shipments that were only 1% less than our record year, simply a phenomenal performance, given the conditions. We accomplished these milestones while remembering that none of it matters unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. Our safety performance improved in the fourth quarter and notably, our annual 2020 injury severity rate was the lowest in our history. Again, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people. Safety is and always will be our #1 value. Our safety performance is significantly better than industry statistics, but our aim is to have no injuries, and we will work tirelessly to get there. In order to achieve this, we must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keep safety top of mind to control safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health. But before I continue, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to our entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark mentioned, we achieved numerous milestones despite the social and economic impacts from the coronavirus. We achieved revenues of $9.6 billion derived from record fabrication shipments and our second highest annual steel shipments. Operating income of $847 million and net income of $551 million or $2.59 per diluted share, and cash flow from operations of $987 million and adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion, a truly extraordinary performance considering all the peripheral challenges. Regarding our fourth quarter 2020 performance specifically, net income was $188 million or $0.89 per diluted share, which includes financing costs related to our October 2020 refinancing activities of $0.04 per diluted share. Costs net of capitalized interest associated with the construction of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill of $0.05 per diluted share, a noncash asset impairment charge related to noncore oil and gas investments of $17 million or $0.06 per diluted share net of noncontrolling interest; and finally, a tax benefit related to the reduction of a valuation allowance of $13 million or $0.06 per diluted share net of noncontrolling interest. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2020 adjusted net income was $0.97 per diluted share, above our adjusted guidance of $0.80 to $0.84 per share due to stronger-than-anticipated December flat-rolled steel shipments as order activity remains very strong. Our fourth quarter 2020 revenues were $2.6 billion, 12% higher than sequential third quarter results as steel and metals recycling pricing improved. Our fourth quarter 2020 operating income was $259 million, $103 million or 66% higher than sequential third quarter results. Due to higher realized flat-rolled steel pricing more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find that we are positive heading into 2021, considering underlying steel fundamentals and confident in our unique earnings catalyst. All 3 of our operating platforms performed well in 2020 and in the fourth quarter, with the steel metals recycling teams achieving their best quarterly performance of the year. Our steel operations generated $298 million of operating income in the fourth quarter, more than double third quarter sequential earnings as flat-rolled steel selling values increased significantly throughout the fourth quarter driving expanded metal margins. Fourth quarter steel shipments of 2.7 million tons were on par with sequential third quarter volume. Our steel mills operated at 84% of their capability during the quarter, well above the industry average of 72%. For the full year 2020, our steel facilities achieved numerous production and shipment records. The platform's full year operating income was $906 million with shipments of 10.7 million tons, again, representing our second highest volume and only 1% less than our record, a truly phenomenal performance. As a reminder, we still have additional market opportunity. It's mostly in the long product side of our steel operations. Based on our existing annual deal shipping capability of over 13 million tons. And as our new Texas Steel Mill begins ramping up, we will have over 16 million tons of steel shipping capabilities. Our value-added product mix, supply chain differentiation and downstream manufacturing businesses provide a powerful strategic advantage to sustain higher steel mill utilization during all demand environment and to increase our through-cycle cash flow. As overall manufacturing rates improved and domestic steel production increased during 2020, scrap generation and demand strengthened in the fourth quarter, resulting in improved pricing and volume. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $27 million, 75% higher than the sequential third quarter. For the full year 2020, operating income from our metals recycling business was meaningfully higher than prior year, almost 60% higher at $45 million based on higher and more stable fair scrap prices. Our metals recycling operations provide a competitive advantage for sourcing ferrous scrap for our steel mills, allowing for increased scrap quality, melt efficiency and reduction of company-wide working capital requirements. Our vertically connected operating model benefits both platforms. Our steel fabrication business had solid operating income of $25 million in the fourth quarter compared to sequential third quarter record earnings of $39 million. Lower earnings were the result of seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as average selling values declined and steel raw material input cost increase. For the full year 2020, fabrication achieved another record year with operating income of $121 million and volume of 666,000 tons. Congratulations to the team. We continue to see strong order inquiry and customer optimism. Although with rapidly rising steel costs, we will likely see margin compression in the coming months. The order backlog is about a 6-month backlog, and the steel raw material that we put on the ground is generally around 2.5 months of steel inventory. So we're likely to see trough margins sometime in the first quarter for fabrication. But the order entry is very strong right now, and they're actually selling at record high joist-and-deck pricing. So we expect to see that crack very quickly as we go into the second quarter. For our cash flow from operations, our cash generation continues to be incredibly strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we generated $138 million of cash flow from operations and for the full year, $987 million. We are simply even more agile today than ever before, we more than doubled our average annual free cash flow to $1.2 billion from 2016 to 2020. That's compared to the previous 5-year period. Even in midst coronavirus, we generated $980 million of free cash flow this year. Our 2020 capital investments totaled $1.2 billion, of which $928 million was invested in our new Texas flat-rolled steel mill. For 2021, we currently believe capital investments will be roughly $950 million, with the Texas steel mill representing about $800 million of that amount. The Texas steel mill is expected to be within plan of $1.9 billion. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.25 per common share after increasing up 4% in the first quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2020, I should say. Since 2016, we've also increased or invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. We repurchased $107 million in 2020 and $444 million remains authorized for repurchase at the end of the year. Additionally, we opportunistically accessed the investment-grade capital markets in both June and October of 2020, extending our debt maturity profile. Since becoming investment grade, we've significantly reduced our effective interest rate from 5.4% to 3.5%. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow capability and strong liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We entered 2020 in a position of strength. And ample liquidity, and we remain in a position of strength as we enter 2021. At December 31, 2020, liquidity was over $2.5 billion, comprised of cash of $1.4 billion and our unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also being dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit rating. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. We also believe sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. Today, we produce steel using electric-arc-furnace technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material. EAF steel production technology currently has the least environmental impact. It is the most cost-effective and provides the most operational flexibility. With the addition of our mills recycling and fabrication platforms, we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model, created an almost closed-loop manufacturing business, which both benefits us financially and reduces our environmental impact. In 2020, we shared our qualitative climate-related goals in our most recent sustainability report. During 2021, we plan to also adopt quantitative goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participate in greater renewable energy use and continue to invest in energy efficiency opportunities. We are currently in the process of assessing the use of renewable energy alternatives at our new Texas steel mill as well. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. And on a personal note, I want to thank our teams for their passion and generosity and for the care they're showing for one another's health and safety. Thank you. Mark? Mark Millett : Well, thanks, Theresa. As you were talking there, it's a great recap, I think, of our financial performance for sure. But the startling metric there, I think you have a team that produced almost $1 billion in free cash flow during a pandemic in an incredible economic downturn. This speaks remarkably for the team that we have. But as you also mentioned, the steel fabrication platform delivered an outstanding performance, achieving record annual earnings and shipments. The nonresidential construction markets remained resilient throughout 2020, especially in areas that support online retail and computing activities, such as warehouses for the retail distribution and cloud computing functions. This continues to be a strong area for our fabrication projects. We ended the year with a record fabrication customer backlog, which is atypical for this time of year as seasonality tends to impact order activity. So I think it bodes well for the future. As steel prices increase quickly, it's likely we'll see near-term margin compression for the fabrication platform. However, the strong steel pricing environment will obviously benefit our steel operations to a much greater degree. This is one of the strengths of the symbiotic nature of the vertical integration of our primary operating platforms. Another is the ability to keep utilization of our steel mills at the highest level. Our fabrication facilities bought almost 460,000 tons of steel from our own steel mills in 2020, helping mitigate the impact of reduced demand in the second quarter, driving a significantly higher utilization rate as compared to the industry as a whole. Our metals recycling operations performed admirably in the wake of a COVID-19 related state mandates and manufacturing disruptions earlier in the year. The team was critical in supplying our steel mills with adequate scrap when supply was severely reduced during the second quarter. Another example of the strength of our vertical operating platforms. As manufacturing resumed mid-year and domestic steel production increased, scrap generation and demand improved significantly in the second half of 2020, culminating in a significant price increase in January '21 of a $100 per gross ton. We believe scrap generation will be strong in 2021 and that pricing will stabilize at moderately lower levels than we have today. The steel team achieved incredible things this year, and I thank everyone involved because it took a team effort in our metals recycling and fabrication teams, our customers and our vendors. Everyone contributed to the performance. Our own steel consuming businesses purchased 1.5 million tons of steel from our steel mills, representing 14% of our total 2020 steel shipments. Clearly, another example of the strength of our vertical operating platforms to mitigate risk and increase through-cycle earnings. As a result of the pandemic, an estimated 15 million tons of higher cost domestic blast furnace flat-rolled steel production was idled in early 2020. Since that time, we believe between 5 million to 6 million tons of net production capacity has resumed. We believe that some of the idle capacity will be permanently off-line due to the high cost required to restart and maintain their operations. We believe this supports our flat roll supply-demand balance theses that the impending additional flat roll capacity will not cause a material supply side imbalance as there are only approximately 6 million tons of new capacity that is planned to start in the next 12 months. Combined with the capacity already restarted, it still doesn't match the tons taken off-line in early 2020. While the overall domestic steel industry operated at 68% utilization, the strength of our differentiated business model, coupled with the passion of our people drove steel dynamics' utilization rate to 86%. Even more remarkable, our flat-rolled steel mills achieved utilization of 97% through the year. In tough environments, the strength of our people and our unique business model becomes even more powerful. As demonstrated this year, during periods of market inflection, we maintained higher volumes compared to our peers, and we gained market share. Uninterrupted low-cost operations help provide customer optionality, value-added product and end market diversification provides flexibility for our commercial teams to go get orders. Unique supply chain solutions create customer value, making us a preferred supplier. And as I mentioned, our internal manufacturing businesses provide meaningful utilization support. We're in an extremely tight flat roll market right now, we can't even supply our internal operations to the extent they would like. Underlying demand for flat-rolled steel recovered much more quickly than expected, coupled with already extremely low supply chain inventories, the flat-rolled steel supply environment tightened in the second half of 2020 and remains extremely tight today. Customers are not yet rebuilding inventory due to limited availability and the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher-priced inventory. They appear to be ordering for only immediate needs. As for trade, we believe existing country agreements and legislative steel trade cases that are in place will continue to moderate imports. From an end market perspective, the North American automotive sector has experienced the most rapid rebound, already operating at pre-COVID levels with expectations of production in 2020 of around 16 million units or more. The nonresidential construction sector remains steady as evidenced by record structural and rail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlogs. Residential construction has also been strong, generating high demand for related HVAC and appliance products. We're also beginning to see improvements in mining and yellow and green goods at our Engineered Bar Products Division. A slight offset is steel consumption related to the energy sector, which remains historically weak, but is seeing glimpses of turnaround. We are continuing our impressive growth - margin-enhancing growth. We have recently executed several strategic investments that we believe will meaningfully benefit our future through-cycle earnings and free cash flow position. We expanded 2 steel mills by adding 440,000 tons of annual steel rebar production capability, adding product diversification and differentiated customer supply chain. This end market diversification supports higher through-cycle utilization for our structural and Roanoke Bar Steel divisions. The Heartland operations acquired in 2018, continue to expand. The team has been operating at record levels, providing additional internal value-added flat roll production support and operational flexibility for our Butler Flat Roll Division. The acquisition of United Steel Supply has also been an excellent investment. As a regional distributor of prepainted flat-rolled steel construction products, they provide a strategic channel to new, more diversified customers. Our combined brand is powerful in these markets, establishing us as the clear supplier of choice. Since the acquisition of Columbus Flat Roll Division, we have meaningfully increased its through-cycle earnings capability. We have transformed its product portfolio with the expansion of value-added steel products and customer end markets. The team achieved another milestone in July 2020, with a start-up of the new 400,000-ton value-added metallic coating line. Columbus now has 4 value-added coating lines. The investment reduces Columbus's hot-rolled coil exposure and provides a ready southern hot band consumer base for our new Sinton, Texas electric-arc-furnace flat-rolled steel mill when it starts operating later this year. The Sinton investment will be another transformational step function increase to through-cycle cash flow generation, providing next-generation EAF steel production capabilities, new products and new customers. The team's momentum is absolutely unbelievable and to be admired. When you tour the site the excitement there is palpable. We have an incredible depth of experience in the construction, start-up and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we likely have more relevant experience than any other company in the industry. Construction is going well and it's beyond exciting to know we'll be producing steel this coming summer. The new 3 million tons state of the art flat-rolled steel mill will include 2 value-added coating lines, comprised of a 550,000 ton galvanizing line and 250,000 ton paint line. These lines will likely start ahead of the full mill in the second quarter this year using either internally supplied or purchased steel substrate. Our new electric-arc-furnace steel mill is adhering to the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high-quality sustainable steel. Our existing electric arc furnace steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steelmaking technology. With an 84-inch coil width up to 1 inch thick 100 KSI product, our Texas mill will have product capabilities beyond existing flat-rolled steel producers, competing even more effectively with the integrated steel model and steel imports. The town of Sinton provides a strategic location near the Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional commercial markets for our new steel mill, which represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption. In the Southern and Western United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with the steel imports arriving through Houston and the West Coast. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat-rolled steel supplier, we have 3 customers committed to locate on site, representing over 1 million tons of annual processing and consumption capacity. We're still speaking with several other potential on-site customers as well, those that may build facilities off-site but near our campus. Our location provides a significant freight benefit to most of our intended flat roll customers. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we believe the potential custom savings will be at least $20 to $30 per ton, and some would be much higher. This freight advantage, coupled with much shorter lead times, provides a superior customer supply chain solution, allowing us to be a preferred domestic steel supplier in the southern and Western U.S. and Mexico. It allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We have also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company in August, which I deem a critical step. The acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the U.S. and Mexico. The operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico, and prior to our ownership, they shipped 500,000 gross tons of scrap annually, but they have an estimated annual processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons. We plan to increase the volume quickly and have already had success in doing so. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. We're not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage, and offer a sustainable alternative to regional imports. Our unique culture and the execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, differentiating us from others and demonstrating our sustainability. This has clearly been demonstrated during 2020. Again, our commitment is the health and safety of our people, our families and our communities, all while supporting our vendors, serving our customers and sustaining our value creation journey. Our leadership team and our 10,000 strong SDI family drives our success. Collectively, they are second to none. I thank each of you for your passion, strength and commitment to one another during these uncharted times. You truly drive us to excellence. And finally, a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the health care providers and their families, both within Steel Dynamics and those serving individuals across the world. Thank you, and be safe. Be well. So Kevin, please open the call for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld from Exane BNP Paribas. Seth Rosenfeld : If I can kick off please with the question on kind of how we're seeing the market develop in the near term. I think everyone on the line's, at this point, quite excited by the strength of the market right now, but skittish on the outlook going into 2021 with prices where they are. Wondering if you can comment on how you're seeing your order book develop in recent weeks? Has there been any slowdown in order intake due to high prices and some concern about price moment and maybe inflecting in the coming months, are we still seeing the same strength you've already talked through that benefited your Q4 performance? Mark Millett : Well, certainly, I think it's intrigued that one keeps hearing about the issues with the market because - I'm sorry, I don't know whether you heard that. I may have been on mute. But it's intriguing to me that there's concern about the strength of the market because right now, it is absolutely incredible. I know the supply side tightness, but demand is very, very, very, strong. Automotive recovered, and it's going to be 16 million units or so this year and probably more. And that's very, very strong and for us, we continue to gain market share, both at flat roll and engineered bar. We see residential construction is very, very strong. We can't supply enough steel currently to appliance, HVAC. Garage - metal garage door panels are incredibly strong. So that's a very a good sector. And although people are a little concerned about perhaps ABI numbers coming off a little bit, we certainly don't see that in our order book. As both Theresa and I have said, we have record sort of booking in the backlog at our fabrication platform. The retail shift to online sort of purchasing is really driving massive expansion of the warehouses - distribution warehouses. And cloud computing, likewise, is increasing dramatically and has a considerable build-out, too. And if you look at just the momentum, the Steel Joist Institute bookings for last year was 17% up year-over-year at 1.36 million tons. That's a considerable market. Just below their previous record back in 2007. 2020 shipments were up 7%, and we're seeing that momentum carry into this year, and we are very, very happy with where we are from a backlog perspective. Theresa Wagler : I think, Jim Anderson, this morning told me the market is \"red hot.\" Mark Millett : Yes. So they're a pretty excited team. Let me tell you. And then you get further down into the demand, you look at the truck trailer material handling. Again, they were anticipating a little bit of a flat to down year, but they are - actually changed that. We're anticipating they're going to be up 20% or more. Yellow goods, green goods, we're seeing very, very, very strong demand, and they're telling us at least the, again we don't know what they're doing with other customer - suppliers. But our order book is going to be substantially up throughout this year. Solar is a growing marketplace and a surprisingly large marketplace. And the only real sort of weak area is the oil patch, and we're seeing glimpses of light even there. But they - typically, even in a strong market, they're only 8% of the total marketplace. So it's not a massive, massive impact. So just generally, we see a very, very positive perspective out there. Our order books are incredibly strong. I wish we could make a lot more steel today because we could certainly sell a lot more steel. And we see it sustaining or persisting through the year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Curt Woodworth from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : Mark, just had a couple of questions around - you talked about the paint line starting up before the mill. At this point, when do you expect first coil production at Sinton? And is the plan to light both EAFs at the same time? Because I know it's kind of a different configuration with dual EAFs but a single caster. So just curious what the time line is looking like? Mark Millett : Well, the second question, absolutely. We'll be starting both furnaces up at the same time because we're expecting a strong ramp. And I think it's exciting. Again, even through the challenges of last year, that the project still remains on schedule for a summer start-up. And as Theresa said, it's still remaining on a $1.9 billion budget. And if you have seen the - you get on our website and take a look at the drone video that we continually update each year - I don't know, once a month or - not each year. Once a month... Theresa Wagler : Not each year. Applicable [indiscernible]. Mark Millett : Yes, you see a big difference each year. But it's - they're making remarkable progress, and it's a massive project. So they've done incredibly well. That doesn't mean to say there haven't been some zigs and zags along the way and likely have some more to come. But the team has done an outstanding job, I think, overcoming the challenges. We have had a few COVID-related delays in equipment and actually more impactful was ocean freight, getting ships to bring it here. But that's no longer an issue. And fortunately, none of that was on the critical path for the project. So again, timing for the project is still on time for a summer start. As I said, the coating lines, the paint line, the galvanizing line and likely the pickle line should be in good shape for the second quarter. Likely as kind of a May-June start there. And we'll be supplying substrate from Columbus likely and purchasing some substrate from third parties. Operator : Next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Timna Tanners : I wanted to just ask a little bit about the CapEx. It looks like maybe you're a little light in 2020, and that's the explanation for the higher value for 2021, but wanted to get a little bit more color on how that's progressing. And had heard that Sinton was starting a little later because of COVID delays, but sounds like that's not the case. So if you could clarify those items, please? Theresa Wagler : Yes, no problem, Timna. From a CapEx perspective, you're actually exactly correct. Simply had about $100 million that shifted from the fourth quarter of 2020 into the first half of 2021. So wherein, as last quarter, I would have suggested CapEx for 2021 would be about $850 million. It's now about $950 million. Unlikely, about $600 million to $700 million of the $950 million will be spent in the first half of the year. As it relates to the time line of Sinton, Mark? Mark Millett : Yes. I think, Timna, we've always advertised sort of a summer start-up, and that's not changed. Internally, we may have had some more aggressive goals as we typically do within SDI, and if the sun and moon aligned, maybe we could have started up 6 weeks or so earlier. But again, I've got absolutely no problems, no concerns there right now. Everything is progressing well, and the team is doing a phenomenal job. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Christopher Terry : Mark and Theresa. I had a question just around working capital. As we think about 2021 and the higher price environment and then also the integration of Sinton. I just wondered if you could talk through maybe a first half and second half '21 expectations on working capital. Theresa Wagler : Yes, absolutely. Chris. From the perspective of Sinton stand-alone, Sinton is likely to have a working capital ramp of somewhere around $130 million to $150 million, including all of the inventory and receivables. That will be a ramp. So in the second half of the year. You might get some of the raw materials, so maybe $50 million to $60 million in the first half. But most of that will come second half of 2021 and then into the first half of 2022. As it relates to company-wide working capital, you would have seen that we did have a draw of about $200 million in the fourth quarter related to primarily pricing of raw materials and of finished goods that would be in inventory at that point in time. You're likely to see a bit more of a draw as we're expecting to have higher prices and volumes sustained into the first quarter, but not as much of a draw as you saw in the fourth quarter. So I would say the first half, you're going to see a draw more than you typically would see. Second half, you'd see that moderate. Christopher Terry : And then just in terms of the overall capital structure and the buyback, how are you thinking about that in terms of Sinton in the middle of the year and maybe second half? Theresa Wagler : So from a capital allocation perspective, obviously, we're still focused on a big capital investment year in 2021. That being said, the cash flow generation that we've been having is quite strong, and we would expect to see that continue in 2021. So from a capital allocation perspective, we would expect to see the positive dividend profile continue. Once Sinton is up and running, that's likely going to be an opportunity for another kind of step function increase in our dividend policy as we like to grow the dividend with sustainable free cash flow. As we have excess cash flow along the way, that's with the share buyback programs for it's to complement the dividend profile because we see the dividends as forever. So you're likely to see us start to look for opportunities potentially from time to time in the market from a share buyback once we get past more of the larger spend for Sinton in the first half of the year. Mark, is that... Mark Millett : Yes. Theresa Wagler : Okay. Operator : Our next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Mark and Theresa. Just in terms of the potential infrastructure package, there are comments about $1.5 billion potential stimulus in the second half of the year. How do you see that benefit still demand in the U.S. and steel dynamics in particular? I don't know if you can - you have a sense of the volumes or - yes, that you could benefit from it. Mark Millett : I think the - it's certainly more than likely that we will see an infrastructure package, as you know, which is going to be a great sort of general benefit. But right now, it's difficult to discern where those dollars are going to be spent specifically and hence, where the impact will be from a volume perspective. Certainly, just the upward momentum that it will provide the economy in general will certainly help us. And any actual infrastructure, steel consuming infrastructure projects will be to our benefit. But to actually try to estimate, calculate a volume when you don't really know where the dollars are going to be spent, I think that it would be disingenuous for us to suggest. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : I just want to ask a little bit about the scrap market and how scrap costs are flowing through the results? Just obviously, historically, steel dynamics has - typically reports quarter-over-quarter changes in scrap costs that are typically less than the change that we've seen in the public market or domain. But this quarter was a pretty big spread. And I'm just wondering, is any of that timing related? Should we be thinking about - how should we be thinking about the first quarter in terms of the scrap input costs? And also if you could just also share your views on the near-term outlook on scrap beyond what looks to be down in February? Theresa Wagler : Yes. I'm going to let Mark talk about the scrap markets. But as it relates to the scrap flows, there really hasn't been any change. We're still turning inventories on a monthly basis, both at the mills recycling operations, and we tend to keep somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks on the ground at the steel mills. So I can't really address why it may have been greater than you typically see, but there hasn't been a change in how we're using or accounting for the scrap. Mark Millett : Yes. Well, I guess, the only impact would be it's such a rapid increase in a short period of time, and you're seeing the difference between the market and our inventory. But just in the scrap market as a whole, obviously, it's gone up some the last month or two, quite considerably. We would imagine that we'll retreat from the current highs or moderate somewhat. It's not going to take all a couple of hundred dollars back, but it's going to retreat, we believe, because the strong pricing is driven a substantial increase in the flow, particularly the obsolete grades. People are out there collecting it's flowing in dramatically, and the industry has actually dropped the scale prices. And so I would expect the market prices to drop over the next couple of months. For prime scrap, flows are fully reestablished in connectivity with the automotive business coming back. We expect prices there to soften, but not quite as much as obsolete grades. So the shred to prime spread will likely expand a little more than it is today. And we think the export market will remain relatively soft. And so there's - again, we feel pricing is going to moderate. I think despite China listing its import restrictions, it's not going to impact the ferrous market dramatically, not in the U.S. anyway. But it is going to give us - or has given us significant upside on nonferrous. Obviously, as many of you know the nonferrous, the copper, aluminum absorber, those sorts of grades, really didn't have much of a home for the last year or so. With them opening up, they're able to increase the margins there. So I think that's a positive for us. Operator : Our next question is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Just a follow-up on scrap actually and something we've talked to you about before as well about availability of scrap in the U.S. market. I think you guys have always maintained your view that there is plenty of scrap in the U.S. market for everyone to go around. Does that change now given the new import rules in China? I mean, China obviously reopening that goes for seaborne scrap. And it's obviously not a large seaborne market. So do you think do you think that could go in and kind of tighten the market and maybe even lead to some consolidation of mills in the U.S. they're buying more scrap yards in the same way you guys did in Mexico recently? Or do you still see the U.S. scrap market pretty well supplied? That's my question. Mark Millett : Well, I can't speak for other companies. I would suggest that, as we've said in the past, we will expand or grow to support our steel mills regionally. So we did that. We bought some Sims yards around our Columbus facility, just to baseload that mill. And Zimmer, obviously, is destined to supply some scrap to Sinton quite cost effectively. So you may see us, again, just add smaller opportunities, but we're not going to be in consolidating the whole scrap market or anything like that, for sure. Regarding scrap supply, I think you're seeing what has been typical in the past. Scrap is incredibly elastic. Certainly, the obsolete grades are incredibly elastic and has - as scrap pricing has increased dramatically in the last month or 2, it's amazing how folks get out there and that flow increases dramatically. And so I don't see a long-term issue with scrap supply in any way shape or form. Theresa Wagler : I think one just has to - so as we look at scrap generation, we see it continuing to increase. We see it increasing even more quickly than potentially some of the additional demand that will be derived from some of the new EAF capacity coming online domestically. But one also has to look at the additional HBI, DRI and other projects that are either coming online, have been announced or being contemplated by even the blast furnace participants. So I think there should be ample raw material as Mark's said. Mark Millett : And with the rationalization of the integrated side of the industry, it's quite possible that you just start to see them actually produce pig iron, which would help the supply balance - supply-demand balance as well. Operator : Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Philip Gibbs : Theresa, the question I had was just on the flat-rolled shipments by grade, if you had that handy? Theresa Wagler : Yes. I'm sorry, I made you ask, I skipped over. I didn't mean to. So hot-rolled and P&O for the quarter was 749,000 tons, cold rolled, 139,000 tons, and coated products were 973,000 tons for a total of about 1.9 million tons of flat roll. Philip Gibbs : And the coated number again, I'm sorry? Theresa Wagler : The coated number was 973,000 tons. Operator : Next question is coming from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent. John Tumazos : The forward curve for the hot-rolled sheet contract is over 6 months, down $367. I'm not sure I understand that. But do you think the forward curve reflects new supply, so let's just say 1 million tons more flat rolled, 1 million tons more long products? Or do you think the forward curve reflects a fall in the price of iron units? Your mill is only going to be 0.25 million tons a month. Not 1 million or 2 million tons a month and you'll probably just be striking an arc by August where the forward curve is down $367. It seems to me that market's anticipating a lot of supply. I'm not sure where it is, but I appreciate your view, Mark? Mark Millett : Well, John, simply, I don't understand it either. Again, as I tried to suggest earlier, this isn't just a supply side tightness. Demand, the markets are incredibly strong and robust right now. And we see that persisting. Certainly very, very, very strong first half, and I think it's going to continue into the second half. And I don't see any appreciable change or driver out there to change that. To your point, okay, we're out a few tons here, incremental tons relatively to the market anyway, the second half of the year. Big River reportedly is running. We don't see them in the marketplace necessarily, but they have got their capacity up and running pretty strong from all reports. So there's not that additional capacity there. So I don't see where the relief is going to be. I don't see, to be honest, the Biden administration changing the trade environment materially, at least not near term. I think they recognize that China is a massive threat. Their approach to them might be different than the Trump administration. They will likely ally with our friends in Europe and in places. But they're not - they will likely change 2.32, but I think they will be very cognizant that there needs to be trade controls there. And there are underlying legislative trade constraints in place that aren't just an executive order, they're legislated, and they're going to be there for years to come, Section 201 countervailing duties and [indiscernible]. So I don't see necessarily the - an import flood. The arbitrage certainly has grown to China. But nonetheless, lead times are months and months out. And you see some specialty items coming in, but I don't see any dramatic change in the import profile. So I don't see where the pressure comes off the accelerator to drop $370 here in the next, whatever it is, 6 months. So I agree. I don't understand it either. We don't see - we certainly don't see it within the fundamental drivers of the marketplace. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Tyler Kenyon from Cowen and Company. Tyler Kenyon : Mark and Theresa. Certainly as you've addressed some potential tailwinds for coming from infrastructure spending. But I was just curious if you had any thoughts on how the suspension of border wall construction and the cancellation of the XL pipeline, how that could maybe impact the steel demand and/or scrap supply. I mean, I think we were reading through the Department of Homeland Security that pretty close to 700,000 tons of steel has been consumed since 2008 on the border wall. So yes, the question is, how do you see that impacting the market? And has steel dynamics been participating in supplying steel to any of these projects? Mark Millett : Well, I think the border wall, to be honest, was relatively incremental. We didn't see much of that product. And that tends to be at the low end, commodity hot band side of the business that we tend not to play in, to any great extent anyway. So - but I don't see that as a massive impact to demand. Theresa Wagler : The XL pipeline is hard to tell how much that may have an influence and what the Biden administration may do going forward with additional kind of oil and gas, obviously, is not going to help. From that perspective as Mark said, at least in the fourth quarter, which was prior to some of these things happening, we were starting to see some orders come in from those customers, both at Columbus and at our Engineered Bar Products Division, where we would have the most impact. But I just think it's a little too early to tell. Mark Millett : Well, and that pipeline - actually, our pipeline, to be honest, a massive amount of that pipe has already been made and is laying on the ground. So it's not going to have a massive impact. Tyler Kenyon : Got it. And then just, Theresa, just 1 last one, just on cash taxes, if your, I think in the last call, you guided to a pretty, pretty low cash tax rate. Just curious if that's changed significantly? And maybe how we should be thinking about that rate moving even into 2022? Theresa Wagler : Well, in 2021, the provisions that allow us to expense the fixed asset investment once we start-up Sinton are still in place. So as long as those provisions are still in place, we'll be able to basically pay maybe 3% state cash taxes in 2020 and likely remain very low - I'm sorry, in 2021 and likely remain very low in 2022 as well. But obviously, we need to watch the administration and things that may change according to that. But right now, we're still planning on the benefit in total being somewhere around $300 million to $350 million of cash tax savings between 2021 and 2022. Operator : Our next question today is a follow-up from David Gagliano from BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : Just to circle back on the scrap question, sorry to ask another scrap question. Just on the near term, it's to help calibrate expectations on our side. If we start with the assumption that scrap prices actually don't change for the remainder of the quarter. I realize that's not the view, but if we assume that they don't change, just from a timing perspective, what should we expect for the scrap cost change quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter? Theresa Wagler : Well, again, for us, David, from a scrap mix perspective, the mills keep 3 to 4 months on hand. So whatever your estimation would be from - I'm sorry, weeks on hand. So whatever your estimation would be from an index perspective, you can just apply that, and you're going to get very close to what will actually happen. Operator : We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back for any further or closing comments. Mark Millett : Well, to those on the phone still, we certainly appreciate you're listening in and you're supportive of your company. And I think it's just one last comment that, I guess, didn't really come out clearly. People are focused on price, and it's not price that matters, we're a margin. We're a metal spread business. And again, we anticipate a very strong demand year that's going to support pricing on the price side on the market side. Supply side, inventories remain very, very low. We expect import activity to remain very moderate. A significant portion of the idled blast furnace capacity, we expect to remain down, and lead times are extended. So you couple that with a moderating scrap environment, we see that metal spreads themselves are going to persist sort of higher than the normal through-cycle levels and should be very, very helpful for us, and we're anticipating a remarkable year, in all honesty. That being said, to our customers out there, folks, we had an absolutely phenomenal year - last year, and we couldn't do it without you. So thank you for your support. Similarly for our vendors and service providers. Thank you. And most importantly, thank you to each and every employee out there. It was an absolutely tremendous year. I think it vulcanizes or just affirms our business model, that we are a differentiated company. To make $1 billion of free cash in a year like that, I think just spells out clearly that we're a different company today. And with Sinton coming online, it's going to add 25% to our steelmaking capability. That's going to be a significant step function increase in our through-cycle cash generation. So we've done a phenomenal job, and we're going to keep doing it, and we can't do it without each and every one of you. So thank you. Go ahead, have a great day. Be safe, stay healthy. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled in the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Record First Quarter 2021 Results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Tricia. Good morning, everybody. Hey, I had you folks on mute, but welcome to our first quarter '21 earnings call. We certainly appreciate you joining us today. I believe the entire Steel Dynamics team delivered a tremendous first quarter performance. It was filled with operating and financial records, including record net sales, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. It was an extraordinary performance yet again, driven by the dedication and passion of our teams. I'm incredibly proud to work with each of them. They're a special group, accomplishing exceptional things. Due to the continued commitment of our teams to one another, our families and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID-19. Operations have continued essentially unabated. We continue to closely monitor the situation and adapt as necessary to ensure our teams' health. The health and welfare of our teams is the highest priority. And I think each of them for their continued commitment to our safety. Because record results don't matter unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. The number of injuries and their severity improved in the first quarter '21 compared to last year. The teams are focused on reducing hazards and practices that could result in significant injury. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people. Safety is and always will be our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry statistics. But our intent will always be the drive towards zero incident work environments. To achieve this, we must all continuously be aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keeping safety top of mind to control safety, both in the traditional sense as it relates to keeping one another in good health. Before I continue further, Theresa will provide insights into our recent performance. So Theresa? Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I want to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark said we achieved numerous milestones and delivered a record first quarter performance. We achieved record revenues of $3.5 billion derived from near record quarterly steel shipments, record fabrication shipments and strong product pricing across all of our operating platforms. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $594 million and net income of $431 million or $2.03 per diluted share. And we had strong cash flow from operations of $262 million with a record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $664 million, truly an extraordinary performance. Our first quarter 2021 results included costs of approximately $20 million or $0.07 per diluted share associated with the construction of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $445 million or $2.10 per diluted share above our guidance of $1.94 to $1.98 due to stronger than anticipated March steel shipments as order activity remains very strong. Our first quarter 2021 revenues of $3.5 billion were 36% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, with growth from all of our operating platforms, and most significantly from our steel and metal recycling operations based on record flat roll steel selling values and strong shipments. Our first quarter 2021 operating income was $594 million, $335 million, or 130% higher than sequential fourth quarter results due to higher real life flat roll steel pricing more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, you'll find we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2021. And we are confident in our fourth coming unique earnings catalysts. For steel operations we generated $641 million of operating income in the first quarter more than double fourth quarter sequential earnings as flat roll steel selling values increased significantly to record levels throughout the first quarter, driving expanded metal margins. We also saw expanded margins within our long products operations based on higher prices. First quarter steel shipments of 2.8 million tons were 6% above our sequential fourth quarter volume and only 25,000 tons less than our quarterly record set in the first quarter of 2020. Our steel mills operated at 93% of their capability during the quarter well above the industry average of 77%. As a reminder, we still have additional market share opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons and when we finish our new Texas steel mill and it's fully online, we'll have over 16 million tons. As domestic steel production increased scrap demand strengthened in the first quarter, resulting in significantly higher scrap prices and resulting metal spread expansion. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $54 million, nearly 100% improvement sequentially. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our vertically connected operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing companywide working capital requirements. Despite record first quarter 2021 shipments for our steel fabrication segment, first quarter operating income was $10 million, compared to sequential fourth quarter earnings of $25 million. Lower earnings were the result of metal spread compression, as higher average selling values were offset by significantly higher steel input costs. As evidenced through our record shipments, record order backlog and extremely strong continued order activity, lower first quarter earnings is not reflective of a weaker demand environment. It is a matter of timing, as higher steel costs are being matched with a six-month order backlog in which joist and deck prices were lower. This will begin to reverse in the coming months as current steel joist and deck prices have increased considerably. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2021, we generated cash flow from operations of $262 million. Operational working capital grew $411 million during the quarter driven by higher customer account and inventory values due to increased pricing in shipments. During the quarter we also invested $310 million in capital investments, of which $254 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill. For the remainder of 2021, we estimate capital investments will be roughly $650 million to $700 million, with the Texas steel mill representing about $535 million of that amount. This estimate does not include spending for construction or the recently announced four flat roll steel coating lines. We believe the lines will cost between $400 million and $425 million combined, and we will likely fund between $50 million to $75 million for engineering and down payments late this year. The lines are currently planned to begin operating sometime in the second half of 2022. In February, we also increased our cash dividend 4% to $0.26 per common share based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend over 85% and invested $1.3 billion in our common stock, representing over 15% of our outstanding shares. We have $444 million that remain authorized for share repurchases. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation, consistent cash flow generation, strong liquidity profile and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. We're in a position of strength, with liquidity over $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter, comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes responsible strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of the base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also being dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. And we believe sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation. And we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. We produce steel using only Electric Arc Furnace technology with recycled ferrous scrap as the primary raw material. EAS steel production technology currently has the least environmental impact, is the most cost effective and provides the most operational flexibility. With the addition of our mills recycling and fabrication platforms, we intentionally developed a vertically connected operating model crane and almost closed loop manufacturing business, which both benefits us financially and reduces our environmental impact. In 2020, we shared our qualitative climate related goals and our most recent sustainability report. This summer, we also plan to adopt quantitative goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, participate in greater renewable energy use and continue to invest in energy efficiency opportunities. We're currently in the process of assessing the use of renewable energy alternatives at our steel mills. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey. And we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. For those of you that use our detailed shipments for the flat roll product for your models, in the first quarter of 2021, we have hot-rolled P&O shipments of 774,000 tons, cold-rolled of 149,000 tons and coated of 996,000 tons. On a personal note, I just want to continue to thank the teams for operating safely and for taking care of one another from a health perspective as well. Mark? Mark Millett : Thanks Theresa. Taking on operating platforms in turn, the steel fabrication platform delivered a strong performance, achieving record quality shipments while navigating rapidly escalating steel input costs, higher steel costs compressed first quarter steel fabrication earnings due to a matching six-month order backlog to more current steel prices. However, based on the strength of steel joist and deck and demand we're currently placing orders at record prices. Our order activity is extremely strong. We ended March with a record fabrication order backlog that is over 50% higher than our previous peak. The non-residential construction market remains strong especially in areas that support online retail, computing activities and healthcare, specifically represented by construction of large distribution and warehouse facilities. Driven large part to changes in consumer behavior, we believe this dynamic will continue for the next several years. We already have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the US and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad based customer supply chain. In order to serve increased customer demand, we will be expanding our production capability. For us it is not necessary to add physical assets, we simply will be providing jobs to additional team members to support increased operating hours, thereby further improving asset utilization. These new crews will be trained and become active between now and late summer '21, increasing our annual production capability by as much as 25% to 30% or over 100,000 tons. Our metals recycling operations had an extremely strong quarter with quarterly operating income of $54 million, nearly doubling sequential fourth quarter earnings and over five times higher than prior year first quarter earnings. Strong ferrous demand and increased pricing related to higher domestic steel production drove strong performance. Prime scrap index pricing increased over $170 per gross ton during the first quarter. Prime scrap generation is strong based on North American manufacturing. We expect North American scrap generation to outpace increased demand from steelmaking in 2021. Obsolete scrap generation has also been strong post the extreme February weather conditions. Based on continued solid scrap generation, we believe scrap pricing will remain somewhat steady during the rest of the year. As Theresa mentioned, the steel team had an outstanding quarter, achieving numerous operating and financial records. We achieved near record shipments, just 1% less than our first quarter 2020 record, and up 6% sequentially. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $641 million, over 10% higher than our previous peak. So many contributed to these incredible achievements, including our commercial teams, our other operating platforms, suppliers and especially our loyal customers. While the domestic steel industry operated at an increased utilization rate of 77% during the first quarter, the strength of our differentiated business model, combined with a passion of our people drove our steel production utilization to 93%. Steel demand is strong across the steel platform, including both flat and long steel products. However, the flat roll steel markets remain especially tight. Underlying demand for flat roll steel products recovered much more quickly than expected in the second half of last year and gained further momentum in this recent first quarter. When coupled with historically low customer inventory levels across the supply chain, flat roll steel prices have been supported at historically high levels and customers are placing orders for immediate demand requirements. They have not rebuilt inventories since the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher priced inventory is a significant deterrent, even if it was available. Additionally, we believe current legislative steel trade policies will continue to moderate steel imports. The current US administration has also commented constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues with China. From an end market perspective, the automotive sector has experienced the strongest recovery operating at very high production levels due to low inventories coupled with strong consumer demand. March's seasonally adjusted production represented almost 18 million units and inventories were close to 30% below the five-year average. We've been fortunate that our automotive order book has not seen any significant impact from the current electronic chip shortens. The non-residential construction sector remains strong with continued positive momentum, as evidenced by record structural and rail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments and strong customer backlogs. We expect this strength to continue through the rest of this year and certainly into next year. Residential construction has also been strong, producing high demand for related HVAC and appliance products. In addition to supporting high non-residential construction demand, the growing online retail shift is supporting steel demand strength throughout the supply chain service providers such as truck trailer and material handling. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining and yellow goods customers that are engineered by our products division. In the energy sector, solar is a substantially growing market. And we're also seeing some indications of improved oil and gas activity. We continue on our successful track record and margin enhancing differentiated growth. We have executed numerous strategic investments across the company in the last several years. And we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future. Our teams and our customers are extremely excited about our Sinton Texas Electric Arc Furnace Flat Roll Steel Mill investment. It represents a transformational step function increase in Steel Dynamics through cycle cash flow generation capability. It provides next generation electric arc furnace steel production capabilities, new products and new customers. The facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers competing even more effectively with a higher carbon emitting integrated steel model and foreign competition. It provides us with a broader steel portfolio and provides our customers with an even larger climate conscious supply option. The team's momentum is unbelievable and to be admired. We have an incredible depth of experience in the construction, startup and operation of large steel manufacturing assets. Collectively, we likely have more relevant experience than any other company in the industry. And construction is going extremely well. The new 3-million-ton state of the art flat roll steel mill will include two value added coating lines comprise the 550,000 ton galvanizing line with Galvalume capability and a 250,000 paint line. We plan for these two value-added coating lines to begin operating by the end of the second quarter '21 using flat roll substrate that had full operations. Our Sinton Electric Arc Furnace Steel Mill is adhering to the same stringent sustainability model as our other steelmaking facilities, utilizing state of the art environmental controls and processes to produce high quality sustainable lower carbon steel. Our steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average traditional steelmaking technology. The Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi. We have three targeted regional commercial markets for unused steel mill which represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the southern and western United States and Mexico. We also plan to effectively compete with steel imports. Our customers are excited to have a regional flat roll steel supplier. We have four customers committed to locate on site representing over 1.3 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability. We're still speaking with several other potential on site customers, as well as those that are building facilities off site yet near our campus. Our location provides a significant free benefit to most of our intended flat roll customers. Compared to the current domestic supply options, we believe that potential customer savings would be at least $20 to $30 per ton and some would be much higher. Coupled with much shorter lead times we can provide a superior customer supply chain solution. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports, which inherently have long lead times and speckled that price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company last August, which was a critical step for us. The acquisition complements our current metals recycling business in both the US and Mexico. The operations are strategically located near high volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. They have an estimated annual scrap processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons. We also acquired three small scrap locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area to help serve Sinton's raw material needs. Our performance based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets, positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. As we've said before, we're not simply adding a flat roll steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer an import sustainable alternative to a regional in need of options. We've also recently announced plans to add four additional value-added flat roll coating lines, comprised with two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Galvalume products represent the fastest growing flat roll steel market in the United States, primarily serving the metal building industry. This market is historically sourced as much as 45% of the needs from foreign imports. Our preferred cost effective supply chain has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at full capacity through both increased consumption and market share again. Two of these lines will be located in the southern US region to be comprised of a new paint line, and a galvanizing slash Galvalume line, with a combined annual coating capacity of 540,000 tons, requiring an estimated investment of $225 million. These lines will provide Sinton with similar diversification and higher margin product capabilities as our Butler in Columbus flat roll steel divisions. The remaining two lines will be located in the Midwest, and will also be comprised of a paint line and galvanizing line with Galvalume capability with a combined annual coating capacity of 540,000 tons and will require an investment of between $175 million and $200 million. These lines will support our regional flat roll steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customer needs. We currently believe these lines will begin operating in the second half of '22. Our strategy consistently places value added products and supply chain differentiation of the four and has benefit us well, both through good and poor markets. In closing, our culture and the execution of a long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through consistent strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation, clearly demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Our amazing teams provide the foundation for success. I thank each of them for their passion and dedication to each other and our other stakeholders. To each of you, please remember that your health and safety is always the most important issue at hand. I thank you for all you do. Your spirit of excellence drives us to success. With that said Darrell, would you please open the floor for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Sathish Kasinathan of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Sathish Kasinathan : Yeah, hi, good morning, Mark and Teresa. Thanks for taking my questions. So my question is on the flat roll steel pricing. In the past you have indicated that the flat rolled steel pricing typically lags by two months based on your mix of spot or index-based contracts. Given the external lead times, delivery delays and maybe changes to the contract mix, what would the lag be in terms of today's market? Theresa Wagler : That's a great question Sathish. So in the first quarter generally, we're somewhere between probably 55% to 60% contract business in any given quarter related to just our flat roll operations. But because of the way that contracts have minimum and maximum volumes, in the first quarter, we actually had probably a little over 70% of our mix was contract related. So it was more than we typically would have. However, going into the second quarter, you're likely to see that moderate back to a 60% to 65%. And so we think it'll get closer to what we normally see. And the lag is generally around two months. Sathish Kasinathan : Okay. Sorry. Just one follow up question if I may. At Sinton do you have like a target base load for the mill? And in terms of ongoing discussions with other customers, could you be able to quantify what the potential incremental volumes could be compared to the 1.3 million tons already committed? Theresa Wagler : We had the update - the customers that have committed to be on site. There's four in place today that represent just over 1.3 million tons. We're currently having discussions with at least two others. Mark, I don't know if you want to comment on the additional volume that may come with that or not? Mark Millett : Well, we would anticipate, I think, at the end of the day, with seven customers on site, it's been absolutely incredible, the excitement that we've seen, and we've been very, very intentional as to the type of customers such that we have a broad spectrum of processing capability. So light gauge processing capability, heavy gauge, hot band, automotive, and also pipe consumers and other fabricators. So I would imagine at the end of the day, again, that 1.3 million tons will grow. Again, that's not all consumption. A lot of it is processing capability. But it should end up being perhaps 1.4 million tons by the time we're done. Theresa Wagler : And just to add to that Sathish, we've actually had several customers that were not able to locate with us on site because of area constraints, et cetera. But there are those that are moving contingent or contiguous to the site. So there is a lot of excitement among the customer group. Sathish Kasinathan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Seth Rosenfeld with Exane BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. Seth Rosenfeld : Good morning, I guess the follow up please with regard to Sinton, can you provide any update or more details on the ramp up schedule for the facility, and when exactly you would expect to reach full utilization of 3 million tons? I think last quarter you noted downstream lines began ramp in late Q2 up in early Q3. Any update on those figures, please? Mark Millett : Certainly, I think the downstream lines, as we've said in the past will come up before the hot side, but the paint line, the galv line and pickle line, we believe will stop commissioning in June, with some limited shipments beginning in July. I think generally, volumes will be a little constrained through those three lines due to the strong SDI backlog right now and a limited availability of third-party volume. It was our anticipation some time ago that we will be transferring tons down there. But again, it's a good and a bad situation. Our mills are absolutely jam packed with orders. And again, it's tough to get third party supply. But those will be commissioned on time and we'll start to see incremental shipments in the third and fourth quarter. The hot strip mill obviously is of prime importance to get that up and running. That it will be commissioned in September. And I would expect the shipments to commence in Q4 and one has to recognize that as we start the mill up, we'll be also hiring to build working process inventory. So not every ton produced will be shipped. But I would imagine volume to be around 150,000 to 200,000 tons for the fourth quarter. For 2022, the expectation is still to ship around about 80% of eventual capability, so somewhere between 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons. Theresa Wagler : And that's from a full utilization as we run Columbus and Butler, basically at full or over full capacity. We don't see any reason why could achieve that in the 2023 timeframe. Seth Rosenfeld : Thank you, just a follow up with regards to the 2022 guidance, is the view that you'd be at the 80% run rate on an annual basis by the end of '22, or calendar '22, you expect that 2.2 million to 2.4 million ton out the door? Mark Millett : No, we would expect 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons of actual shipments. Seth Rosenfeld : Wonderful, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Emily Chang with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Emily Chang : Good morning, Mark and Teresa. My first question is just around sort of the capital allocation strategy. As you have the startup of Sinton quickly approaching and coupled with what looks like a phenomenal year for steel prices, how should we be thinking about longer term capital allocation policy? Should we be expecting more growth spend above and beyond the cutting line investments that you've recently announced? Or will there be maybe a more meaningful pivot to shareholder returns? Mark Millett : Well, I think generally our cash allocation strategy has been pretty consistent over time, and will continue to be so. We'll still be focused on retaining a conservative perspective regarding balance sheet structure and liquidity to fully support our investment grade profile. Our through cycle cash generation capability will remain strong, and obviously, with Sinton and with the additional projects will increase dramatically. And I think the exciting thing is, as you point out, we're going to have a lot of cash to allocate. We'll continue growth. We've announced our four new lines, again, a little sort of head of our own personal - sort of timeframe, to help diversify that mill dramatically along the lines of Butler and Columbus. But there will be significant cash remaining after that growth. We'll continue to have a positive dividend profile, cash dividend profile. And as you've seen in the past, when we have a step function increase in through cycle cash generation capability, we do quite a meaningful bump. So I would expect that to happen in the future the next year. And obviously, to supplement that that shareholder return was continuing to look at share buybacks. Theresa Wagler : I would just add, so there are transactional opportunities as well. And so we are a growth company. And so there is the organic side, which I think Sinton represents the largest project, and that we've had. But as you think about transaction opportunities, whether it's in manufacturing businesses that utilize our steel as raw material input, or whether it even the steel production assets perhaps that's something definitely we can differentiate the business and improve the business and add a lot of value. We're still very interested in things like that as well. Emily Chang : That's very helpful. And if I can squeeze in a quick follow up just on the infrastructure plan that's being floated right now. Any sort of early thoughts on what that could mean for steel demand longer term and your views as to whether or not there's sufficient capacity to meet this longer term? Mark Millett : Well, it's difficult to tell exactly what that sort of incremental volume is. You see 3 million, 4 million tons being bantered around. I can't say that we've fully analyzed that. But obviously, there will be improved demand. There's obviously a major sort of clean energy aspect to it. So solar, I think will help steel consumption demand and certainly our activities at Steel of West Virginia are already benefiting from that. I think beyond the actual sort of steel consumption perspective just the overall economic benefit from that and from other stimuli the economy is going great guns today and it's just going to keep it going. So it's an exciting time. Emily Chang : And I think that's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Gagliano : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wonder if we could switch gears to kind of current market conditions and looking ahead a bit here. Obviously, we've got this extremely tight market, record high prices, lead times still extended and we've seen a lot of I think low hanging fruit on the capacity side now restarted and everything still very tight. So typically, one of the ways you saw for this is imports. And I'm wondering if you could just comment on why this time should be different with regards to import flows being somewhat constrained. Given that we're at record high regional premiums, I think there's very good reasons for it. I was just wondering if you could share your thoughts. Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, again from our perspective, and there are those - I saw some commentary sort of questioning demand. Demand out there is absolutely phenomenal, across almost every sector. Very, very strong and it would appear to be there for the rest of this year going into next. As you mentioned, most of the - if not all, the reasonable production capability in the US has returned. I think any further additions will be limited. There are sort of additions coming in later this year. Ours will start shipments in the fourth quarter, as I said, but nothing major on the plus side. And it's going to be offset in all honesty, if you look at the maintenance outages in the integrated industry and some shutdowns on the minimal side of things, supply side will absolutely remain tight. So as a great balance will support the market. The issue in the past has been import increases. And I don't think you'll see - you're going to see material increase. It is picking up, there's no doubt about that. But you've got a world economy. Europe is strong, China is strong, most markets are in great shape and so the import availability today is not there. You may get the arbitrage to become more attractive perhaps on the surface. But the availability and the lead times are stretched out. And very few people are going to want to take that speculative risk buying whatever 1,400 bucks today, just taking that risk for that to tumble later in the year. We don't see that though. So we see strong demand, tight supply, record low supply chain inventories across the space. And I think imports - moderate levels of imports that will be continued to be supported by the administration. Actually, I think the commentary relative to trade is very, very positive. Today they recognize that we've been at a kind of a financial war with China for a long time. And they recognize the issues there and I don't think that the 232 tariffs will be unwound in totality. They may take a slightly different shape, but trade constraint will remain in the years ahead. So I think it's a remarkable environment that we're in today. And I think it's just wherever you look anecdotally - housing, there are no houses to be bought today. Or you saw a pickup in the residential markets in March. And that will continue and as playing strength in HVAC and appliance. If you go try and buy a refrigerator today or washing machine, you're probably going to have to wait four or five months for one that you actually want. So just everywhere you look in the supply chain things are stretched and will kind of prolong these cycles. So we're incredibly bullish, I mean it's - we had a phenomenal first quarter. I think the second quarter is going to be multiples of phenomenal and is going to be a great year. David Gagliano : Alright, that's helpful. Thanks for the additional color there. If I could just squeeze one more in as well, just switching back to what Teresa said earlier about use of cash down the road and transactional opportunities. I think you mentioned manufacturing business and/or still production assets. I'm not going to put you on the spot-on assets or anything like that. Just the question I'm really wondering is - you didn't mention organic steel production, so is it reasonable to assume that organic steel production, incremental organic steel production is off the table for now? Mark Millett : I would say on the hot side for sure. Downstream, coating, value-add there's still I think, a myriad of opportunities for us. But if you look at Sinton for - that investment, that project is very, very, very unique both from a product standpoint, but also sort of a market or regional market standpoint. And that's what persuaded us to move forward there. I don't believe there are those types of opportunities available today. Yeah, if there's - there may be incremental where we'll take existing hot metal capability and add assets to use that existing capability. But I don't believe you'll see us - I'm pretty sure you won't see us building green - any more greenfield hot sites. David Gagliano : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions from me and following up on the last comments. We obviously saw flat roll steel shipments declined a little bit year-on-year. I think you've hit 1.9, not significantly below, but is that because production constraints that shipments actually fell year-on-year? That's the first question. Theresa Wagler : Andreas, are you talking specifically about Steel Dynamics and our first quarter shipments? Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yeah. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. So it was a direct result of two of our steel divisions. We actually had improvement over all of our operations, except for Roanoke Bar Division and the Steel of West Virginia Division. And there have been some good improvements made there commercially and the team is doing incredibly well. And they think you're going to see a big shift and change in that. But that specifically, it wasn't anything that was noteworthy, and it was only about 25,000 tons difference, I think. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yeah. No, that's what I figured. Okay, that's very clear. And the second question, I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of talk in the market in recent quarters about the tightness of prime scrap and how the prime scrap market is going to grow even tighter with the EAF capacitors coming online, and so on so forth. And I'm sure you've seen some commentary, some people saying that EAFs are going to be the next high cost producers in the market and scrap prices are going to keep rolling and so on so forth. Where do you guys come down on all of this? I mean, effectively, is this just a question about you go a little bit further on the radius and basically collect a bit more prime scrap from other manufacturers and then there's sufficient supply of prime scrap for anybody who's willing to go a little bit further or do you see an actual amount of tightness in the market just given that manufacturing especially auto production is under pressure in the years to come? Mark Millett : Firstly, I would suggest that scrap is an incredibly efficient market. It's probably the most effective commodity. I do believe that yes, there's additional capacity electrical arc furnace capacity come online. But if you do the math, you may need to find about - somewhere around 4 million tons of additional prime scrap. You also have to offset that a little bit because people forget the integrated mills use scrap, they use prime scrap and so with the reduced capacity there, there's a little less consumed on the integrated side of things. But I think if you look at the scrap market in general, we - even in these recent times we're exporting in around 12 million, 15 million tons a year. There have been times when we've exported 20 million tons a year. So scrap is certainly available. It may appreciate in price to some degree, but I don't believe you're going to see any significant issues from a profitability or a cost perspective for the electric arc furnace community. Theresa Wagler : Andreas, as we look at - Andreas Bokkenheuser : That is very clear. Sorry, go ahead. Theresa Wagler : We pull together what we believe to be scrap generation over the coming years, and we added in new capacity related to electric arc furnaces. The scrap generation, both including prime scrap as well as prime scrap substitutes with a lot of the additional projects coming on line, we believe will outpace the increased demand. Though I know there's different philosophies being touted about out there right now. But that was our original promise and we still believe in that. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yeah. No, that makes a lot of sense. And I think your 4 million ton estimate is very much also in line with our own. So thank you very much for your comments. Mark Millett : I think actually one more thing because, as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. And given the remarkable spread between prime scrap and obsolete today, our mills and I'm sure all of our competition is doing the same thing. But they are creating new mixes. And we've actually reduced our prime scrap requirements probably by over 10%, maybe more at our flat roll facilities. If the whole industry, electric arc furnace flat roll producing industry would to do that obviously, that's a meaningful reduction as well. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you for the - Operator : Thank you. Our next question is comfortable a line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Carlos de Alba : Yeah, thank you very much. Just on the fabrication business. I think last quarter it was mentioned that the first quarter would be the bottom of the profitability cycle there. If I understood correctly, you said that this month probably - from this month on probably you start to see a margin expansion. So in fact can you elaborate a little bit more so that we fully understand where are we in the fabrication business profitability cycle? Yeah. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. Absolutely. Good morning. So from the steel fabrication, we're likely to see March and April be the drought months as we are working through or have worked through the order backlog. Today, steel and steel deck - steel joist and steel deck prices are actually at all-time record highs and demand is extraordinary. So one should see that starts to develop, it's already into a record backlog that's reaching into the fourth quarter of 2021. And you're likely to see a better second quarter, but in the second half of the year, it could be quite powerful from an earnings perspective. Carlos de Alba : Perfect. And if I made just a clarification on the CapEx, it is not much, but the Midwest. Two new coated lines are expected to cost a little bit more than those in the south. What is the reason for that if I may ask? Theresa Wagler : Yeah. Carlos, it's actually opposite. And we may have said it wrong. The $225 million lines are likely to be in the south. And the $175 million to $200 million lines are likely to be in the Midwest. Mark, do you want to talk about the technical differences between the sets of lines, why one might be higher than the other? Mark Millett : Well, quite simply one has a slightly higher product capability. The ones in the south tend to have some automotive capability. Whereas the one in the Midwest will be more building product targeted. Theresa Wagler : I think has a little to do with the infrastructure that's possibly required as well. Carlos de Alba : All right, thank you very much. Good luck in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Timna Tanners : Hey, guys, good morning. Wanted to ask just really about production to follow up, so two things. One is your first quarter production, flat rolled products were down year-over-year and I thought I heard you say that it was a result of Roanoke and West Virginia which are long product. So I was kind of confused. I would assume and I think the big question for a lot of people in the industry is why are the mills not running full out given record prices? And yet you guys were down year-over-year and down from third quarter in flat roll. So just wondering what to think about that and how to model volumes going forward? Theresa Wagler : Well, first of all, I'll just jump in. I thought Andreas was talking about shipments not production. So if I got that wrong that was my fault. Mark, you want to talk about the production side of things. We suffice it to say, Timna that we are running as hard as we can at both Butler and at Columbus. We aren't without some of our hiccups along the way as well. But we've rectified those and yeah. Mark Millett : I think there's also an impact a little bit on the product mix and also on shipments from a standpoint of transportation. Logistics is a little tough right now. And we have greater opportunity for shipments than we actually ended up. Timna Tanners : Okay, so upside from Q1 it sounds like. Thank you for that. And then Sinton, I was looking through my notes and I have a couple years ago, so maybe it's dated, but if you had said pretty clearly and talked about being able to ramp up quickly. So we had modeled a little more aggressive ramp up to be honest on Sinton, I have in my notes that you said within six months, you'd be at 80% of that. So I'm just wondering is there any reason for kind of the push out in timing and also just in the 2022 forecast you touted in the past inability to ramp up quickly and talked about your track record doing so. But so I was surprised that to 2.2 out of 3 million tons next year, thanks. Mark Millett : Well, 2.2 million, 2.4 million tons is 80% of 3 million tons capability, Timna. And I think the team hitting that will be a remarkable feat. Timna Tanners : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Thanks. Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Phil Gibbs : And Mark, can you talk a little bit about automotive? I mean, there's a lot swirling given the chip shortages and the downtime at the - at some of the domestic and after producers. Even globally, you said your shipments remain strong. Obviously, the demand side of equation is very strong to your point. So I'm just trying to understand how this ultimately all plays out. Do you think the OEs despite all this were short on inventory, that's why they continue to take volume, maybe just help us think through this? Mark Millett : I think the sort of end demand for vehicles today is incredibly strong. And the few dealers that I talked to are struggling to get inventory and feel that it's - that that strength is going to remain for some time. I think they were generally projecting somewhere between 17 million and 18 million units for the year. And the best prognostications are that the chip shortage may impact that by a million and a half. I'm not sure. All I can say is through our lens, and it's quite fortuitous, I guess. But the plants that are down are not ones that we supply. So we have not seen any material impact from a shipping standpoint. We have seen a slight impact on the scrap side. So I think you're going to see - whereas we anticipated that softening a little bit in the last month - for this month. I think prime scrap is probably going to be firm, maybe up a little. But then again, it's too early to tell the buy is still a couple of weeks ahead. But no major impact for us so far. Phil Gibbs : Thanks Mark. And then on the engineered bar side you had a nice pickup in volume, very strong sequentially and up nicely year-on-year. Yeah, how much of that do you think is driven by automotive? I can't remember how much of your mix there is in that silo and yeah, how much is that - you think is related to the yellow good commentary you made? Mark Millett : Well, I think there's a general impact across the space. We've seen a little greater activity sort of seams pipe for the for the energy markets, yellow goods is stronger, manufacturing is strong. But I would say the principal growth and target for that growth there has been automotive. I think we're around about 20% of the mix there right now. And if you remember some years ago, we installed a smaller diameter mill and that utilization is picking up quite dramatically. Phil Gibbs : Thanks Mark. And if I could squeeze in one more here, lumber prices have been obviously astronomically high the last six to nine months. Steel prices have followed the trend, obviously. How much in some cases are you seeing substitution into steel, particularly as it relates to your fabrication book? And maybe some other things as competing products become more expensive as well? Thanks very much. Mark Millett : Well, we've not seen any - at least I don't - I'm not aware of seeing any substitution threat right now. Obviously, all materials have come up together. But then again steel products are quite unique to replace - in the steel warehouse space where they want large spans, you obviously can't do that with lumber. You may see lumber substitution in high rise buildings in the past, but not in the growth area of distribution warehouses and that sort of thing. Phil Gibbs : Thanks Mark. Operator : Back concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Miller for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, super. For those that remain on the call, we certainly appreciate your time today and you're support of our company. For our employees, again, hats off to you, it was an absolutely phenomenal quarter and ask you to look after each other out there and be safe. And again, we wouldn't be able to have a phenomenal quarter without our customer base. We got some loyal phenomenal people that we worked with, that we partnered with over the years. So thank you, each and every one of you. With that said, make it a great day and be safe. Operator : Once again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. Have a great and safe day.",

And now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter '21 earnings call. We appreciate your time and thank you for joining us today. The entire Steel Dynamics team delivered yet another phenomenal performance filled [ph] with operating and financial records, including record sales, operating income, cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA, a tremendous performance driven by the dedication and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that will continue to drive higher through cycle earnings. The team is delivering exceptional results and I'm very proud to be among them. Due to the continued commitment of our teams to one another, our families, and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID. The health and welfare of our teams is paramount and I thank each of them for their continued commitment to safety. Record financial results are a little important unless everyone goes home safely at the end of each day. The number of injuries and associated severity improved in the first half of '21 compared to last year. The teams have focused on reducing hazards and practices that could result in significant injury. Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our people, it is our number one value. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our intent will always be to have zero incidents. To achieve this, we must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our fellow team members, keeping safety top of mind in order to take control of safety. Our commitment to all aspects of sustainability is embedded in our founding principles woven into the fabric of our Company, valuing the health and safety of our teams, partnering with our customers, supporting our communities, and minimizing our environmental footprint. An extension of this commitment is evidenced in our recent announcement concerning goals for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and renewable energy milestones, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon-neutral by 2050. We've been a leader in the area of sustainability for more than 25 years and we plan to stay right in that position. We are starting from a place of strength with already industry-low Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, yet, we plan to do more. As we progress on this strategic path, we will plan to share our outcomes with you. But now, Theresa will share insights into our recent performance. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to our entire Steel Dynamics team. As Mark said, we achieved numerous milestones, attained record second quarter performance with record revenues of $4.5 billion derived from record quarterly steel shipments, record fabrication shipments, and strong product pricing across all of our operating platforms. We achieved record quarterly operating income of $956 million and net income of $702 million, or $3.32 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $587 million, with record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion, a truly extraordinary performance. Our second quarter 2021 results included costs of approximately $23 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, associated with the construction of our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $719 million, or $3.40 per diluted share. Our second quarter revenues of $4.5 billion were 26% higher than sequential first quarter results with growth from all of our operating platforms, but most significantly from our steel operations based on record shipments and continued strong flat rolled steel selling values. Our second quarter 2021 operating income was $956 million, 61% higher than the first quarter results also driven by strong flat rolled steel pricing and robust demand more than offsetting increased scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for 2021 and 2022, and we're confident in our forthcoming unique earnings catalysts. Our steel operations generated over $1 billion of operating income in the second quarter, 59% greater than first quarter sequential earnings as flat roll steel selling values continued to strengthen. We also saw expanded margins throughout our long product steel operations due to improved pricing and volume. We achieved record quarterly steel shipments of 2.9 million tons and our steel mills operated at 91% of their capability. We still have additional steel-market opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capability of over 13 million tons and when our new Texas steel mill is fully online, we will have over 6 million tons of availability. Operating income from our metals recycling operations with $51 million aligned with strong first quarter performance as domestic steel production improved further supporting ferrous scrap demand and pricing. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher-quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency, and by reducing Company-wide working capital requirements. Our fabrication operations once again achieved record shipments and expanded margins in the quarter as realized selling values more than offset continued higher steel input costs. Operating income was $28 million versus first quarter earnings of $10 million. Steel joists and deck demand remains very strong, as evidenced by our record customer order backlog and continued robust order activity. We expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase through the remainder of the year. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable-cost structure. At the end of the second quarter, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion comprised of cash of $1.1 billion, and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the second quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $587 million and $849 million during the first six months of the year, also a record. Working capital grew over $700 million in the first half of 2021 due to higher prices resulting in increased customer count and inventory values. During the first half of 2021, we've invested $587 million in capital investments, of which $489 million was invested in our new Texas flat roll steel mill. For the second half of 2021, we estimate capital investments will be roughly between $350 million and $400 million, of which, the Texas steel mill represents an estimated $300 million. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.26 per common share after increasing it 4% in the first quarter of this year. We also repurchased $393 million of our common stock representing 3% of outstanding shares. In July, we announced the Board's approval of an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics' future cash flow generation. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend per share over 85% and we've repurchased over $1.6 billion of common stock representing 19% of our outstanding shares, while during the same timeframe we achieved an investment grade credit rating and maintained our growth Company profile by investing $2.8 billion in organic capital investments and funding $720 million in acquisitions. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base-positive dividend that's complemented with a variable share-repurchase program. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy and we are dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity and have been since our founding. Further committing to this path, we recently announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon-neutral by 2050. To increase transparency, we have set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. As Mark said, we've led the steel industry with our exclusive use of EAF technology, circular manufacturing model, and innovative solutions to increase efficiencies, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials, and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our sustainability goals through among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy, and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for the traditional blast furnace industry. Our sustainability and environmental impact strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role in developing innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. Additionally, for those that track our individual flat roll steel shipments, in the second quarter, our hot roll and our P&O sales -- or shipments, excuse me, were 719,000 tons. Our cold-rolled shipments were 150,000 tons and our coated shipments were 1,055,000 tons. With that, Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thanks, Theresa. I would just add a little more color to each operating platform. The steel-fabrication platform delivered a strong performance again, achieving record quarterly shipments and almost tripling sequential operating income. Based on the strength of steel joists and decking demand, increased product pricing is more than offsetting the continued rise in steel input costs. Order activity continues to be extremely strong. We again ended the quarter with a record fabrication order backlog at levels considerably higher than historical peaks. The non-residential construction market is strong, especially in areas that support online, retail, computing activities, and pharmaceuticals, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities. We believe this dynamic will continue for the next several years as we see long-lasting changes in consumer behavior. As we mentioned last quarter, we've hired additional people and expanding operating hours at our several steel and fabrication locations in order to meet increased customer demand. These changes should increase annual production capability by well over 100,000 tons. Our metals recycling operations had an extremely strong quarter with quarterly operating income of $51 million. Strong ferrous demand and increased pricing related to higher domestic steel production drove strong performance. Prime scrap index pricing average increased $60 to $70 per gross ton during the quarter. Prime scrap generation has been solid based on strong North American manufacturing. We expect US scrap generation and alternative iron unit production to keep pace with the increased demand from steel-making in the coming years. Additionally, we believe China's scrap reservoir will grow considerably over the next three to five years, offsetting their expanding EAF capability, while providing additional global raw material supply. We believe metallics pricing in general has peaked and scrap will remain flat in the coming quarter. The steel team had an outstanding quarter, continuing to achieve numerous operating and financial records, including record shipments of 2.9 million tons and record operating income of over $1 billion. While the domestic steel industry operated at the utilization rate of 81%, our steel mills operated at 91% during the second quarter, slightly lower than our first quarter rate of 93%. In June, we experienced the burn-through in one of our furnaces at our Columbus flat-roll steel mill. Importantly, no one on the team was injured. The resulting outage though lasted about 10 days impacting second quarter production and shipments by about 60,000 tons and 30,000 tons, respectively. Columbus is now again fully operational. Steel demand is strong across our entire steel platform. Our long product steel operations achieved increased shipments at all of their locations with the structural and rail division achieving record quarterly volume. The flat-roll steel markets remain especially tight. Strong demand, coupled with extremely low customer inventory levels across the supply chain continue to support flat-roll steel prices above historical peaks. Customers are placing orders for immediate demand requirements and have not had the ability to rebuild inventory. Additionally, the speculative risk associated with the accumulation of higher-priced inventory is also a significant deterrent to procuring imports. We believe current legislated steel trade policies, such as the Section 201 cases imposed in 2015, 2016, and subsequent anti-circumvention restrictions, will continue to keep steel imports at moderated levels. The current US administration has also commented constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues created by China's steel making overcapacity. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the US and the EU on revoking 232 tariffs, we expect the final agreement will include import surge protections to protect US national security goals. Aside from Turkey, Europe has never been a significant import source and we have long thought collaborating with them against China and other Asian export-based economies that are the greatest contributors to global overcapacity is the most effective path to fair trade. From an end-market perspective, the automotive sector is operating at solid production levels due to low inventories coupled with strong consumer demand. Current build rate forecasts for '22 and '23 are at 17 million units, representing a very strong outlook. Auto inventories are 55% below the five-year average and at the lowest supply level in over 35 years. And additionally, at this point, we've been fortunate that our automotive order book has not seen any significant impact from the ongoing electronic chip shortage. The non-residential construction sector remains strong, as evidenced by our record structural and tail division shipments, record steel fabrication shipments, and strong long-product steel order backlogs. We expect this strength to continue through the rest of this year and into next. Residential construction has also been strong resulting in high demand for HVAC, appliances, and other related products. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining and yellow goods customers at our engineered bar products division. And more recently, we're finally seeing some indications of an improved energy sector as global energy prices have improved. We've executed numerous strategic investments across the Company in the last several years and we continue to position Steel Dynamics for the future. We and our customers continue to be extremely excited about our Sinton, Texas electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill investment. It represents transformational, competitively advantaged strategic growth with associated long-term value creation for all of our stakeholders. It provides lower carbon-emitting, next-generation EAF steel production capabilities, new products, and new customers. The 3 million ton state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of existing electric arc furnace flat roll steel producers, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high-carbon foreign competition. It provides us with broader steel portfolio while providing our customers with an even larger climate-conscious supply option. The electric arc furnace production route is by far the most sustainable, environmentally-friendly supply chain, and the lowest carbon footprint. We are currently hot commissioning the 250,000-ton paint line and we expect the 550,000-ton galvanizing line with Galvalume coating capability to be operational next month. The entire Sinton team is doing a tremendous job, but due to excessive heavy rains experienced in Texas over the last several months, actual steel production at Sinton is not likely to begin until mid-fourth quarter of this year. Theresa shared our views concerning shipments and through cycle earnings capability of this new steel mill. It's is truly a transformational project and we are just at the edge of seeing the tremendous benefits it will bring to us, our teams, our customers, and our stakeholders. The Town of Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi with regional commercial markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the US and Mexico as customers are excited to have freight advantaged regional flat roll steel supplier. We currently have five customers committed to locate on-site representing over 1.5 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability. Based on our location with much shorter lead times, we can provide a superior customer supply chain solution. It also allows us to effectively compete with imports coming into Houston and the West Coast, which inherently have long lead times and speculative price risk. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican scrap company last August, a critical step. The operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. They have an estimated annual scrap processing capability of almost 2 million gross tons, and we also acquired three smaller scrap locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area, which we did the last quarter. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with our considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel mills positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. We're not simply adding flat roll steel production capacity, we have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight, and lead time advantage, and offer an import alternative to a region in need of options. We also recently announced plans to add four additional value-add flat roll coating lines comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our preferred supply chain has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at full capacity through both increased consumption and market share gain. Two of the new lines will be in the Southern US region to support Sinton. The other two lines will be in the Midwest and will also be comprised of a new paint line and galvanizing line with a combined annual capacity of 540,000 tons. These lines will support our regional flat roll steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customer needs. We currently believe these lines will begin operations in the second half of 2022. Our strategy consistently places value-added products and supply chain differentiation on the fore and has benefit us well. In closing, our business model and execution of our long-term strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. Additionally, our customer focus coupled with market diversification and low-cost operating platforms, support our ability to maintain our best-in-class financial performance. Our amazing teams and the spirit of excellence are the foundation of that success. I thank each of them for their passion and dedication to one another and remember that your health and safety are always the most important issue at hand. So, thanks to all for you being on the call today. I appreciate your listening and now, Daryl, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Mark and Theresa, and thanks for the update here. My first question is around the four value-add coating lines. I thought last quarter that the expected CapEx for these value-add lines ranged between $400 million and $425 million, but I think you've outlined a budget of $450 million to $500 million today. So would be curious as to what has changed around the scope of the project or the timeline that has may be driven this increase here? Mark Millett : I think two things as we delved into it, we got a clearer picture, firstly, of the cost structure, but I think more importantly, it's just the expansion of line capability that added a little bit more. Theresa Wagler : It also is being priced on current steel values and so that appreciates the total project cost as well. Emily Chieng : That's clear. And maybe just to further this sort of line of questioning around growth, it sounds like you've got a pretty constructive view of the US steel industry, clearly providing some further opportunities for growth in the coming years. What else do you think there could be planned for Steel Dynamics longer-term beyond these four coating lines as it relates to growth within your capital allocation budget? Should it be further organic growth in the downstream, additional capacity, how should we think about how you could be allocating capital here? Mark Millett : Sure. I think you will see going forward a continued plan to invest downstream and value-added downstream processing. That has been a key part of our strategy to date and will continue to do so. And as one looks across our operating platform on the steel side, we see continued organic growth capability there. I do believe also we have an incredibly strong balance sheet, strong liquidity, our cash flow generation capability continues to improve through cycle and there will be, I think, a good balanced cash allocation strategy. Transactional growth will certainly be part of that. There appears to be a strong pipeline of opportunity in both pull-through manufacturing type operations on the market today along with steel assets. Emily Chieng : Great. That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Carlos de Alba : Thank you very much, everyone. Mark, perhaps for you, you mentioned that you expect metallics prices to have peaked already. Any views on the steel prices given what you said about metallics? Mark Millett : No, I think, Carlos, we remain incredibly bullish of the market for the rest of this year and into next year. On the demand side, it's just incredibly strong. You have a tight supply side right now. Inventories are at record low levels, I think MSCI data is 1.8 months, incredibly, incredibly low and there is no restocking capability there currently because there's just lack of availability to meet present demand. Mill lead times are stretched. You have -- imports have ticked up a little, but they're still moderated, and in all honestly, despite the large arbitrage availability, near-term availability for imports is still very, very, tight. So I don't see there being any ability for a surge there to take things over the top. And if you look at the second half of this year, there are a myriad of mill outages, both for just regular maintenance outages, but also for installation of new equipment [indiscernible] and those mills as they plan on their future expansion. So there's going to be a lot of steel actually coming offline in the second half, which is going to just tighten the supply/demand balance even more. So, I think for the rest of this year, it's a bullish market for us. Carlos de Alba : All right. Thanks for that. So, basically, you expect increasing margins perhaps as scrap prices go down and the steel prices remain high. What are the implications maybe there for working capital given that it was -- the cash generation was very solid, but working capital obviously -- for obvious reasons, the consumer -- cash during the first half. Do you continue to see that basically at the same level in terms of days of working capital, maybe accounts receivables and inventories in terms of days of sales and cost at similar levels than what we experienced in the second quarter? Theresa Wagler : I think we should see that moderating because from the perspective of pricing, Mark's correct, we've had very strong steel pricing and volumes have increased, but now that we're at this level, I don't see there being significant draws for the second half of the year, although, we will be increasing working capital as Sinton ramps up. So Sinton could be as much as $150 million to $200 million of working capital in the next, call it, six to nine months. But I don't think that you're going to see as significant of a draw in working capital in the second half of the year as we experienced in the first half of the year. Carlos de Alba : All right. Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sathish Kasinathan with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Sathish Kasinathan : Yes, hi. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on the steel fabrication segment. The second quarter '21 shipments were at record levels, but if you look at on a quarter-on-quarter basis, the shipments were only up 3% despite the record backlogs and your guidance in April on adding more crews. So just wanted to get a sense of what was there, any weather-related impact in 2Q and how should we look at the shipment progression for the rest of the year? Mark Millett : Well, as you point out, it did increase albeit incrementally quarter-over-quarter, but the additional folks that we've brought on board, obviously, they've been ramping up and they need to be trained, and you won't see or wouldn't have seen a massive increase second quarter, but you will see that ramping up third and fourth quarter. Sathish Kasinathan : Okay. Thank you for that. And you mentioned about planned outages at some of your peers. I just wanted to get a sense of if you have any outages planned within your system for the second half of 2021? Mark Millett : Both, I believe Columbus and Butler will take their normal kind of full-day outages in the third, fourth quarter. Sathish Kasinathan : Third and fourth quarter, okay. Thank you for that and good luck for the next quarter. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Gagliano : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the capital allocation side of it, first of all, historically, the mix over the last five years has been kind of 65, 35 between growth versus shareholder returns. Should we expect that mix to change meaningfully in the out years? And a related question, I noticed long product utilization rates are now creeping up close to 90%, which is pretty amazing, and I'm just wondering if you can speak to, as you think about capital allocation plans, are you interested in expanding in your long-products capacity given the utilization rates at this point and the positive outlook? And if so, would that more likely be organic or inorganic opportunities? That's my first question. Thanks. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, Dave. From a shareholder distributions and capital allocation, so first and foremost, we definitely are a growth-oriented Company, and we intend to stay that way. But we believe, it's important during these periods of excess cash flow generation to provide increased distributions to shareholders. And as we've said in the past, we like to keep our dividend in a very manageable level. When Sinton is up and operational, you will see a significant increase in the dividend at that point, because we're going to have significantly higher through cycle cash flow. But until that time, and as we're generating excess cash, we will be utilizing the share buyback program as well. We think that's an important tool. However, we are very much focused on growth. As Mark mentioned, there are transaction opportunities today. There is quite an extensive pipeline, the teams are very busy, again, focused on manufacturing businesses, as well as potentially steel production assets as well. You're correct, the long-products utilization has improved nicely and we're seeing a lot of both good demand, and then also the commercial teams have been doing a good job of cross-selling those products and we've gotten some market share gains out of that as well. Mark, would you like to address the question, whether or not we want to grow in long products? Mark Millett : Yes. But just to touch on, David, you're right, the long-products markets have got incredibly hot here off late. Certainly, you're seeing that in the margin expansion. There has been a change there, whereby pricing tended to be adjusted in lockstep with any change in scrap, but as you've seen over the last few months, it's become a market-based, demand-based pricing scenario and margins have increased 150%, sometimes 200% on some products. So it is a very, very strong market for us today for sure across the space, merchants, beams, rail is stellar and engineered bar and honestly, I think we're pretty well closed there from an order book perspective for the rest of the year and going into next year; so a great market. That said, if you look at the kind of capacity in merchant shapes and beams in particular relative to through cycle consumption, that's one area, that is -- it's a kind of an overcapacity situation through the cycle. And therefore, I wouldn't envision us having any meaningful increase in hot side production of shapes. I think you will see us utilize excess hot metal capability that we've got in a couple of our mills on the long-product side, but again, it won't be a massive increase in capacity. David Gagliano : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just my second or -- yes, my second question on -- switching gears a little bit, on the cost side. If we kind of try to back into conversion cost and obviously, there's different moving parts there, but it does look like they've crept fairly meaningfully higher. I was wondering if you just speak to the cost creep there, was that mix driven, or are there underlying cost pressures? And how should we be modeling conversion costs relative to what we just saw this quarter on a forward-looking basis? Thanks. Theresa Wagler : So David, I know how you try to back into conversion costs and in the world where now we have a lot more processing versus just steel production, it's going to be harder and harder for you back into that number that way. So we had a considerable amount of more substrate coming into the system and having it coated versus directly from the steel production itself. And so where in as that makes it look like there is an increased conversion cost, there's actually not. It's just that we are processing more outside tons because there's such strong demand. And we can maybe try to unpack that a little bit better from quarter to quarter, but there were no significant increases in conversion costs. David Gagliano : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gordon Johnson with GLJ Research. Please proceed with your questions. Gordon Johnson : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get your thoughts on comments made by the President yesterday that the economy is booming. And looking at some of the survey data that came out of Michigan last week with respect to home buying trends and car buying trends, home buying trends being the worst based on the survey since the '90s, same for cars. Clearly, things are great right now, but do you guys see any potential for some pullback in the second half? And then I have a follow-up. Mark Millett : Well, the simple answer to that is, no. The demand is incredibly strong across all our sectors. We can't make enough steel. There's massive pent-up demand, particularly on the automotive side. And as I said earlier, if you look at inventories right now, they're at very, very, very low levels on a historic basis and there is a pent-up demand. And if you talk to the large dealers out there, they just cannot get enough product and they would suggest there's going to be a couple of years before they actually catch up. So, we remain incredibly bullish for the rest of this year and going into next year. There is absolutely no doubt about it. There's a lot -- there seems to be this cloud over people's minds or heads, but we are in the trenches, we're talking to customers each and every day. I'm talking to customers each and every day. I think we have a good finger on the pulse and it's got legs, there's no doubt about it. Gordon Johnson : Okay, that's helpful. And then, on the flip side, there's been fears around and this is in my turn, but I think we all know it well, Steelmageddon and a lot of the incremental capacity that a lot of people expect to come online, but based on our estimates, a lot of that capacity is either redundant or has been pushed out. Do you guys share that view? And on the positive side, do you see the potential for maintenance, Cliffs has taken a mill down here pretty soon, it's going be down for a while. There are some other mills coming down. Do you guys not see the potential for prices to move even higher from here? Thank you for the questions. Mark Millett : Well, we've had a -- as many of you on the call know, I've had a very long-standing contrasting view to the overcapacity issue or situation. And what people have not been able to figure out or understand is that the US is one of the few if not the only countries that is steel short. Additional capacity is not our problem. In fact, our industry is doing the right thing. It needs to reinvest, it needs to get state-of-the-art equipment on board, both from a global competitive perspective because if you look at China, 85% of Chinese capacity today is less than 15 years old, it's modern. So our industry needs to invest and it needs to continue to invest in electric arc furnace-type production routes from a sustainability standpoint. So, in my humble opinion, when you have an industry that arguably has somewhere 95 million tons to 100 million tons of production capability, and a need in a normal market of at least 120 million tons, production capability is not the issue, imports are the issue and controlling them. And I think as I said earlier, we do believe the tools are in place. Section 201 will maintain a sort of barrier, even if the 232 tariffs get eroded. So I am not concerned about overcapacity one little bit. Some of the older antiquated high-cost integrated capabilities will remain offline and I think will offset the somewhat 6 million tons or so of new flat roll coming into our marketplace. Gordon Johnson : Thanks, again for the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Phil Gibbs : Hey. Good morning. Congrats on all the progress. Mark Millett : Thanks, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Mark, I just have first question just on the demand side with automotive and oil and gas. I know auto has been a strong, kind of the first to lead us out of the whole last year, but recently, IHS has kind of taking down their forecast on demand and the semi-chip issues. Wondering just what you're seeing there in terms of pull from your customers? And then, secondarily, you did mention oil and gas getting better at the margin. Maybe just expand upon what you're seeing there and if your customers are trying to prepare you for a strong bounce back in '22? Mark Millett : So again, Phil, from our intelligence, people are looking at a 17 million ton build rate this year and next year -- next year, sorry. That's an incredibly strong number. And I think as I suggested, when we talk to the dealers out there, when we look at the inventories, that is going to be -- the demand or the -- it's a pent-up demand there that's going to sustain things. The chip shortage for some maybe sort of hindering shipping capability. As I said earlier, very few of our auto platforms have been affected to date. So we've been fortunate, but if you think about it, okay, so chip shortages slow things down a little bit, the demand is still pent up, is still there, and it's just going to help expand this incredible cycle that we're on or in. Phil Gibbs : And then, on the oil and gas side, Mark? Mark Millett : Yes. Theresa whispered that across, sorry. Phil Gibbs : No worries, not in hurry. Mark Millett : On the energy side, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Obviously, global pricing, energy prices have come up a little, rig counts are coming up a little. We're seeing improved kind of downhole OCTG requirements, so engineered bar, for instance, we supply rolled bar into the seamless tube market, that has been picking up, a little slower though on the kind of the infrastructure. The distribution pipeline is still very, very soft and the cancellation of a couple of pipelines here over the last few months have left inventory in the supply chain that's trying to get sort of reallocated across the country. So, OCTG, downhole strengthening, infrastructure, distribution line pipe is going to be a little soft for probably at least another 12 months. Phil Gibbs : Okay, I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up here on the CapEx side. I think Theresa you said CapEx of $350 million to $400 million in the second half. Was there something pushed out into next year because I thought last time you had talked about making some pre-stage investments for your tandem lines? Theresa Wagler : Yes. Based on engineering and some of the more detailed plans that we've received on the four lines, some of that's likely to be pushed from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. So next year without doing our detailed planning, you're likely to see capital expenditures of probably somewhere between $550 million and $600 million. Phil Gibbs : Terrific. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Tristan Gresser with Exane BNP. Please proceed with your questions. Tristan Gresser : Yes. Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Regarding the new environmental targets, is there any CapEx associated to those targets, and what's the timeline, if you have already identified new initiatives to cut emissions by 2025 and 2030? And if you can, what is roughly the contribution from each focus area? I mean, I think you talk about new technology, efficiency, but also renewable, if you have that split that would be helpful as well. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Good morning. Thanks for the question. That was a very detailed question, I'm not sure I might be able to go into all of it at this point in time. We do have some things that we can't discuss yet. They're very exciting on the renewable energy side of the equation. There will be some capital dollars, obviously, spent as we look at efficiency projects and as we move toward more renewable energy and the carbon reduction itself. We really don't have estimates to be able to discuss this morning because there's still a lot of projects that are being vetted. We will be disclosing those items as we move forward but we have a very -- and this is the thing that we want everybody to understand how we're trying to differentiate ourselves in our carbon goals and in our renewable energy goals, is that, we are being very transparent. There is a clear path on how we're going to achieve 2025 and 2030, and as we're able to disclose some of these projects, we absolutely, Tristan, will be sharing these projects, but at this point in time it's just too early to do so. Tristan Gresser : All right, no problem. And maybe a follow-up on raw material. Can you talk a bit about how your raw material strategy will evolve in both the context of capacity expansion, but also decarbonization as it has an impact on, for instance, Scope 3? How do you think your raw material mix will evolve in coming years? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Well, the raw material strategy really is consistent from the perspective at least of what we're looking at today and that's we use really only about 20% to 25% pig iron in our flat roll mills, and so it's not as much as being advertised by maybe some of our peers today and that is being sourced obviously internationally. So, today, we use a mix of HPI as well and we'll continue to do that moving forward, but I don't see this strategy at this point in time or at least over the next near term changing dramatically. Mark? Mark Millett : No, I think, again, we're executing on our plan that we've had in place for some time. Fortunately, we have a very, very good foundation through our omni-source recycling platform that has the capability of some 6 million tons, 7 million tons of capability. So supply of scrap is not going to be an issue for us for sure. And we're adding to that capability, as I said, in Mexico and some of those tons will flow up to Sinton and to our Columbus mill. So, I think we're in good shape on the scrap side of things. As Theresa suggested, we are using HPI and have been using a little bit more of that of late. We have IDI that people seem to forget. That's a very, very effective use for our Butler mill in particular, it's making about 260,000 tons of liquid iron that we put into our electric arc furnace each year. And just to emphasize, if you look across our steel platform, in total, pig iron is only -- I think, it's less than 8% of the total input. So yes, it's an impact, but not a massive one. Tristan Gresser : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Tumazos with Very Independent Research. Please proceed with your question. John Tumazos : Congratulations on $0.7 billion in a quarter. Looking at your CapEx strategy for the next two years, it looks like the focus is to maximize Sinton, complete the painting lines, the Galvalume galvanizing, get all the squeal out of the pig. Is it fair for us to expect your next big capital expenditure initiatives to be 2024, 2025 completion, maybe the outlays begin a little sooner, but where you are focused right now is making hay while the sun shines and getting everything out of the 3 million ton new mill? Mark Millett : Thank you, John. It's good to hear from you. There is absolutely no doubt that the team's focus has been the execution of Sinton and it's a very large-scale facility. Actually, if you jump on our website, we have a drone video that gets updated I think once a month and it's a colossal, phenomenal facility that's being built by the team down there. And so, the focus for sure has been execution, execution, execution. Nonetheless, we have other folks on our team that continue to look at transactional activity, and also, the individual mills, we have very talented teams that continue to look at areas of organic growth. So I think you'll certainly see just a continuation of that organic growth that you've seen in the last 25 years or so. From a Sinton standpoint, the new lines that you mentioned that parallels or just supports our long-term strategy of fully utilizing or building high levels of through cycle utilization. And so not only are those four new lines very effective uses of CapEx with very, very, very good returns, it allows those capital intense steel mill assets to run at a high utilization, as I said, through the cycle. And I think we've demonstrated clearly that that strategy allows us to have superior shipments, production capabilities in any market environment. John Tumazos : So, there could be a big project before '24, '25, or a transaction? Mark Millett : We would imagine -- I think I've said it in the past, we don't see a Sintonasc greenfield project on our horizon. Transactional activity, there could be something meaningful there. John Tumazos : Thank you very much and congratulations $3 billion annual rates, amazing for profits. Mark Millett : Thank you, John. We've got a great team. A little bit of a market tailwind is not hurting either, but\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Glick : Thanks for sneaking me in. You mentioned talking to customers and auto customers in particular but inventories across or beyond auto are also pretty low. Any sense as to what the game plan is for your non-auto customers in terms of rebuilding those inventories once they have access to more supply? Mark Millett : Well, I don't think there's really any desire right now to rebuild. Firstly, people just can't get enough steel to satisfy their immediate needs, number one, domestically. And number two, the speculative risk associated with accumulating inventory in today's market environment is a -- it'd be a pretty gutsy call. Imports, as I said, despite the high arbitrage, there is very little available currently. The global markets are very, very strong and most of the material is being consumed within those markets. So there is not much available even if they wanted to. That said, the speculative risk of material flowing in and import delivery times are November, December, January, today. You don't want to take that risk. So, I don't see any rebuild in the near term and again, that's just another factor that's going to extend this cycle. Michael Glick : Understood. And then, I think you noted $475 million to $500 million of incremental through cycle EBITDA once the value-add lines are complete. Could you walk us through some of these spread assumptions there so we can understand the moving parts a bit better? Theresa Wagler : Michael, we won't go through the details spreads themselves. We will tell you that the spreads are based on mid-cycle spreads, so definitely not what we're experiencing today. And we're starting with a base hot roll to prime scrap kind of mix spread and then we build the value-added product mix off of that. And we are using what we've experienced historically, and then also looking forward at what the expectations are in those individual markets on a mid-cycle basis. So I'm sorry, we can't give you specific spreads, but it is showing that certain -- our expectations are that the volume operates very much like our Columbus and Butler facilities operate, that means that production and shipments tend to be at or near capacity on a mid-cycle basis. Michael Glick : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sean Wondrack with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Sean Wondrack : Hi, Mark and Theresa, and congratulations on another great quarter here. Just a couple of housekeeping items and I apologize if you've mentioned these, but taxes, I recognize you had a shield related to Sinton. I think it's supposed to continue to work in your favor. Can you maybe touch on that and sort of expectations for working capital for the year, please? Theresa Wagler : Yes, absolutely. So, yes Sinton will -- still expected to provide a tax shield this year as we're able to -- of the year of operations, be able to expense that successive investment. It likely will shield upwards of $350 plus million. However, our earnings are so strong, that we're still having tax payments that are required, this year. And I think we're estimating our effective tax rate to be about 15%. From the perspective of working capital, Sinton is likely to build working capital as it starts operations in the next six to nine months of somewhere between $150 million and $200 million. Outside of that, I would expect the rest of our operations working capital to remain fairly steady just given that our volumes have already picked up and pricing has been really strong as well. So, I don't see a lot of additional movement in working capital. Sean Wondrack : Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of opportunistic use of cash flow, you have $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. You're going to continue to generate cash going forward. You've, obviously, done a nice job outlining the various ways you can use that cash, but I guess my question is, do you think it's prudent to keep a solid cash balance there should an opportunity arise, or should the market turn at some point just so that you have the ability to go out and make these transactions? Theresa Wagler : It's a good question. Our balance sheet is extraordinarily strong. So even if you look at our net leverage or our gross leverage, either metric is solidly in the investment-grade arena. We have significant additional debt capacity and the capital structure, and so where in as, yes, it makes sense to keep some cash on the balance sheet, we also have things that we can spend that money on whether it's additional share repurchases as we expect to make in the second half of the year and it still won't hinder all of the growth expectations or projects that we think are available to us on the transaction side. So yes, we do keep dry powder at the same token, and there's still debt capacity as well. Mark Millett : And I would just add, if you look -- hopefully, when you look at our experience of growth over the years, it's always been very, very intentional I would say. I would say, it's also very disciplined, and we won't do a transaction at ludicrous numbers. We always look at through-cycle. So if we were to do a transaction today, it will be a good investment through the cycle not just based on today's crazy profitability that some may have. Sean Wondrack : Right. No, that makes sense. I feel like you've demonstrated that over time as you've scaled this business up, it's not always easy to do that. I guess just my last question, just touching on something you said earlier, Mark. When you think about the US market sort of being in a deficit -- deficit for years, I guess philosophically do you believe that eventually domestic producers will evolve to fill that demand gap, or do you think we will always have a component of imports coming into this country? Mark Millett : I think there will always be some element of imports for sure. It has been a long, long, long time. I think I don't know, mid-'70s or '80s or whenever, when imports were de minimis. We're not going to be a country that self-satisfies its demand in total. So imports are always going to be there. Today, we typically need -- 20% of demand is an import need. We just don't need 30 million tons or 30% imports. But I think if you -- all the discussion has been relatively near term, when I say near term six, nine months into next year. But people are not, I don't believe anyway, recognizing that the industry is in transition. And I think there is some paradigm shifts occurring that are going to retain a lot higher sort of health -- market health in our industry and a much higher margins going forward. You look at the leadership mindset today and the consolidation, the integrated industry is really focused on returning shareholder value. They are totally focused on consolidating and rationalizing their assets to make good business sense. And that's going to bring I think market health and market strength long term. USMCA has, I think, certainly for us been a market change in dynamic, where you see particularly the European automakers, a shift in their supply chain from imports to domestic sourcing. Again, we've been a very, very large beneficiary of that. So the market is changing for sure in this country, and as I said earlier, it needs more capacity, it needs state-of-the-art technological capability, low cost, sustainable low carbon footprint production routes. And so I am not fearful for a second about the capacity coming online, it's needed and it will benefit the North American manufacturer base in spades going forward. Sean Wondrack : I appreciate that. It's a very thoughtful answer to a pretty difficult question, but thank you very much and good luck going forward. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you, Daryl. I would just emphasize, well, firstly, thank you for those that are still on the call. Thank you for listening today to our thoughts and opinions anyway. It was an incredible quarter. We believe next quarter is going to be better even so. And that is driven certainly by the market tailwinds that we're experiencing, but it's also more importantly driven by the most phenomenal steel metals team in the world. They are an incredible bunch of individuals. We number 10,000 there. If you include their wives and partners and kids, we've got, I don't know, 25,000 people in the SDI family today. They all contribute to our success. So thank you to each and every one of them. Thank you to our customers. We can't do what we do without you. We've had some incredibly loyal support and I wish we could support them even more today because they are -- we are struggling to meet all their needs. So, thank you, everyone. Make it a great day, and be safe. Take care. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

Aided by the market tailwind, it was a tremendous accomplishment, driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to drive higher through cycle earnings. The team is truly delivering exceptional results and I'm proud to be among them. Due to the steadfast commitment of our teams to one another, our families and our customers, we continue to operate safely amidst COVID. The health and welfare of our teams is paramount, and I thank each of them for being their brothers and sisters\u2019 keeper. Record financial results are no important if our teams do not remain safe. Our safety performance continues to be significantly better than industry averages, but our intent will always be to have zero incidents. Since our founding over 25 years ago, Steel Dynamics has been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of our teams, communities and our environment. We are steel industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with electric arc furnace technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our climate footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. We're starting from a position of strength, yet plan to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth for our stakeholders. But before I continue, Theresa will share some insights into our recent performance. Theresa? Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record third quarter performance with record revenues of $5.1 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record quarterly operating income of $1.3 billion and net income of $991 million or $4.85 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $631 million and adjusted EBITDA of over $1.4 billion, a truly extraordinary performance. Our third quarter 2021 results included costs of $30 million or $0.11 per diluted share associated with the continued construction of our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2021 adjusted net income was $1 billion or $4.96 per diluted share, above our guidance due to stronger than forecast September steel and fabrication earnings. Our third quarter 2021 revenues of $5.1 billion were 14% higher than sequential record second quarter results with improvements in all of our operating platforms, but most significantly from our steel operations based on increased flat rolled steel selling values and strong shipments. Our third quarter 2021 operating income of $1.3 billion was 38% higher than second quarter results, also driven by increased flat rolled steel pricing and continued strong demand, more than offsetting increased raw material ferrous scrap costs. As we discuss our business this morning, we continue to see positive industry fundamentals for the fourth quarter and 2022 and we are focused toward our continued transformational steel growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the third quarter, 33% greater than second quarter sequential earnings as flat rolled steel selling values strengthened and our lagging contract business represented over 80% of our flat roll volume in the quarter. We also saw expanded margins throughout our long product steel operations due to improved pricing. We achieved strong quarterly steel shipments of 2.8 million tons, with our steel mills operating at 93% of their capability. We have additional volume opportunity based on our existing annual steel shipping capacity of over 13 million tons. And when our new Texas steel mill is fully online, we will have over 16 million tons available. Our mills recycling business had operating income in the quarter of $47 million, aligned with strong second quarter performance as higher average pricing resulted in improved ferrous margins. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reducing company-wide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations once again achieved record shipments and significantly expanded margins in the quarter as realized selling values more than offset continued higher steel input costs. Operating income was a record $89 million, more than triple our second quarter earnings of $28 million. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog at the end of the quarter. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further in the fourth quarter and into 2022. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated business model and highly variable cost structure. At the end of the third quarter, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion. During the third quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $631 million and $1.5 billion during the first nine months of the year, also a record. Working capital has grown $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 due to higher selling values, resulting in increased customer account and inventory values. During the first nine months of 2021, we have invested $802 million in capital investments, of which $666 million was invested in our new Texas flat rolled steel mill. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be roughly $220 million. Based on early forecast, capital investments for the full year 2022 could be in the range of $700 million inclusive of a significant portion of investment for the four new flat rolled coating lines to be placed in Sinton and Heartland. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend at $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of this year. We also repurchased $338 million of our common stock, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. Since 2016, we've increased our cash dividend per share over 85% and we've repurchased almost $2 billion of our common stock, representing 21% of our outstanding shares. While during the same timeframe, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating and maintained our growth company profile by investing over $3 billion in organic capital investments and funding $720 million in acquisitions. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit rating. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. Further committing to this path, we recently announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we have also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We have led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase its efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable plan that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. And for those of you that track more individually our flat rolled shipments, for the third quarter of 2021, we had hot rolled coil and P&O shipments of 676,000 tons, cold rolled shipments of 145,000 tons and finally, coated shipments of 1,037,000 tons. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. Well, the steel fabrication platform delivered a tremendous performance, achieving another quarter of record shipments and more than tripling sequential operating income. Based on the strength of steel joist and deck demand, increased product pricing is more than offsetting the continued rise in steel input costs. Quoting and order activity remains extremely strong, resulting in another record order backlog at levels considerably higher than historical peaks. The nonresidential construction market is strong, especially in areas that support online retail, computing activities and pharmaceuticals, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities. We believe this will continue for the foreseeable future due to permanent changes in consumer behavior. Our metals recycling operations had a strong quarter with sequentially higher ferrous metal margins somewhat offsetting marginally lower volume. As we suggested on our second quarter call, prices moderated in August and September after rising throughout the first half of the year. Export prices may support pricing near term but auto recovery will ease prime scrap pressure and compress prime obsolete spreads to more normal levels in the near future, I do believe. The steel team had another outstanding quarter, achieving record operating income of $1.4 billion. During the third quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 85% while our steel mills operated at 93% due to our product diversification, high proportion of value added mix and supply chain differentiation. From a steel end market perspective, the automotive sector is operating at production rates lower than normalized levels due to the continued electronic chip shortage. Fortunately, our specific auto model awards have not been materially affected and we have not yet experienced any significant impact to orders related to the chip shortage. The longer term outlook for the auto industry is positive. Automotive build rate forecast for '22 and '23 continued to be solid at over 15 million and 17 million units respectively. Vehicle inventories continue to be at historically low levels, approximately 70% below the five year average and at the lowest level in over 35 years. The nonresidential construction sector remains strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and order backlogs at our Structural and Rail and steel fabrication businesses. We expect this strength to continue well into next year. Residential construction has also been strong, resulting in high demand for HVAC, for appliances and other related products. We're also seeing healthy demand from mining on yellow goods customers and our Engineered Bar Products Division. And as oil and gas prices increased, we are seeing improved energy sector demand. These positive market dynamics are driving strong steel demand across the platform. The steady demand, coupled with continued historically low absolute inventory levels throughout the supply chain, continue to support strong steel selling values, especially within the flat rolled steel market. We also believe current legislative steel trade policies, including the Section 201 flat roll cases launched in 2015 and 2016 with the subsequent circumvention restrictions will continue to keep steel imports at moderated levels. The current US administration has also committed constructively concerning trade parameters and the issues created by China's steel making overcapacity. Regarding the ongoing negotiations between the US and the EU on revoking 232 tariffs, we expect the final agreement will include a steel quota mechanism to protect US national security goals and eliminate import surge risks. Aside from Turkey, Europe has not been a significant steel input source. We strongly believe that collaborating with our European allies against the real perpetrators of global overcapacity in the steel industry, represented by China and other Asian export based economies, is the most effective path to free trade. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. The most significant growth initiative to date is at the cusp of unleashing transformational change for us and our customers. It's our new Texas electric arc furnace steel mill starting production before the end of this year. The excitement generated by this project from our teams and customers continues to grow. This investment represents competitively advantaged strategic growth for Steel Dynamics and our teams with associated long term value creation for all our stakeholders. This growth initiative represents lower carbon emitting next generation electric arc furnace steel production capability, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions for existing and for new customers. 3 million ton state of the art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and [benefits] our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. The team shipped their first painted coils in September. We anticipate shipping galvanized products early in November and commencing hot-rolled coil production before the end of the year. The Sinton team is doing a terrific job. It is truly a transformational project and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits it will bring to our company, our teams, our customers and our other stakeholders. Vitana Sinton provides a strategic location near Corpus Christi with underserved regional commercial markets representing over 27 million tons of relevant flat rolled steel consumption in the US and Mexico. Our customers are excited to have freight advantaged regional flat roll supplier. We have six customers committed to locate on site, representing 1.8 million tons of annual processing and consumption capability, five of these customers have already broken ground. Based on this geographic location, we can offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting consumers in these areas with lower logistics costs while removing the ocean transit price, quality and delivery risks. We've also made considerable progress concerning our raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. We completed the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August 2020, a critical step. The recycling operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. We also recently acquired three strategic recycling locations in the Houston and Corpus Christi area, further supporting raw material supply for Sinton. Our performance-based operating culture, coupled with a considerable experience in successfully constructing and operating highly profitable steel assets, positions us incredibly well to successfully execute this transformational growth. As I've said before, we're not simply adding flat rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offer sustainable alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We also plan to construct four additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines, comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. The galvanizing line and prepaint line will be located on site to benefit our new Sinton steel mill, while the other two lines will be placed at our Heartland Flat Roll division located in Terrault, Indiana. Each site will thus increase coating capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customers' needs. We expect these lines will begin operating in mid-2023. New Process steel has been a significant customer for these value-added products. In fact, they have grown to be our single largest flat-rolled steel customer in recent years. And importantly, the majority of their business relates to high-margin coated flat-rolled products, which are further manufactured for HVAC, appliance store and automotive applications. Our plans to purchase a 45% minority interest in new process provides us security and supply in these OEM customers. More importantly, the partnership provides Steel Dynamics more exposure to nonautomotive value-added manufacturing in Mexico, a key strategic objective to develop additional downstream pull-through volume, which will help support our new Sinton steel mill. As the majority owner and operator, New Process' CEO, Richard and his management team, will continue to control day-to-day operations, including all decisions concerning steel purchases and product sales. In closing, our culture and the execution of our long-term growth strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation, demonstrating our sustainability and differentiating us from our competition. We are a growth company. The team will continue to identify and execute high-return, organic and transactional growth opportunities while providing attractive shareholder returns. Our people and the spirit of excellence provide the foundation for our success and I thank each of you for your passion and dedication to each other, our customers and our communities. And to our teams, remember that your health and safety are the most important issue at hand, and thank you for the exceptional job you do. So everyone, thank you for joining us today. And Kate, will you please open the line for questions? Operator : Certainly. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Sathish Kasinathan at Deutsche Bank. Your line is live. Sathish Kasinathan : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on growth strategy. In the last call, you mentioned that you don't see any Sinton type greenfield projects on your horizon. Since then, we have seen a couple of new greenfield projects announced by your peers, a few more acquisitions on the raw material side. So just curious on what's your latest thinking regarding organic growth and M&A? Theresa Wagler : Yes. So Satish, I'm not sure that our strategy has necessarily changed because of recent announcements from competitors, I would say that. We're very focused on high-margin organic investments where we can be differentiated through value add or a supply chain or both solution. And so that's what the four coating lines provide from the flat roll side of the business. From an acquisition perspective, we're still very focused and we believe there's a lot of options available now and likely into next year as it relates to both mainly high-end manufacturing businesses that help us with our pull-through volume for our steel mills as well as there might possibly be some tuck-in scrap acquisitions as it relates to building out areas around our steel mills from a strategic perspective and the geographic supply of scrap as well as potentially their steel assets as well, but we're very busy from a growth perspective. Mark, do you have anything to add? Mark Millett : Not really. I think that our strategic path as demonstrated over the years and continues to demonstrate that we always grow in a differentiated way. And so the new projects that are coming online, the changes in the scrap market don't change that outlook. Sathish Kasinathan : Okay. Yes, thanks for the additional color. And my second question is on Sinton. Can you talk about the ramp-up profile in detail? It seems you have trimmed your volume guidance for 2022 by 200,000 tons. When do you expect Sinton to achieve full run rate? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Yes. We did, Sathish, based on the delay in the start-up, which Mark can talk about, they're still doing incredibly well given the circumstances. But we decided that we would probably pull back our estimate from 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons next year to the 2 million to 2.2 million tons. So it's not a huge reduction, but it's a reduction taking into consideration the ramp will start a little bit later in 2021 than we expected. But Mark, maybe you can give some details on when Sinton will be fully operational. Mark Millett : Yes, the actual trajectory of the ramp remains unchanged. It's just the starting point has been delayed a little bit. I would emphasize and echo Theresa, the team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job in bringing such a huge scale project online. We have had a couple of issues just recently that has delayed it into late November, early December. We have a crane delivery issue that slipped just literally last week by a couple of weeks. The recent COVID wave in Texas impacted the number of contractors available on site each day. And to be honest, as areas have opened up just recently on the electrical side, we've had a tough time getting night shift electricians on board to complete it in mid-November. So it has slid here another two or three weeks. We're still confident for an end of year start-up. The paint line has been running, running quality product that shipped coil in September. We expect the galvanizing line to -- it's up going through final commissioning, and should be shipping coils here early November. Theresa Wagler : And Sathish, to answer your last question, we would expect that they would be at a full run rate likely by midyear 2022. Sathish Kasinathan : Okay, great. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. Our next question today is coming from Martin Englert at Seaport Research Partners. Your line is live. Martin Englert : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Mark Millett : Good morning. Theresa Wagler : Good morning. Martin Englert : Do you expect the lag in flat-rolled contracts will remain around 80% of your flat order book into 4Q and then moving into next year? And then maybe if you can also touch on the contract dynamics, specifically the potential elimination of discounts on the lagging contracts for next year. Mark Millett : We'll likely finish the year ahead around a bit on flat roll, around about 80% -- 75%, 80% on the contract side. As Sinton picks up steam next year that would probably slide to around about 70% of the flat roll base. Relative to sort of terms of contracts, obviously, those are discussions that are ongoing. We have finalized a few and contract terms are somewhat advantaged over previous past periods. Principally on the range, the volume ranges are contracting, so that we have a greater control of the order book as the market fluctuates. Martin Englert : Okay. Thanks for that color there. And some of this you touched on in your prepared remarks, but can you kind of discuss your metallic strategy, if that's changing heading into next year, specifically, there's three flat-rolled EAF mills that are ramping capacity near-term, all of which are going to require prime scrap and/or substitutes. And do you feel that there is ample North American supply of primes or will more imports of substitutes be required or some other strategy? Mark Millett : Well, I've been in the business for 40 years now. And every year, people are worried about whether you can get scrap next year as the EAF industry is continue to grow. And today, the EAF industry is around about 70%, growing to 75% or thereabouts. I do believe some of the recent alternative iron units, almost 1.8 million tons or whatever from Cleveland-Cliffs certainly helps. And I would imagine that over time, we'll see more investment in those products going forward. I think you're also going to see a reduction of prime scrap required by the electric arc furnace community. We've been very successful over the last \u2013 well, since last March, reducing our prime scrap, our busheling and bundle requirements from 60% of the mix down to 40% of the mix through better processing at our scrap facilities. So that will certainly ease the - any volume demand there. So we think it will grow or the scrap volume, which is grow in lockstep with increased capacity. It may take a few more dollars to draw out the obsolete grades, that's historically been very elastic. And as you saw recently with the higher pricing, obsolete grades flowed very, very well. Martin Englert : What specifically changed with your scrap processing that dropped it from 60% to 40% of primes? Mark Millett : Well, I'd be giving away trade secrets, if I told you the detail there, but obviously, just better separating techniques. Martin Englert : Okay, appreciate the color there. And congratulations on the results and the positive outlook. Mark Millett : Super, thank you very much. Team did a great job. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Emily Chieng at Goldman Sachs. Emily Chieng : My first question is around capital allocation. I believe in the past, you've mentioned that you'd be looking at increasing the dividend once Sinton comes online. Can you perhaps give us a sense of the magnitude of that bump and perhaps when we should be expecting that to take place? Theresa Wagler : Well, from a magnitude perspective, that's difficult, Emma, and I appreciate the question, but that's a board decision. I would tell you, if you looked at history, when we've had transformational growth that we believed provided sustainable through-cycle cash flow increase, such as when we purchased the Columbus Flat Roll division and we were finished transforming that early in the kind of 2016 time frame, you would have seen several 20% increases in our dividend profile at that point in time. I don't think that that is unreasonable at all. As far as the timing, I would fully expect to see something happen in the early part of 2022. But again, that's a board decision and so I guess more to come on that. Emily Chieng : And then a follow-up just around sort of the acquisition there. Can you perhaps talk around the rationale around the acquisition of 45% minority ownership of New Process steel rather than perhaps a full 100% ownership there? I'll leave it at that. Mark Millett : Again, as we mentioned, New Process has grown to be our largest customer. It has a particular concentration of value-add prepaint to OEM customers and we wanted to ensure security in that supply chain going forward. But as importantly, if not more importantly, they have a strong focus on downstream manufacturing, particularly in Mexico. And that is aligned with our strategic desires and objectives to increase pull-through volume. And so that would add support to our Sinton facility. Theresa Wagler : The minority position really, Emma, allows that management team and Richard Fant to continue to run the business, basically unchanged. And that's something that was attractive to us at this point in time. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Michael Glick at JPMorgan. Michael Glick : Costs are obviously top of mind for the market right now. You've already hit on scrap. But could you talk a bit about what you're seeing on the cost side outside of scrap, including energy and raw materials and any supply chain issues you're monitoring or working to mitigate? Mark Millett : Well, I think the energy pricing here has risen to some degree. But again, natural gas cost is a very, very small percentage of our overall cost structure. On the raw material side, probably ferrosilicon is the only item that we're actually watching and taking steps to ensure a secure supply there. Theresa Wagler : Actually, throughout the supply chain, especially on the steel side but in the other operating platforms as well with the supply disruptions that everyone is experiencing across any industry at this point in time, whether it relates to logistics or just lack of supply chain stability, we actually have been doing a very deep dive into looking at the relationships we have with suppliers and to have redundancy in suppliers, et cetera. That's something that we do regularly but we're refocused on it as well. And at this point in time, we feel very good about, I'll call them, consumables, the supply of consumables. Obviously, natural gas is very highly priced and going into the winter months, I think a lot of people are expecting that natural gas might continue to rise. Obviously, it is in rest of the world but possibly in the US as well. But that means that, as Mark mentioned, being 100% electric arc furnace is only a couple of percentages of our cost profile. So we're feeling pretty good heading into 2022 at this point. Michael Glick : And then on the fabrication business, I mean, you talked about the record backlog and pricing. But curious what sort of order of magnitude you're seeing in pricing versus what you posted this quarter just given the lead times associated with that business. And really just trying to get a handle on the staying power of the earnings in that segment. Mark Millett : Well, I guess the stain power or the health of that industry is, in my mind, phenomenal. Number one, as said in my earlier remarks, there certainly has been a permanent change in consumer sort of mindset. And so the online retail purchasing is just driving massive distribution warehouse type construction, cloud computing activity likewise. And we're seeing projects and honestly being pushed out 10 months. Our backlog is even longer than 10 months. And you might say people are concerned about the labor shortage and those sorts of things, but in a strange way, that's actually helping extend this whole economic cycle and pushing those projects out. So we are very, very, very bullish in that arena for 2022. Theresa Wagler : You asked the question about how much further pricing could move. So we can't give you specifics but it's a meaningful increase, because as they have the backlog that Mark mentioned that's almost a year out, you already have that product pricing substantiated. And so that's why in my opening remarks people may not have picked it up, but I may mention the fact that we do expect to have increased fabrication earnings in the fourth quarter as well as into 2022 and that's based off of the record comparison of the third quarter. So there's substantial earnings uplift that we're expecting from the steel fabrication segment. Mark Millett : And I would just add -- I think I saw one comment this morning, but maybe there was a change in tone of our press release. I would just want to emphasize that we're as bullish, if not more bullish for the fourth quarter and going into next year as we ever have been. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Carlos De Alba at Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : So I wonder if you could comment or elaborate a little bit more on your growth strategy. And how would you either rank or prioritize potentially investments in additional capacity above and beyond potentially further investments are sized the quarter lines that you have already announced and the scrap processors and locations that you have acquired recently. Is it another greenfield, something that you would prioritize over more targeted acquisitions and/or further downstream investments? Mark Millett : We had a tough time understanding the whole question there. So if I don't answer it, just come back and hit me again. But on the recycling side, I think you were suggesting or asking whether or not we have major plans in transactions or growing that business. I would say, again, we've said this in the past, we're not interested in growing our recycling platform for the sake of just growth. We will continue to identify regional assets that complement our steel mills, such as we did in the Southwest about purchasing those three yards and then also the Zimmer acquisition in Mexico. But there's not a wholesale change in our recycling strategy whatsoever. We will continue\u2026 Carlos De Alba : And what about further investments after Sinton including steel capacity? Theresa Wagler : So what Carlos is asking is after Sinton is complete and after we have the four value-added lines that are processing, what greenfield might come after that? Mark Millett : Well, I do believe we will continue to focus on value-add opportunities downstream, more so in processing. The greenfield project of Sinton was a very unique opportunity, at least in my eyes. It was a combination of differentiating ourselves relative to product, bringing new supply chain solutions to our customer base and having a very, very unique sort of geographic location to serve those customers. We wouldn't build another greenfield facility unless it had truly differentiating characteristics. And it's difficult to see that, that will avail itself in the US today. And then the other sort of strategic path we've continued to chase is downstream sort of fabrication, manufacturing and we would be looking to do that both in the U.S. and in Mexico. Carlos De Alba : And Theresa, if I may ask you, how do you see working capital in the fourth quarter? Clearly, prices are still very high, raw materials are increasing your [forecast] for the fourth quarter for another record result. So is it fair to assume mostly higher working capital levels. But do you have a sense of the magnitude of how much cash that would consume in the last quarter of the year? Theresa Wagler : There's a few things happening at the same time in the fourth quarter. So we will have higher average steel selling values simply because of the carryover in the lagging contract business that we mentioned from the Flat Roll Group. And in addition to that, we'll be ramping up Sinton. And so we'll be putting additional working capital both through steel substrate and through scrap on the ground as they begin to produce. So I would expect to see a continued use of cash in working capital. I don't expect it to be close to the same magnitude that we saw in the third quarter. We also in the third quarter had some building at Sinton as well. So I would expect maybe a couple of hundred million dollar build but nothing beyond that. Again, it's a very difficult thing to monitor when prices continue to rise but I think that's probably a good estimate at this point. Operator : Our next question today is coming from David Gagliano at BMO. David Gagliano : I just have actually a few numbers related questions. I think in the Q&A last quarter, you indicated preliminary 2022 CapEx of $550 million to $600 million. And I thought I heard you say on this call earlier that you ex CapEx to be $750 million for 2022. And I also noticed that the rolling mill start-up looks like it's been pushed out to 2023 versus what I thought was mid-2022 previously. So my first questions are A, what is the driver for the higher 2022 CapEx, if that's correct and B, what is the driver for pushing the rolling mill start-ups to mid-2023 versus 2022 previously? Theresa Wagler : So to address your last question first, if you're speaking about the rolling mill, David, are you talking about the Sinton rolling mill? David Gagliano : I thought effectively, there was commentary back in April, I think it was. And then again, in the last quarter that that just in general, the four rolling mills would be starting up by mid-2022. Perhaps I got that wrong. Theresa Wagler : The value-added lines, no. So the value-add lines we had hoped to be in the second half of 2022. But given the engineering of the lines and just the delivery of equipment at this point in time, it's pushing us back to now, we think those lines will be operational in the first half of 2023. So you're correct, that is a change but that has to do with the engineering and the equipment delivery time line. As it relates to capital spending for 2022, you're correct. On the last quarter call, we would have given something closer to the $600 million range, but that's prior to us doing the deep dive that we do every fall into capital projects. And as you'll remember, there's so much of all of our team members' compensation at risk to performance and high return investments, they always put together to wish list of very good investment opportunities that would result in higher compensation for them if they have high returns. So we went through that process. And at this point in time, that's added probably about $100 million to the capital that we expect to spend next year and that would be projects that we believe will have a very good return profile to it. Some of them will start next year. Some of them will just have the money spent and then kind of roll into 2023. But there's no one significant project that's adding to that. Most of that $700 million is actually tied to the four value-added flat roll lines. David Gagliano : The four value-added flat roll lines that were pushed to 2023, and I apologize I called rolling mill, I apologize. You're right. Before value-add flat-rolled lines that were pushed, I think to 2023, but then there's other projects in there that raised the total from $550 million to $600 million to $750 million. So $150 million to $200 million higher versus last quarter on some other projects. Is that right? Theresa Wagler : So they're high return projects and there are spreads throughout fabrication, the steel mills, we're adding some inspection lines likely down at our SBQ facility. So there's just a lot of individual projects like that, David, that aren't significant individually. But as they added together, it's a higher number. David Gagliano : And then just one other one for me. Operationally, shipments overall were down 5% in the third quarter. Obviously, production was great. Shipments were down 5% in the third quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Can you just talk about what was the main driver for the quarter-over-quarter decline? And what's a reasonable assumption for shipments in terms of quarter-over-quarter change in the typically seasonally weak fourth quarter? Mark Millett : I don't think we typically will project future shipments. But you're right, shipments in the third quarter were off a little. We build inventory and principally as amount of transportation, just getting rail and trucks to move that material. We would expect, for sure, though, to move that in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Curt Woodworth at Credit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : Mark, I wanted to get your thoughts on some of the different demand verticals. Obviously, we're hearing a lot of issues with respect to the supply chain chip shortages in auto, very long lead times in appliance, HVAC. And you kind of made the point that you felt the labor shortages, to some degree, we're actually bullish for fabrication just because it's kind of elongating maybe the pace at which these projects are going to get completed. So the market, it seems like it softened a little bit here with lead times coming in. There could be some seasonality. So I was just wondering if you could maybe briefly walk us through what you're seeing on some of your key demand verticals. Mark Millett : And again, we are bullish, especially, we're not bullish across all our sectors. As you said and as I said, construction, that cycle has been extended, I do believe, incredibly healthy. And in part because those projects are just getting pushed out because of a shortage of labor and with the contractors and the builders I talked to across the country that they're all experiencing the same thing and they're all seeing long-term strength. So that's on the nonres construction side, we think it's very, very, very strong. In a way, in the automotive arena, you've seen a similar thing except it's the chip shortage that is slowing things down and we'll, in my humble opinion, extend that cycle dramatically. COVID itself cost us about 4.5 million units, and that has to get caught up. The pent-up demand out there, if you listen to the dealers is absolutely phenomenal. I was just -- to one deal last week, typically would have 1,600 vehicles in inventory right now, and you can only manage to get 100. And that experience is being shared with other dealers across the country. And the desire, the pent-up demand is absolutely there. And so that will maintain strength in the automotive arena. And in my humble opinion, when the chip shortage relieves itself, all they're going to do is just ramp up and maximize the output for the next couple of years because there's that much demand out there in my mind. And then across other areas, residential was strong, HVAC appliance is strong. We're seeing a little more strength in the energy sector, more downhole kind of with the drilling rig as opposed to distribution pipe, that's still soft and it'll be soft for another year probably. Yellow goods is pretty strong. And just Engineering Bar, in general. Their customer base is expecting a 20% increase year-over-year. So that tends to give us some positive support too. So it's just generally a very, very, very strong demand scenario. Curt Woodworth : And then a quick follow-up. With respect to the buyback, when you look at the free cash flow profile and the balance sheet, I mean, you have very significant capability to continue to buy back stock here and your stock, at least on my numbers trading at the cheapest level I think it's ever traded. So just curious to kind of get your thoughts on maybe how you see the buyback going forward, will be opportunistic or more steady? And I'll leave it there. Theresa Wagler : Yes, we feel very good about the capital structure and the foundation that the teams have been able to put into place. And so you've seen us be, we think, very active with the buyback program in the second quarter with very similar activity in the third quarter. I think one should expect to see us continue to have a very steady pace unless we were to come up onto a time frame where we believe that there might be a better use for those funds through strategic growth of either organic or inorganic opportunities. So at this point in time, we believe we will be very active in the buyback program. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser at UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Just a quick follow-up on the auto demand. So your auto volumes or steel volumes are pretty solid. Obviously, chip shortage is weighing on production. There's been some talk about the EAFs in the US capturing market share from [integrated]. Is that partly what's happening here? Are you seeing yourself capturing auto steel market share here from the integrators at this point in time? Mark Millett : Well, we've over the last couple of years, have steadily grown market share, particularly out of our Columbus facility. Butler has always been around 28%, 30% automotive. Columbus, when we purchased it in 2015, had just incremental amount and that's grown to probably 300,000, 400,000 tons today. And I think we've got some unique products that bring value to the automotive supply chain. But probably as importantly today is the sustainability story, particularly with the European auto maintenance. We've had a lot of traction with BMW, with VW, with Mercedes, in particular. And they view our sustainability model and our carbon footprint as being among the best in the world. And so that has sort of earned considerable business. And we're also benefiting and honestly from the USMCA. That increase in domestic content from 50% to 70% has necessitated those European manufacturers to source internal to the US, and that's driven a lot of our success as well. Andreas Bokkenheuser : And maybe as a follow-up, I mean, obviously, the auto contract negotiations going on. I'm not going to ask about pricing, but just in terms of timing. I mean, to what extent are you involved in all of this and when do you usually see these things ramping up? Mark Millett : Typically or historically, automotive was the purview of the bastion of the integrated mills because they necessitate or mandated sort of an annual fixed price contract scenario. And with the variability in the scrap markets or the volatility of scrap markets, it's something the electric arc furnace producer can stand. But given the volatility in 2015 and 2016 in pricing, the automotive folks saw that they left a lot of money on the table. And so they hedge between integrated and electric-arc-furnace supply chains today. The propensity of the automotive contract negotiations in the fall with the integrated producers not necessarily the electric arc furnace producers. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Tristan Gresser at Exane BNP Paribas. Tristan Gresser : And maybe following up on the previous one, you obviously have near term targets to cut your emissions, carbon emission and some peers in Europe have tied their decarbonization savings to create new commercial offering of low carbon steel products that sell premium with good demand from companies to keep looking to cut their Scope 3 emission. Is that also something you would consider? And do you see a similar market emerging for low carbon steel products in the US? Mark Millett : Well, you've seen just recently folks pursuing that direction. I would say for SDI to date, we've been the beneficiary of, again, capturing greater market share and haven't necessarily leveraged that to higher pricing as of this moment in time. I would imagine, though, over time, you could see a differentiation there. Tristan Gresser : And maybe just one question on market conditions and the pricing outlook. You have imports surging in the US, inventories building and of course, this new capacity is going to ramp up. The forward curve in US HRC is around 1,300 by March next year. I think in previous call, you were a bit more probably bullish on the near term. Has anything changed to your view in the supply and demand dynamics at the moment that could warrant this drop in steel prices? Mark Millett : Well, there's absolutely no doubt that demand is there. I wouldn't necessarily characterize the imports as surging necessarily. Certainly, Galvalume, prepaint Galvalume is very, very strong, I'll give you that. But today, we saw some offers from Vietnam for April, May delivery. So the way, way, way out at around $1,500. So I would imagine pricing will turn over to some degree or I use the word erode, but it's not going to be a massive reduction. The market cynics out there that are suggesting that average pricing for the year is $740 a ton or $750. I just can't see that happening with the demand picture the way it is today. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I just wanted to follow up on new process. I'll just ask one question with two parts, if I could. New Process is a big -- I guess, a bit of a deviation. It's acquiring one of your customers or at least partly. And I know in the past, there's been some trepidation over that, partly because you kind of compete with your other customers. So I just wanted your thoughts on that. And on the one hand, if you're concerned about the message it sends to other customers. And second, I wanted to ask if this is a new opportunity for Steel Dynamics to continue to move downstream into kind of more of the processing going forward with further capital allocation in that regard? Mark Millett : Well, I'd want to emphasize that I wouldn't necessarily look at the acquisition as a change in strategy for us. We certainly don't want to get into the service center business per se. We would be probably lousy in the service center business, to be honest. As I said earlier, there are two principal objectives. One, New Process grew to a very large customer in the value-add prepaint sort of supply chain and just wanted to secure that supply chain or that outlet to OEMs way into the future. And then secondly, we were looking for sort of a platform of growth for manufacturing, downstream manufacturing and that aligns -- New Process aligns well with that strategy, particularly in Mexico. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Andrew Keches at Barclays. Andrew Keches : Just one to put a finer point on the capital allocation priorities here. But Theresa, you've gradually been refinancing the old [Technical Difficulty] bonds and you have one left that's callable here in the fourth quarter. Should we expect that refinancing trend to continue or I guess, considering the outlook for cash flow, is there any consideration to possibly just paying that down to get yourselves to an even stronger balance position going forward? Theresa Wagler : So it's a great question. You're right that it's a $400 million tranche and it has, I think, a 5% rate attached to it. The investment grade market has been very supportive of Steel Dynamics and we're very excited to be in that market today. So we are very comfortable, I guess, the first point with the debt structure that we have. We really manage to a through-cycle basis at a leverage of 2 times or less. So obviously, we're much less than that today but we're managing to through cycles. I can't give you specifics because I would get in trouble if I did but there is an opportunity to either repay or refinance and we'll be making that decision here in the near term. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Kate. And I just would like to emphasize to everyone on the call, our customers, our service providers and particularly our team, thank you for your support. It was an absolutely phenomenal quarter. We're going to see another one in the fourth quarter and it's only driven by, again, each and every one of you is supporting our company, Steel Dynamics. We will endeavor to continue our growth trajectory going forward and creating even greater shareholder value and well. So thank you, and everyone out there, be safe. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's event. You may disconnect at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David, and good morning, everybody. Happy 2022. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. We all appreciate your time and thank you for joining us today. The entire Steel Dynamics team delivered an exceptional performance in 2021 with record sales, earnings, and cash flow generation. The team totally shared the previous full year records. It was a tremendous achievement certainly supported by a strong market, but driven by the commitment and passion of our teams executing on our long-term strategies that continue to grow on through cycle and the capability. Thank you, team, for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. I'm proud to work alongside you. Due to the steadfast commitment, our people helped to one another and their families to our communities and to our customers, we are operating safely amidst the extended pandemic. The health and welfare of our teams remain paramount. Record financial results are no important while teams did not remain safe. Although our safety performance continues to be better than industry averages, our safety performance deteriorated year-over-year. This is an unacceptable trend that we're working diligently to resolve as our intent will always to have zero incidents. Since our founding over 25 years ago, we've been intentional in managing our resources sustainably for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. We are steel industry leader in sustainability, operating exclusively with electric arc furnace technology with a differentiated circular manufacturing business model. As our journey continues, we are committed to the reduction of our climate footprint, including a practical and achievable goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. We're starting from a position of strength, yet plan to do more. We're competitively positioned and focused towards generating long-term sustainable growth. But before I continue with additional market commentary, I'd like Theresa to share insights into our recent performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Good to be with you. I'd like to add my sincere appreciation and congratulate the entire team. We continue to achieve new milestones throughout the business, attaining record annual performance, with record revenues of $18.4 million derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of $4.3 billion and net income of $3.2 billion or $15.56 per diluted share and record cash flow from operations of $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of over $4.6 billion, truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2021 results, net income was $1.09 billion or $5.49 per diluted share, which includes additional performance-based company-wide special compensation of approximately $21 million or $0.08 per diluted share, which was awarded to all non-executive eligible team members in recognition of their extraordinary performance. Our fourth quarter contribution to the company\u2019s charitable foundation is $10 million or $0.04 per diluted share and costs of approximately $52 million or $0.18 per diluted share associated with the construction and startup of our Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill. Excluding these items, fourth quarter 2021 adjusted net income was over $1.15 billion or $5.78 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter 2021 record revenues of $5.3 billion were 4% higher than sequential third quarter results, driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and our flat rolled steel operations. Our fourth quarter 2021 record operating income of $1.4 billion was 8% higher than sequential results, driven by the continued demand trends at our steel fabrication operations. As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2022, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated record operating income of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, as increased realized selling values expanded margins across the steel platform, offsetting seasonally lower volumes. Our lagging flat rolled contract business represented approximately 80% to 85% of our total flat roll volume in the quarter. We had quarterly steel shipments of 2.7 million tons, with our steel mill operating at 88% of their capability. For the full year 2021, our steel operations achieved numerous financial and operational milestones. The platform's full year operating income was a record $4.4 billion, with record shipments of 11.2 million tons, a truly phenomenal performance. Now to remind you, we still have additional market opportunity, mostly within our long products group and in line with the startup of our Sinton, Texas mill. Because based on our existing annual steel shipping capability, we have over 13 million tons of shipping capability on the steel side and with Sinton fully ramped, it will be over 16 million tons. Operating income from our metals recycling operations for the fourth quarter remained strong at $44 million, based on the improved metal margins offsetting lower share of shipments. Many domestic steel mills have planned maintenance outages throughout the fourth quarter, lowering various scrap metals. For the full year 2021, operating income for metals recycling operations was a record $195 million driven by uniquely higher volume and average selling value for both ferrous and non-ferrous recycling. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing and operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements Our steel fabrication operations also achieved record operating income in the quarter of $238 million, 2.5 times record third quarter results, driven by materially higher realized selling value, which more than offset escalated average steel \u2013 steel input costs. For the full year 2021, our steel fabrication platform achieved another record year with operating income of $365 million and record volumes of 789,000 tons, both steel sheets [ph]. Congratulations to the team. Steel joist and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity, resulting in another record order backlog in the quarter, extending throughout 2022. Based on our backlog and customer sentiment, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase into 2022. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly durable cost structure. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and are fully available and secure revolver of $1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we generated record cash flow from operations of $724 million and $2.2 billion for the full year, also a reference. Working capital grew $1.7 billion during the year due to higher selling values resulting in increased customer account and inventory value. During 2021, we invested $1 billion in capital investments, of which $831 million was invested in our new Texas flat rolled steel mill. During 2022, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $750 million, the majority of which relates to four new flat-rolled coating mines to be placed in Sinton and Heartland. Regarding shareholder distributions, we maintained our quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share after increasing at 4% in the first quarter of 2021. We also repurchased $330 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter, representing 3% of outstanding shares. At December 31, we had $383 million remaining on the price for repurchase under that program. In the past five years, we've increased our cash dividend per share of about 86%, and we repurchased $2.3 billion of our common stock, representing 23% of outstanding shares. While during the same timeframe, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating and maintained our growth company profile by investing $3.1 million in organic capital investments and funding [indiscernible]. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth, with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of this strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest level of integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we also have interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We've led the steel industry with an exclusive use of electric arc furnace steelmaking technology, circular manufacturing model and innovative solutions to increase efficiency, reduce raw material usage, reuse secondary materials and promote material conservation and recycling. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our climate goals through, among other avenues, implementing emission reduction projects, improving energy management, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technologies. We have an actionable path that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for our traditional blast furnace industry peers. Our sustainability and climate strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We play an industry leadership role moving forward. Thank you, Mark. Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. And as you said, our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2021, achieving record volume and earnings. The earnings power of this platform in a strong construction environment is yet to be completely displayed. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was at a record level for both volume and forward pricing, extending through March of 2022. The nonresidential construction market remains sound, especially in areas that support online retail, data centers, schools and health care, specifically represented by construction of distribution warehouse facility. Our steel fabrication operations provide a powerful natural hedge to our steel production operations in a steady or softening steel price environment. Our metals recycling operations also performed well this year, achieving record annual earnings and strong volume growth. The acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in August of 2020 has proven to be both strategic supply and an excellent investment, combining a great financial result with the additional benefit of growing access to prime scrap at North Central Mexico in support of our southern electric arc furnace at flat roll steel mill. The metals recycling footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap-generating steel customers. We have ample access to ferrous scrap supply, including prime scrap and believe this will remain the case in the future. The steel team had an incredible year, achieving record volume and also record earnings of $4.4 billion, which eclipsed previous peaks. During 2021, the domestic steel industry operated at a production utilization rate of 81%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 91%. We consistently operate at a higher utilization due to our value-add steel diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. As we suggested during our last earnings call, new capacity and moderate import growth is pressured to hot-rolled coil price. Supply side issues have largely been resolved and lead times are back to manageable levels after ballooning post COVID as manufacturing steel demand recovered much more fruitfully than expected by the industry. Hot-rolled coil pricing has moderated. But contrary to recent alarmist commentary, the magnitude of the price correction is in no way connected to any material in overall demand. Inventory levels have certainly normalized the pre-COVID levels but are more than appropriate for the present demand environment. December MSCI shipments dropped to approximately 2.4 million tons, but this is consistent with typical seasonality, not an abnormality. Monthly import levels have undergone controlled growth in recent months as the arbitrage expanded. But as anticipated, there's been no surge. The recent hot-rolled coil price declines should effectively eradicate import volume growth in the months ahead. These are natural market adjustments and are not structural changes. Hot-rolled transactions are currently consistent with published index numbers in the range of $1,300 to $1,400 per ton. There are a limited number of large volume spot hot band offerings that can be procured at lower numbers, but these are not prevalent or reflective of the market in general. One must recognize that the spot comp and market has diminished in size over recent years as contract businesses increased across the industry. Therefore, it's not necessarily a true indicator of the whole market. Current hot-band spot offers are based on import values today, which are quickly drying up as the arbitrage strengths. Traders are reportedly finding it difficult to execute any business for second quarter delivery. Throughout our history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and create valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, over 70% [ph] of our steel sales are considered value-add. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through-cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain steadfast in our optimism for 2022. After a short period of seasonally lower steel demand in November and December, our flat-rolled order input rate in January was one of the best months ever. And backlogs are very healthy. Automotive sector steel consumption should grow year-over-year as the chip shortage eases, fueled by an extreme lack of dealer inventory, which is 60% lower than normal, and strong pent-up demand. The automotive sector operated at production rates lower than normalized levels in 2020 and 2021, around about 13 million units and is expected to grow to 15 million units this year and 17 million units in 2023. Nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural and rail division and steel fabrication businesses. Residential construction has also been reversed, resulting in high demand for HVAC material, appliance and other related products. Stronger energy prices are now pushing up the rig count and associated under new pipe production. In aggregate, our steel backlogs and our order input strength, coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum, drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong through 2022. We anticipate steel demand increasing year-over-year and with a likely retraction of import volumes possibly a moderate rebound in pricing. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous value creation. Our new Sinton, Texas flat roll steel mill represents our most significant investment to date, providing the avenue for transformational growth and opportunity for ourselves and our customers. This differentiated investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for all of our stakeholders, from our teams and customers, to our vendors and shareholders. This EAF steel mill represents next-generation lower carbon emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon from our competition. It provides us with a more diverse steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate-conscious supply option. The Sinton construction team has experienced numerous challenges related to supply chain disruptions and COVID impacts. These challenges resulted in hot-side production shifting from the end of 2021 to a class start before the end of February 2022. The Sinton group navigated through the challenges as well and we are on the verge of seeing the significant benefits this facility will generate. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in an underserved steel consumer region and represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat-rolled steel consumption in the US and Mexico. These customers are excited to have a freight advantage regional flat-rolled steel supplier. We have six customers committed to locate on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability. Five of these customers have already broke ground. We can offer shorter delivery times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution to the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast, benefiting our customers in these areas with lower logistics costs, removing risks associated with ocean transit, quality, and delivery. We have also made considerable progress in setting our raw material procurement strategy to the mill. As I mentioned, the acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company is a critical source of prime scrap supply. They are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico and have already done a great job growing volume with a lot more to come. Sinton is not simply adding flat-rolled steel production capacity. We have a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, a significant geographic freight and lead-time advantage, and offer a sustainable alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We're also going to build four additional value-added flat-rolled coating lines comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing in lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Our existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. One galvanizing line and one paint line will be located on site at Sinton, while the other two lines will be placed at our Heartland Flat Roll division located in Terrault, Indiana. Each site will increase flat-tolled capacity by 540,000 tons to further support our regional flat-rolled steel operations, providing them with more value-added product diversification to serve our customers. We expect these lines will begin operating in mid-2023. In closing, our unique culture and the execution of our long-term growth and capital allocation strategy continues to strengthen our financial position through strong cash flow generation and long-term value creation. Our sustainable, symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability, differentiating us from any competition. We're excited to continue our growth with new value-creating opportunities. Our people and the spirit of excellence provides the foundation for our success. I thank each of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So, everyone, thank you for joining us today and, Kate, will you please open the line for questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question to facilitate time for everyone. Any additional questions can be addressed upon reentering the queue. Our first question today is coming from Michael Glick at JPMorgan Securities. Your line is live, you may begin. Michael Glick : Good morning. In your fabrication segment, could you give us a bit more color about how we should think about the trajectories of both pricing and margins moving through the year? Any ranges there would be helpful. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, Michael. So I think on the last quarter call, we mentioned that we have firm expectations that the fabrication business is going to earn more earnings in the first half of 2022 than in the second half of 2021. We believe we\u2019ll invest firmly in that. So as I mentioned in my remarks, there is an expectation that we see another improvement in the first quarter and in the second quarter as well based on the backlog. So there's more visibility in fabrication, because the backlog is still lengthy, but also because of the pricing that we're seeing that we're able to achieve, as demand remains incredibly strong. So as far as specifics, it's hard to give specifics. I will just tell you that first quarter will definitely be, I think, meaningfully higher than what we saw in the fourth quarter and, again, another step function increase in the second quarter as well. Michael Glick : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Emily Chieng at Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Mark and Theresa and thank you for the update today. My question is just around growth. Now that Sinton is coming towards the end there, and you've got a couple of coating lines and galv lines in the hopper, how do you think about other greenfield growth potential in your portfolio, particularly as it relates to the rebar segment? Do you have a view as to whether or not you need to see further capacity growth in the long product side from Steel Dynamics? Thank you. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Emily for your question. I think, the -- we will continue to, I think, demonstrate our sort of organic growth opportunities. In all honestly, rebar is not a focus of ours. It certainly has given us diversification in our structure and rail division and Roanoke Bar division, and we'll flex that as markets go up and down. But that rebar is not a target, so to speak, of any major growth. We will continue to grow in the value-added business. Obviously, I think, we've demonstrated that the strategic path has been very intentional and very, very profitable for us. And more importantly, it allows us that diversity of product mix to sustain higher utilization levels through the cycle. So I think that there's still opportunity to further value-add processing on the flat rolled side of things. Additionally, though, it's an intriguing marketplace out there, and we're seeing a pipeline that is full of transactional opportunities today as well. Emily Chieng : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning and Happy New Year. Mark Millett : Happy New Year Timna Tanners : Thanks. Happy New Year. I want to ask a little bit more about what you're seeing in the first quarter in terms of volumes. Clearly, the softer spot market that prevailed as you mentioned in the fourth quarter with some of the lighter volumes has spilled over a bit to the first quarter. And wondering any early thoughts about what that could mean for shipments quarter-over-quarter. Any thoughts on what's driving that and what might cause that to stabilize? Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, I think we certainly saw the seasonality. And as I said earlier, there is one headline that MSCI shows that 17% compared to August and December. Well, if you look at it each year in history, it always does that. And it's just -- the seasonal adjustment is going to sort of disappear in the fourth quarter -- I mean first quarter of the year. The shipping volumes we would anticipate will increase accordingly. Timna Tanners : Do you expect normal increase from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in your shipping volumes across the board? Mark Millett : Pretty much, yes. Timna Tanners : Okay. Interesting. Thanks. Mark Millett : Again, we're not seeing -- people, I think, are relating a little bit of pricing softness here with demand. And as I said earlier, demand through our lens is incredibly strong and will remain so throughout the year. Theresa Wagler : The only thing I would add just to that, Timna, that we actually experienced at the end of the fourth quarter some logistics issues as well like I'm sure people are experiencing outside the steel industry as well as trucking and rail, and things have been disrupted. So there were shipments that we expected to actually deliver in December that we're not able to be delivered. So it's more of a timing issue. So that's going to benefit the first quarter as well. Timna Tanners : Okay. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld at Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is live. Seth Rosenfeld : Good afternoon. If I can follow-up, please, with the outlook for free cash flow and in particular the role of working capital. Obviously, the last year, in particular, Q4, saw a lot of investment in working capital. There were some delays of Sinton ramp-up. Wondering if that was one reason particularly elevated investments in Q4. And with that in mind, can you give us a bit of color on expectations, both outcome in Q1 and for the year ahead? Is it reasonable to assume that with Sinton ramp-up a slightly decline in ASPs for sheet, we could expect a meaningful working capital release? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, Seth, thanks for the question. So yes, working capital, we did see significant growth during 2021, most of which is associated with the value growth in our steel products and in the increased volume and product pricing growth in our fabrications business. Sinton, at the end of the year, had about $150 million of working capital and we would expect to see that grow by probably end of the year $50 million during 2022. So in the first half of the year, there's still some structural growth attached to that. But otherwise, as we see product pricing fees and we see the strength in volume, so we would expect to see valuations come down, which should have a pretty significant working capital release during the entirety of the year. You might not see as much of it in the first half, but definitely in the second half of the year. Seth Rosenfeld : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser at UBS. Your line is live. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you. Just a question on inflation. I mean, obviously, it's a bit of an inflationary environment. How are you kind of thinking about inflation this year? Is there anything you kind of got on the table that can kind of mitigate inflation and looking at energy, even scrap? I mean, you've already integrated some scrap yards. Is there room for more scrap yard integration and acquisition there? That's the question on inflation. Thank you very much. Mark Millett : Well, I think the -- we can't speak to the overall impact of inflation on the domestic economy. But relative to SDI, I think we're not impacted dramatically. Obviously, scrap will ramp to the marketplace. But from a cost of sort of conversion, we're relatively under control. We have been impacted a little by our cost and we've been impacted by the zinc cost over the last 12, 18 months moving up, but most of which is passed through -- the hourly cost, which sell is higher at our engineered bar division than any other mill, again, that tends to be passed to the customers. So we're not seeing a massive inflationary impact to our cost structure. Theresa Wagler : I would add -- and Andreas, I know you know this. As it relates to wages where a lot of people are seeing a really significant increase because we have so much of our compensation across the entire team that's performance-based, and it naturally fluctuates. So, we're not seeing the same pressure from a wage perspective because there's so much of the performance bonus compensation that's structurally in place. So I think Mark said, it perfectly that we're not seeing a lot of pressure with items that are passed through to the customer. Mark Millett : And then one additional comment. I think we may have made this same comment in the last call. But as you reflect on our results, it's amazing to hire the teams throughout our organization just continue to break productivity records. And as such, over the years, we've found our conversion costs are actually incredibly stable or consistent given that the additional volume reduces our fixed cost, our overhead costs, which sort of absorbs any additional sort of inflationary pricing on alloys and those sorts of things. So through -- it's amazing, we just did the study, to be honest, with our Board last November. It's absolutely amazing, how our conversion costs remain very, very, very stable through the cycle. Andreas Bokkenheuser : So your performance-based structure is a good point. Thank you very much. I appreciate the insight. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Curt Woodworth at Credit Suisse. Your line is live. Curt Woodworth : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning Mark and Theresa. First question is just with regards to the Sinton ramp-up. I was wondering if you could help us understand the cadence of volume growth in the next couple of quarters and what level of start-up costs we should expect. And then you noted, I think, $1.8 million of on-site captive supply. When would you expect that to be fully functional? Mark Millett : Well, obviously, we are anticipating the final piece of the jigsaw to be put in place here in the next few days, if not the next week or so, so that the actual specific ramp over the next three months is difficult to predict. But we feel we should demonstrate our performance no less than others signing up the mills here in the last five, 10 years. So we would anticipate at least two million tons of shipments this year, reaching capacity -- essential capacity in the late third quarter or fourth -- probably fourth quarter. Curt Woodworth : Okay. And then in terms of the on-site supply, when would you expect that to be at that consumption rate? Mark Millett : Well, I think the -- it will come on in concert with our mill, in all honesty. We have one facility that's actually operating currently. There is one very large facility that will be operational in the next couple of months, but it's -- I'm not saying it was totally intentional. But by -- look, if nothing else, those facilities are going to ramp up nicely in concert with the steel mill. On the value-add side, we -- I think we've suggested in the past, the paint line, coating line is doing extremely well. The Galvalume capability comes online here, I think, in a couple of weeks. The finishing facilities performed extremely well. The hot strip mill is essentially commissioned. We bought slabs from third parties, and we also transferred intermediate slabs from our own facilities, took them that sort of preheated them in the tunnel furnace and have driven them through the mill quite successfully. So a lot of the parts are in great, great shape, but just waiting on the cash flow. Curt Woodworth : Okay. And then my follow-up is just maybe get a little bit more color on market dynamics last few months. I mean, it seems like between COVID, seasonality, destocking, rising supply, there's a lot of moving pieces here. And it seems like you're indicating that your January order book definitely strengthened relative to November and December. I think you had a comment that you said that inventories were normal, but some service centers saying they've got way too much, others don't. So I'm just curious, is your sense that the inventory level in the industry is generally getting rightsized pretty quickly at this point? And then in terms of the volume trends you saw in the fourth quarter, was it more concentrated on, say, the service center side of your business or on the OEM side? Thank you. Mark Millett : I think when I say inventories have normalized, I'm just going by history. I mean, it's quite simple, if you look at the last five or six years for sure, but you go back in time longer than that, levels are appropriate. And have they grown? Absolutely. So, they grew from an absolute historic low. And as I indicated, our belief is that they are appropriate for the sort of demand cycle that we're going through. The -- so a little bit of a lull, I do believe. And you've got to live through a few of these cycles in the past, and our team is fortunate to have that experience. But you hit COVID, the whole industry grown to a halt. Things started up much more rapidly. And there's chaos there, absolutely, in the industry, including ourselves, to some degree to catch up. And then when you catch up, what happens? Well, our industry is not perfect. And in general, it overshoots a little bit. And in November, December, you saw things catching up. And all of a sudden, people are getting their supply simultaneously from two to three mills. So, you get that little overshoot, which I think was seen in November to December. Those in the automotive space probably saw it more than most. And so you had that softness particularly in hot band. That will resolve itself. As I said earlier, we don't see any change in the underlying consumption of that steel. Currently, -- and nor do we see that happening over the months and quarters ahead. You just have a little kind of a spike of supply that came through given the seasonality. But again, we're incredibly optimistic for 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Carlos De Alba at Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Carlos De Alba : Yes, thank you very much. And just I guess following up on the last point. So, how should we reconcile then, Mark, that the fact that the lead-times in the industry, the information that is product available have continued to come down? But you -- as you said, you are extremely constructive on how your order book is looking like and demand expectations. Is it -- is this just a supply that you mentioned that picked up in recent months and is going to now be absorbed by demand, or is it Steel Dynamics is gaining market share versus competitors, and therefore, what you're seeing may be different to what the industry statistics that we have access to? Mark Millett : Well, I think we're certainly seeing market share in certain markets. We've certainly gained a dramatic traction in the automotive sphere, for instance. Unfortunately, that traction was with the automotive producers that weren't as impacted by the chip shortage is maybe the US domestic producers. So, yes, we are gaining sort of incremental market share there. Again, we have phenomenally sort of supportive loyal customers that in -- whether times like this, will support us and then bring their orders to us. Our overall business model, though, again, with a diverse product portfolio that we have, that we have differentiated supply chain solutions in our coated and prepaint business is just different, and it provides phenomenal value for the customer. And those businesses remain strong. And we think that the coated value-add market in general is going to remain very, very, very solid going forward. All you have is a little bit of seasonality, sort of, catch-up moment in hot band, which pressured spot price. If you can envision and I envision that the import volumes that picked up in the last three or four months because of a massive arbitrage growth, if you envision that, that can moderate, which I think is the arbitrage is shrinking. And as we listen to traders out there, having difficulty sustaining business for late second quarter of this year, if the imports do fall off a little, you're going to get demand pressure again. And it wouldn\u2019t be unexpected on our part if you saw a little rebound in pricing. Carlos De Alba : All right. Excellent. Thank you very much, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Gagliano at BMO Capital Markets. Your line is live, you may begin. David Gagliano : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll just ask a couple of quick ones here. Just on the commentary around 85% of flat roll lagged pricing in the fourth quarter. Can you just give us a sense so we can tighten up the models a little bit for first quarter? What was that average lag duration wise? And is that -- are those reasonable proxies for the first quarter as well? Theresa Wagler : Yes. The contract business, David, in the fourth quarter was at 80% to 85%, and it's likely to stay in that range at least through the first half of the year, as we're servicing our contract customers. And then, as Sinton comes online more strongly in the second half of the year, that's naturally going to decline to a certain degree, just because of the shift in mix. But we're expecting that to be maintained. As it relates to the lag, it's really about, on average, a two-month lag on the flat roll pricing, and it's generally tied to the CRU index. David Gagliano : Okay. And that's a reasonable proxy for the first quarter as well, two months lag? Theresa Wagler : Yes. Correct. David Gagliano : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then just last question for me. The CapEx, it went up a little bit, 700 prior guide to 750, what was the reason behind that? Theresa Wagler : Well, it is simply that we went through the extensive study that we do every year, and that generally takes place in the November time frame. So we proved additional projects and those projects, as kind of attested to by our return on invested capital metrics, are really efficiency and growth-oriented, but they're just smaller in nature. So there's nothing individually to call out for the reasons we increase. They're just some really nice projects came to light. David Gagliano : Okay. Perfect. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Theresa Wagler : You\u2019re welcome. Mark Millett : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Phil Gibbs at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is live. Phil Gibbs : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Hi, Theresa, can you provide the sheet shipments by product grade? Theresa Wagler : I apologize. I'm smiling because I did miss that. The hot mill and P&O shipments for the fourth quarter were 693,000 tons. Cold rolled was 136,000 tons. And finally, the coated products were 994,000 tons. Phil Gibbs : Perfect. And then I remember last quarter, you had -- and Mark, I think you had talked about yellow goods having a decent outlook, and we obviously know your feelings on automotive. What's the future look like in your opinion for SBQ this year and engineered bar? Mark Millett : I think for Engineered Bar is relatively steady. I think we'll gain some volume as automotive picks up is again 15%, 20% for auto with Engineered Bar, I do believe. So they're going to gain on the automotive side. They are going to lose a bit of volume, not much. As hot band has come off, folks are switching from seamless pipe over to ERW pipe. And so there was a little bit of volume there. For us, though, generally, that's going to benefit. We're already seeing the benefit then in Columbus, to be honest, as we're picking up energy orders there in one large mill \u2013 pipe mill is starting back up. Phil Gibbs : Can you talk about those dynamics a little bit more on the energy side in terms of the switch that it have to do with the trade case that was filed? Mark Millett : It's -- from our understanding, it's more just a cost issue, taking a slug -- Engineered Bar slug and piecing it and producing seamless pipe is more expensive today now that hot band has come off. And so people are switching to the ERW. Phil Gibbs : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Andrew Cosgrove at Bloomberg Intelligence. Your line is live. Andrew Cosgrove : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I know you said conversion costs have been kept in check and the team has done a pretty good job. I was just a little bit curious as to if you take the raw material spread and then the excess on top of that. It looks like it ticked up 10% to 15% quarter-on-quarter. I was just curious if that anything to do with having to buy more hot band because Sinton was not up and running and the finishing lines were or anything else that you could add on that particular front? Mark Millett : Great question. And yes, the conversion -- as I indicated earlier, the conversion costs under control is actually through our lines specifically. But as our conversion businesses -- and today, one has to remember, we're purchasing \u2013 1.7 million, 1.8 million tons of substring from others to support our -- the tax in Pittsburgh. We buy some third parties for our New Millennium fabrication business. You've got U.S. steel supply. You have Heartland facility. So yes, the added substrate or the substrate costs moving through does impact the perceived conversion. Andrew Cosgrove : Right. Okay. And then just lastly, could you just give us a little bit of an idea how much it costs to move things geographically, say from the Gulf up to the Midwest or from where you guys are situated at in the middle of the country to the western part? And then, I guess, along the same lines would be, are you still planning on sending 30% of Sinton's shipments to Mexico? Mark Millett : Well, several questions there, I guess, well several answers to give. From the Midwest \u2013 you mentioned Midwest, the West Coast, very little material moves from Midwest or East through the Rockies to the West Coast. It's quite an exorbitant freight rate. That's why one of the many advantages of Sinton is actually the freight rate, believe it or not, all the way to the West Coast to compete with the inflow market there. I think the freight rate there is $55 a ton or thereabouts. That the cheapest freight rate of any mill to the West Coast to sort of calibrate freights, Northern freight folks in Northern Indiana are shipping down to Mexico. And that's in the order of, I do believe, $95 to $110 a ton or as -- from Sinton into Mexico into Monterrey is going to be likely $37-ish a ton. So, the Sinton facility itself is a phenomenal sort of geographic advantage there to move that material into Mexico. And you're right, 30% or so, a million tons or thereabouts should flow into Mexico from the Sinton facility. Andrew Cosgrove : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Tumazos at John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is live. John Tumazos : Congratulations on all the customers on your campus at Sinton. With prime metals and the coating lines and then those customers, it's, I guess, close to 4 million tons of potential demand, do you expect to have the 6 more vacant lots for new customers filled? Does it make sense to build a second mill next to the first one if the demand is this good? Is it possible from an engineering standpoint to add another caster to increase the capacity at Sinton above 3 million tons given how much the customers seem to love it? Mark Millett : Well, John, your independent research is on target as always. So thank you, and thank you for the kind words on the team's performance because they did a phenomenal job last year. I would suggest that Sinton is jewel. The reception we've had there thus far for those six -- to come and be building even before the plant is running, I think, is testament to the vacuum of -- or the impact of the vacuum of steel primary steel production down then. So Sinton is a much needed asset for our industry, and it's definitely differentiated. The addition of a second caster likely is unlikely, but we have designed that facility to add somewhere between one million to 1.5 million tons of additional capacity. So expansion of that facility -- the capability is definitely there. I think we will also\u2026 John Tumazos : Mark, what is the limiting factor to the capacity of the plant? Is it the caster or the surrounding infrastructure? Mark Millett : The caster. The hot strip mill, like our other mills has the ability, given the -- width gauge combination that we can produce there, has 4.5 million tons of capacity. John Tumazos : Thank you. My son went on a Sinton tour in November. He joined the American AIST, American Iron Steel Technology Group, and he was telling me how great it was and sent me along his notes. So I'm not all that insightful, Mark. I learned from the younger generation. Mark Millett : Yeah. I know, John. I don't know how that happened, but we were glad that he was there, I guess. John Tumazos : \u2026leadership conference in September of AIST and six -- nine other trade associations in Pittsburgh and has his own friends and the engineering departments of all these steel companies now. Mark Millett : Yeah. Well, that's good. But no, thanks for your continued support of us, John. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is a follow-up from Timna Tanners. Your line is live. Timna Tanners : Hey, guys thanks for squeezing me in. I just think there's a lot of question about the fabricating business. And if you look historically the profitability in that division for EBITDA per ton has been pretty consistently $50 to $200 for -- just to give you a broad range, of course. Prices went up $1,000 a ton, EBITDA per ton exploded, and you say it's going to be sustained there. So just like to understand a little bit, is this a new normal in terms of earnings, is this out earning? What's driving that? Are customers not pushing back at all on the big increases in light of falling underlying steel prices? Just any further color would be really helpful. Mark Millett : Well, it depends on what time period you're calibrating to, Timna, I guess. That industry since last peak has changed and consolidated to large degree. And at the same time, currently, the actual market demand is at a historical high. Theresa Wagler : So Timna, the visibility that we have isn't predicated upon falling steel prices. Its predicated upon the forward pricing that we know we have in the order book for steel joist index. The team has done a really good job of managing the steel raw material inputs. So that's why we have more certainty. I would not say this is a new normal, no. This is an extraordinary time for them. But to Mark's point, we're gaining market share as well as the team has been doing some really interesting things on the operational side. We've added ship. Unique thing about our fabrication business is we can really achieve whatever volume demand will allow us to have just by adding people rather than adding assets, which is a very powerful tool. As we add volume, it really drops the bottom-line. And so that's why, again, we feel really confident about 2022 for the fabrication, but it shouldn't be our expectation that this is something that is the new normal. Operator : Thank you. Our final question for today is a follow-up from Seth Rosenfeld. Your line is live. Seth Rosenfeld : Thank you again for taking our questions. One final one of mine for shareholder returns. In the past, you've talked about the completion of Sinton as a potential catalyst to increase the base dividend. Can you talk us through the time line in terms of the de-risking of Sinton that you would want to secure before making that step? When we think about the scale of any potential increase, how do we consider that versus historical strategy? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : So, I think we mentioned it on the last quarter conference call as well as there is definitely the emphasis from the Board and from the senior leadership team to increase the dividend when we have through-cycle cash earnings that are increasing. And so that definitely is Sinton. We generally have our increases in the first quarter. I can't tell you what that will look like. I would expect to see it sometime in the first half of the year. But again, that's a Board decision to make. They're very supportive of this substantial increase. We have a target of a net income payout ratio of at least 35%. So, that's something that we'll take into consideration as we look at the through-cycle earnings for Sinton and what that dividend increase will look like. But in the meantime, we're using the share buyback program as a complement. That's something that we believe is very powerful for shareholder insurance as well. Operator : Thank you. That was our final question for today. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thanks Kate. Just quite simply, for those on the line for us, thank you for that support, for sure. Any customers, again, my heartfelt thanks to you. You make us who we are, in all honesty. And to our team, guys and girls, you absolutely shattered any previous performance by a long margin. And yes, the market helped, but what you do each and every day makes us different and proud to be part of you. But lastly, though, phenomenal performance from a volume and from a profitability standpoint. But we need to buckle down -- double back down on our safety and get that trend going back in that with the trajectory as we have in the past. But again, thank you, each and every one of you. Make it a great day. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

After management\u2019s remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Please be advised this call is being recorded today, April 21, 2022 and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on this call individually.

You will also find any reference to non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Record First Quarter 2022 Results. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. And as always, we appreciate and value your time with us this morning. Record results are of no importance if our teams did not remain safe. So before beginning this morning, I want to pause for a moment to acknowledge a recent workplace fatality that occurred at our Heartland Flat Roll division. We are deeply saddened, our thoughts and prayers reside with his family and friends. The reason I always begin our calls with a topic of safety is because it can never be overemphasized. Safety is our #1 value and first priority. Nothing is more important than sustaining a safe environment for our employees. We must all be continuously aware of our surroundings and our team members. We must actively think about safety at all times, keeping it top of mind, an active conversation. Simply, safety comes before everything. And with this backdrop, it's difficult to celebrate an otherwise phenomenal performance. But we're here this morning to share what the team accomplished in the first quarter and to congratulate them. Their record performance this quarter was another extraordinary achievement driven by the commitment, innovation and passion of our people, executing on our long-term strategies of diversified value-adding growth. I thank the whole team, the entire team for your dedication to excellence in every pursuit. We're committed to operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner and have been since our founding. We have always been and continue to be a leader in production of sustainable low-carbon emission steel products. We encourage the use of new technologies and processes to reduce our impact on the environment, including a strategic focus on carbon emissions mitigation with a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our sustainability strategy is an ongoing journey. We are starting from a leadership position within the industry and plan to stay there by doing even more. But before I continue with more market commentary, Theresa will share insights into our performance. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. It's exciting to continue to see all the new milestones being continually reached throughout the company. A personal thanks to our teams and congratulations. Your performance resulted in another record quarter for Steel Dynamics with net income of $1.1 billion or $5.71 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2022. In the quarter, we incurred cost of $84 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the continued commissioning start-up of our Sinton Texas Flat Roll Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, first quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.2 billion or $6.02 per diluted share. First quarter 2022 record revenues of $5.6 billion and record operating income of $1.5 billion were both 5% higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by higher realized selling values in our steel fabrication business and continued strong performance in our steel and metals recycling operations. We also achieved record quarterly cash flow from operations of $819 billion [ph] and adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion, a truly exceptional performance. We see positive industry fundamentals for at least the remainder of 2022 and believe our second quarter 2022 results could achieve yet another new record performance. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, achieving record shipments of 2.9 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 50,000 tons. Earnings from our steel operations were 15% lower than sequential record fourth quarter results related to metal spread compression and our flat-roll steel operations as realized pricing declined more than raw material costs. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion based on rising product prices. Despite hitting record volumes, we still have additional steel shipping capacity, much of which is within the long product steel group. When Sinton is fully operational, it will contribute an additional 750,000 tons per quarter of availability. Operating income from our mills recycling operations for the first quarter were strong at $48 million, based on improved metal margins as both average ferrous and nonferrous pricing improved in the quarter. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide raw material working capital requirements. Mark will expand on the meaningful benefit of our steel and metals recycling teams working together to reduce our cost of raw materials as well. A huge congratulations to our steel fabrication team. They almost doubled their previous record results, achieving a new record high quarterly operating income of $467 million, eclipsing the entire full year of 2021 results by almost 30% in just one quarter. These earnings were driven by record pricing supported by near-record shipments of 210,000 tons. Steel joist and deck order activity remains incredibly strong. Our steel fabrication business continues to operate with a record backlog considering both forward product pricing and volumes which currently extends through the first quarter of 2023. Based on this strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model. At the end of March, we had liquidity of $2.4 billion comprised of cash of $1.2 billion and our fully undrawn unsecured revolver. During the first quarter of 2022, we generated record cash flow from operations of $819 million. Working capital grew $757 million due to higher customer account values stemming from higher prices and volume, coupled with the payment of our 2021 company-wide profit sharing of $360 million. We also funded $159 million in organic capital investments. We believe full year 2022 capital investments will approximate $750 million the majority of which relate to our four new flat-rolled value-added coating lines to be located in Sinton and Heartland. We also finalized the purchase of 45% of the equity interest in New Process Steel on February 1. We increased our first quarter cash dividend by 31% to $0.34 per common share based on the additional ongoing through-cycle free cash flow expected from our new Sinton steel mill. We repurchased 390 -- excuse me, we repurchased $389 million of our common stock in the first quarter, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. As we exhausted our previous program, we also announced the Board's approval on an additional $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization, further demonstrating our confidence in Steel Dynamics future cash flow generation. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 143% and we've repurchased $2.7 billion of our common stock, representing 27% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizing strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while also dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of that long-term value creation strategy and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. Further committing to this path, in 2021, we announced greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy goals, including a goal for our steel mills to be carbon neutral by 2050. To increase transparency and accountability, we've also set interim milestones for 2025 and 2030. We had led the steel industry with our exclusive use of electric arc core steelmaking technology, our circular manufacturing model and our innovative solutions. We plan to sustain our leadership position by executing our carbon reduction goals through among other avenues, investing in emission reduction projects, increasing the use of renewable energy and developing and supporting new innovative technology. As an example, we're incredibly excited to recently invest $25 million in the equity of Aymium. Aymium is a producer of renewable biocarbon products that replace fossil fuels and reduce emissions in large global industries, including new electric arc furnace steel industry. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than most of our peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving towards the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. For those of you that like to track our detailed flat roll shipments for the quarter, hot rolled and Pickled and Oiled shipments were 736,000 tons, cold-rolled shipments were 162,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,065,000 tons. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations executed another exceptional record quarter. The earnings power of this platform in this environment still has not been completely displayed as customer demand and pricing continue to be strong. Our steel joist and deck order backlog remain at record volume and forward pricing levels, extending well into the first quarter of '23. The nonresidential construction market remains solid, considering the trend we have seen over the last year, especially in areas that support online retail, specifically represented by construction of distribution and warehouse facilities, along with data centers, schools and health care. Our steel fabrication operations provide a significant natural hedge to our steel production operations in a stable or moderating steel price environment. They also support our steel mills during periods of weaker steel demand as a ready internal customer, what we call pull-through volume, increasing the through-cycle utilization of our steel mills. We have steel fabrication facilities located throughout the U.S. and in Mexico, providing us with an advantaged broad-based customer-centric supply chain. As I move into metals recycling, I'll just take a moment to thank Russ Rinn given his impending retirement in July for the truly significant contributions he's made to that platform over his 10 years, 11-year tenure. He's helped transform that business. Today, we're operating at the same volumes with 1,500 less teammates. So the consolidation there and rationalization has been excellent. And I got massive faith in Miguel Alvarez, who now is leading that platform. I've got great faith that he's going to continue that transformation and do great things with that business. So Russ, my sincere thanks mate. Our metals recycling operations also performed well in the quarter with steady operating income of $48 million. As one of the largest ferrous and nonferrous metal recyclers in North America with operations throughout the U.S. and Mexico, we have a competitive advantage in providing the highest quality, cost-effective scrap to our EAF-based steel mills and to our other customers. In today's environment, our advantage of having our metals recycling platform is even greater. During the last 18 months, our recycling and steel teams have worked closely in developing a higher-quality shredded scrap that can be used in place of prime scrap. The combined effort resulted in our Butler Flat Roll Steel division, reducing its need for prime scrap from 65% of its mix to only 40%, while achieving the same steel qualities. We are currently rolling this out to our Columbus and Sinton Steel divisions, allowing for a lower cost, readily available, low-residual scrap supply. Additionally, given the historically high spread between prime and obsolete grades which is around $170 a ton today, the reduced prime scrap requirement has provided a significant cost savings. The teams are also working together as global pig iron supply chains have been disrupted with the advent of the invasion of Ukraine. Our flat-roll steel operations have reduced the demand of pig iron usage while maintaining the highest level of steel quality through changes in our operating practices and the health of our metals recycling team and sourcing alternative inputs. We have sufficient resources for our steel production to continue operating uninterrupted. Additionally, of particular note, our Butler Flat Roll division has the advantage of iron dynamics, an on-site liquid pig iron production facility that supplies almost all of Butler's pig iron requirements. Charging liquid pig iron into the electric hot furnace also significantly increases productivity and reduces melting costs. We developed the technology years ago and it's the only existing facility of its kind today. We are currently in the process of pursuing opportunities to become even more pig iron self-sufficient for the future. The steel team had an outstanding quarter as well, achieving record shipments and operating income of $1.2 billion. During the quarter, the domestic steel industry operated at production utilization rate of 80%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93%. We consistently operated at higher utilization due to our value-added product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and to support our internal manufacturing businesses. hot roll coil pricing moderated during the early part of the first quarter but prices have recently firmed with extending order lead times across the product set, especially in coated products. With continued strong demand, we believe steel prices will remain strong. Based on higher raw material input costs, global flat-rolled steel supply disruptions related to the Ukraine, Russia conflict and lower steel imports. Throughout our company history, we have intentionally grown our value-added steel product portfolio and created valuable customer supply chain solutions to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, at least 70% of our steel sales are considered value-added. This differentiated business model will continue to provide best-in-class financial metrics and through cycle cash generation. Looking forward, we remain optimistic. The automotive sector steel consumption is expected to grow with production through 2024 returning to over 17 million units supported by an extreme lack of automotive dealer inventory and strong pent up demand. The nonresidential construction sector is strong as evidenced by the strength of our customer backlogs within our long product steel group. Our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions both achieved record quarterly earnings and our Engineered Bar Products division is operating at historically strong volumes. And additionally, as we discussed steel fabrication operations are operating at never seen before levels. Residential construction is also good, resulting in high demand for HVAC appliance and other related products. Strong energy prices continue to push up the rig count and we have seen solid demand for energy products. In aggregate, our steel order backlogs and order input strength coupled with broad optimistic customer commentary and general market momentum drive us to conclude that steel market dynamics will remain strong throughout 2022. Steel Dynamics is a dynamic growth company, increasing through-cycle earnings and cash flow to support continuous long-term value creation. Our most recent and significant investment represented by a new state-of-the-art electric arc furnace flat roll steel mill located in Sinton, Texas. This differentiated strategic investment facilitates significant through-cycle operational and financial growth for our teams and customers and for our vendors and shareholders. This electric arc furnace steel mill represents next-generation lower carbonate emitting steel production capabilities, providing differentiated products and supply chain solutions. The 3 million tons state-of-the-art facility is designed to have product capabilities beyond that of any existing electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel producer, competing even more effectively with higher carbon-emitting integrated steel facilities and high carbon foreign competition. It provides us with a more diverse value-added steel product portfolio and benefits our customers with an even broader climate conscious supply option. Sinton's strategic location is centralized in our underserved steel consumer region that represents over 27 million tons of relevant flat roll steel consumption in the U.S. and Mexico. We offer shorter delivery lead times, providing a superior customer supply chain solution for the region. We will also effectively compete with steel imports arriving in Houston and the West Coast. We have seven customers locating on our site, representing up to 1.8 million tons of annual flat-rolled steel processing and consumption capability, four are already operating and the other two have broken ground -- three have broken ground actually. This represents a unique closed loop process as we provide them on-site steel and simultaneously reclaiming the scrap to be remelted into new steel products. We have an advantaged raw material procurement strategy for Sinton. Our acquisition of a Mexican metals recycling company in 2020 provides a critical source of prime scrap supply. These operations are strategically located near high-volume industrial scrap sources throughout Central and Northern Mexico. Sinton provides a differentiated product offering, a unique regional supply chain solution, with significant geographic freight and lead time advantage and offers a lower carbon alternative to imports in a region in need of options. We currently expect 2022 shipments from Sinton to be over 1.5 million tons achieving utilization of approximately 80% by the end of the third quarter and over 90% before year-end. In addition, our previously announced additional four value-added flat roll coating lines are still on schedule to begin operating mid-'23 in support of our Sinton steel mill and our Heartland flat roll operations. The four lines are comprised of two new paint lines and two new galvanizing lines with Galvalume coating capability. Our unique value-added coating supply chain strategy has resulted in our existing lines consistently running at or near full capacity. Existing customers are anxiously awaiting the volume from these new lines. We're the largest domestic non-automated coater of flat roll steels with an annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. And these four lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. In closing, our sustainable symbiotic operating platforms and customer-centric supply solutions demonstrate our financial and operating stability differentiating from any competition. We're not the same company that we were nearly five years ago. We are not just a steel company. Our average annual free cash flow has more than doubled and is still growing. The consistency and industrial strength of our earnings is clear and we are investing for transformational growth. Our people and their spirit of excellence provides the foundation for this success. And I thank you, each and every one of you for your passion and dedication and remind you that safety is always our most critical priority. So everyone, thank you for joining us today and we'll open the line-up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily Chieng : My first question is just around your raw material update there. Can you remind us what the raw material mix is or was previously before the shift to using more obsolete versus prime scrap. The amount of IDI that your liquid pig iron that you're using and perhaps how we should see that changing over time? Mark Millett : Well, IDI is consistently running at about a 260,000 ton rate as we speak. It's been very, very consistent for many years now. And after the original pioneering efforts or challenges that we had many, many years ago, is an absolutely solid, solid, solid technology for us. And again, as I mentioned, virtually all our pig iron needs that Butler is captive from that facility. Theresa Wagler : Emily, one way to look at it from the shift that Mark talked about from going to -- from prime scrap to an upgraded type of obsolete scrap all the way from 65% to 40%. So if that were able to be accomplished with Columbus, Sinton and Butler, if you just make high-level assumptions that generally we would use approximately 20% of pig iron. And then the rest would be more geared toward that prime scrap. If you think about that from a volume perspective, it could be as much as 1.5 million to 2 million tons shifting from prime scrap to higher grade. So if you apply any spread to that. Today, I think Mark mentioned it's like around $170 per ton which is higher than normal. Even if it's $100, $150 per ton, that could be a significant change once -- if all three mills are fully operational. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Michael Glick : Just on the cost side, beyond scrap, how should we think about energy costs more broadly, just given some of the recent moves we've seen in several of the regional power hubs and natural gas prices as well? Theresa Wagler : Just as a reminder, from a natural gas perspective, for electric arc furnaces for Steel Dynamics specifically, it isn't a huge part of the cost structure. It ends up being somewhere around 2% or 3% of the cost of manufacturing of steel products. But obviously, there's impact. We're likely to see increasing prices across the spectrum from a natural gas perspective but nothing that we believe is necessarily significantly impractical. And from a power perspective across the spectrum, we're operating in all different grades. And so it's very different. In some areas, we're in the open market and others, we actually have contracts in place. So there should be some escalating prices but nothing that we think will be material at this point. Mark Millett : And just to add, if you look at it from a global perspective, obviously, energy prices in other parts of the world have appreciated far greater than the U.S., along with other commodity pricing issues. And so the actual global cost curve has risen and should support pricing further. And obviously, given our low-cost position advantages Steel Dynamics. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : I just wanted to ask a little more about the fabrication business, unbelievable how much this has exploded higher over the last year, I know it's directionally not new but again, another doubling in basically the profit contribution this quarter which is fabulous. But it's -- there's a lot of moving parts embedded in that business. And mind me, the visibility towards longer term is still fairly low. So I'm just trying to see if you could give us a little more information on that segment. Can you talk more about how this business is priced? Are there cost pass-throughs? Are there lags between those pass-throughs and contract prices? I know there's a lot of different pieces within that business. But if there's any more visibility, I really appreciate it. And it really just to summarize, if you could just give us what you think your view is on a normalized go-forward EBITDA contribution basis from this business beyond the first quarter of 2023. Mark Millett : Several points, somewhat collected maybe. But firstly, demand is at historic highs. If you follow the American Joist Institute numbers, it's at peak, peak levels for sure. And it is driven largely by the change in retail, going online retail distribution houses along with the data centers. So that arena is truly pushing massive demand. Secondly, I think it needs to be recognized that the industry since prior peaks has changed dramatically. It's a rationalized, consolidated industry today. And that allows -- it's just a change dynamic that allows us to have, I think, greater pricing strength. And as a realization today, the value of the product is a lot higher than people would suggest in past history, that product is going to sell at higher levels going forward no matter where we are in the cycle. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, David. Just a couple of other points to add to what Mark described. So if you're looking at a backlog for the fabrication business versus the steel business, it's very different. So once a project enters the backlog in our fabrication business, the entire project has been highly engineered and is part of a bigger construction project overall. And if you look at the steel costs that are involved in these large projects that we're participating in, it's really not a large percentage of the entire project. So the customer base, if you will, is not as sensitive to steel pricing as one would think. I mean I think you saw that in the first quarter where even though flat rolled steel prices had a couple of months of weakening that didn't change at all what we were putting in the order backlog at our fabrication business. And so that's one thing. The second thing is because our backlog is out much longer than it typically is, we typically would see a backlog of maybe four to six months. Now it's out and that would be a very good backlog. I mean now we're out into -- well into 2023. And so we changed some of the contract terms as well to try to ensure there's more security and what I would say is more visibility and certainty around the backlog. So we believe that we have a great deal of visibility. We know where we're pricing today and Mark mentioned in his notes that, that forward pricing is higher than what we even realized at this point in time. And that's why I had the confidence in my notes to say that we expect earnings from the fabrication business to continue to increase throughout 2022. And so, I'm not sure if there's no specific you asked about pass-throughs of costs, specific surcharges, etcetera, like you might see in some of the steel businesses in fabrication. But all of that, once it hits the backlog, it's already guaranteed from a price perspective. So I'll just pause on that and see if Mark and I have addressed your question. David Gagliano : Yes. That's absolutely helpful. Just again, I'm trying to gauge what the comfort level is around a normalized -- the EBITDA contribution now is 20x what it was historic average for well over five years and that 20x increase happened in four quarters. So I'm just trying to figure out as we go out beyond 2022 and in 1Q '23. Some of this is structural and some of it is not, I'm trying to figure out what you think a normal sort of contribution should be for a business that's relatively low visibility from my perspective. Theresa Wagler : Sure, David. I would tell you that -- and I can't answer you specifically at this point but what I would tell you is that it's certainly not what the last five years were because Mark pointed to some structural changes within the industry itself from consolidation and other avenues as well as the construction market itself and what it's doing. So there has been some structural change which I think will make that normalized earnings moving forward are higher than we've seen historically as well as what we've done internally. The fabrication team has really done an incredible job. And I know that you've been to some of our operations and we're looking to further automate and to do some really exciting things in the future as well. But also not what we're experiencing today from a normalized level. There are some specific things that happened and with extended steel prices with a very strong construction market, we think that market will continue. I mean specific to there's a large concentration in warehouses at this point. but we will do our best in the future to try to give you a little better idea of what normalized might look like. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld with BNP. Seth Rosenfeld : I have two follow-ups, please with regards to the raw material strategy. First, thanks for the color on your efforts to cut your reliance on prime scrap and pig iron. Can you just talk a bit more about those markets and the outlook into spring, so you had a huge squeeze in March. Are you now seeing any signs of some softening of those markets as availability improves? And a follow-up, please, you commented quickly in your prepared remarks with regards to some interest in becoming more self-sufficient for pig iron. What might that include? Is it going to be organic or inorganic in nature. I'll stop there, please. Mark Millett : Well, firstly, on the pig iron opportunities I prefer not to go into that. Just suffice it to say that we have plans. Relative to -- and I apologize, I didn't necessarily hear all the first question. Theresa Wagler : Mark, the question Seth asked relates to pricing around raw materials and what we're seeing kind of in the near term and longer term for scrap and maybe for pig iron? Mark Millett : Well, obviously, the unimaginable human tragedy of U.K. -- of Ukraine, sorry, should be at the forefront of everyone's mind but the consequences of that on our industry has obviously been massive and I think just on commodities in general, all commodities. If you look at pig iron, the typical global trade is around about 12 million tons merchant trade, roughly 7 million, maybe 8 million tons of that were originating from Russia and Ukrainian mills. So there's been a big chunk of availability or supply taken out. We -- I can't speak really for other metals but I think they followed suit that we scrambled as an industry to cover our needs for the rest of the year into 2023 from other sources, we were very, very successful in procuring material from Brazil and from India in particular and at the same time, changing our sort of operations and process to lower the need or the requirement of that pig iron. So typically, where a mill is around about 22% pig iron input, our mills today are running around about 14%. So in combination, that's got us into 2023 from an uninterrupted supply. Consequence of all that, though, obviously, pushed pig iron pricing up, it peaked at around about $1,100 a ton. And that drew particularly if we prime scrap up with it, prime scrap today is around $75-ish I guess. Pig iron there is turned over. Transactions are in the kind of the very low $900 range today. And we foresee that pressuring scrap pricing down, at least sideways but more likely pressuring it down going forward into the summer. On the flip side, on the obsolete side, when you have pricing at these levels. And as Theresa suggested, there's a record spread between obsolete shred grades to prime of around about $170 a ton. Historically, that was only about $40 a ton. So at these trading levels, everyone is out there with their pickup trucks picking up old cars and old refrigerators. And so the obsolete stream is considerable today. Flow is very, very, very high and we feel that is going to pressure scrap pricing over the next few months as well. Seth Rosenfeld : If I can have just one follow-up, please. Within your recycling business noticed that the fair shipments were down year-over-year quite considerably. Can you touch on what's driving that decrease and how you'd expect it to transpire into Q2. Theresa Wagler : So from a fairs perspective, the shipments were down in the first quarter. It wasn't structural per se. It had to do with where raw material inventories were at the end of the year, heading into the first quarter. There were some mill outages during the first quarter as well. Heading forward is when traditionally, you're going to see seasonality kick in and based on where we see steel demand and how that translates then into raw material demand as well, we would expect to see increasing volumes second and third quarter for mill recycling. Operator : Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : So first, I just wanted to just get a little bit more color on the new guidance for Sinton starting up. I think now 1.5 million and it was previously 2 million. Is it possible? There's just further delays. Can you give us a little more color on that and what's happened there? Mark Millett : Sure. Absolutely. And I would say and just to emphasize the progress at Sinton is remarkable. The reduced volume and I think we gave that in our January call was still a little higher than that. And that was before the hot side of the caster and the caster that was delayed. Just to start up itself. But since then, the mill is running extremely well as we commission all the different sort of bells and whistles and commission our capabilities. So we've already been at 84.6 inch width coil. We've already been down to 0.60 on high-strength low alloy grades -- and the hot band itself is -- it was described to me this morning as from our customers as beautiful. So I think it's going well, to be honest and confident that we will exceed that 1.5 million tons in all honesty, we're just being conservative perhaps. I would say, that we just had our national sales, flat roll sales, meaning at Sinton for the last two weeks -- last two days, sorry. And the tenor there is that the customer interest is absolutely off the charts. As I said, it's such an underserved marketplace today and the product differentiation of that facility is going to be insane. And the fact that we have the selling facilities, four of which are already operating will be a massive sort of pull-through sort of volume for that facility. So we couldn't be -- to be honest, we couldn't be happier. Yes, what could... Timna Tanners : So 90% of the... Mark Millett : Last December. Yes. But the good side and I think it was -- I can't remember which one have you suggested but a slow ramp isn't all that bad from a supply-demand dynamic right now anyway. And we -- if you consider our ramp-up is going to be solid through the rest of this year and we went to 24, five operation, just this Monday. Up into that point, we would just commissioning sort of 12 hours a day on days. Galvalume steel, obviously, is not ramping up yet and delta is not. So net-net, it's a good thing. Timna Tanners : Got you. So David and I have said that we're going to start a fab shop. I'm joking, obviously. But we would -- I did want to ask you how hard it would be to see any competitors there in that space, right? Given that prices are now higher than $4,000 a ton. And historically, I calculated $1350. I mean even with the higher costs, those are pretty nice margins. So I know you said it's consolidated but -- how hard would it be to see a new entrant there? And how much of that could be a risk. Mark Millett : The cost of entry from an asset perspective is not massive. As we've seen or as we described in our last call, we substantially increased productivity and volume capability from our facilities there with almost no capital expense because simply, it's people alliance more than actual capital asset. The engineering of that product is intense to engineer cost effectively is a -- it's proprietary kind of intellectual sort of evolution of many, many, many years. For someone who jumped in fresh nothing is impossible. There's absolutely no way they could emulate our productivity and our efficiency and they wouldn't be able to penetrate in my mind, the marketplace. Theresa Wagler : Just to add to what Mark is saying, if you think about it, you have to have the architecture and the firms the customers are willing to design at some extent, for your products, etcetera. So it's not something that someone can just get involved and have all the constituents know you right off the bat, Mark said that incredibly well. Mark Millett : One last thing I would add also is to create the cultural -- the culture for those facilities is absolutely phenomenal. Team does incredibly well. And if you were to visit a joist plant, it's almost a choreography of action and activity and it's very, very difficult to replicate. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Just a couple of questions. The first one, are there -- could you talk about any potential additional cost in this enhanced shredded-scrap products that you are now creating and charging your mills with other than the spread which obviously is a big incentive for you to move down to shredded. Are there any costs that you incurred or maybe we should take into consideration just besides the spread and the cost of shredded scrap? And then my second question, if I can is, could you remind us or provide us an updated CapEx guidance for this year? And in particular, is there any changes on the CapEx for Sinton given there's lower ramp-up and the delay on the caster? Mark Millett : Well, I'll take the scrap one and essentially call us, I'd say, somewhere around $10 a ton. Theresa Wagler : That was very short response. From the perspective of guidance for CapEx for this year, we're still tracking around $750 million and your question was specific to Sinton. And specific to it, we don't expect anything of significance for digital CapEx related to the delays, there was additional expense which you saw flow through the first quarter already due to the delay in just manpower and maintenance of things associated with that delay but not from a capital perspective. So for Sinton we're still at that $2 billion mark which honestly is incredible, given what the teams have gone through for them to be able to maintain their budget while being able to make it through COVID and whatnot and everything else. So we're not expecting anything for the rest of the year in addition from a Sinton perspective for capital. Operator : Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : Mark, with respect to the 1.8 million tons on site that -- I know you said four operating, three under construction but when would you expect that to be fully operational. And then also, when you look at that sort of localized manufacturing capability, do you have a sense of if -- how much of that would be a potential onshoring capability, i.e., sort of new demand or are those facilities replacing, say, existing sites within North America? That's my first question. Mark Millett : Well, I guess the on-campus sort of development is firstly evolved much quicker than we anticipated. It's been absolutely incredible to see the faith of our customer base and coming to and investing in our sort of dream down there. And secondly, as I said, when I say intentional, we wanted to make sure is that we differentiated our supply chains. And each of those on-site customers per se are in a different field. So we have everything covered from automotive to light-gauge coated to heavy gauge plate cuts and everything. We have a pipe producer there and we have a couple of pipe producers there actually. So it's a good spread, a good array of activity to support our supply chain to customers. And obviously, it's a huge benefit to them. We're able to firstly deliver that material to them free of charge. It's just 200 -- well, not smaller than 200 yards. It's a big site. But a mile down the track, we can deliver it very, very effectively at low cost. If you see and stand beside one of our coils there, it is absolutely remarkable, the difference in size between a 22-ton coil and a 52-ton coil. That's giving those customers massive operational benefits, yield benefits. And so that's a plot. And it also, obviously, just the elimination of that first freight is $25, $30, $35 a ton savings in the supply chain. So we see it as a very, very effective solution. It's going to allow us to penetrate markets much, much quicker. Theresa Wagler : And Curt, in addition to what Mark said and we're getting a lot of excitement from this from customers of those customers that are on site is that it removes a considerable amount as the greenhouse gas is associated with delivery and movement of material and we'll be able to take their scrap as well. So it's almost a perfect closed-loop environment that heretofore really hasn't been available. So it will be interesting to see how that develops from a marketing perspective as well. Curt Woodworth : Okay. And then with respect to Iron Dynamics, I mean it seems like that facility has really become a viable asset to the company. I know in the past, had some issues. Are you evaluating potentially building another facility like that at some point? I know in your prepared remarks, you said you were evaluating potential further investment into pig iron. Just curious kind of how you could see the evolution of that going forward? Mark Millett : I prefer not to reveal our strategy on pig iron supply right now. But I appreciate the question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We do have a follow-up question coming from Seth Rosenfeld. Seth Rosenfeld : Just one more with regards to working capital, please. Obviously, very significant investments in Q1 weighing on free cash flow. Can you give a bit more color on the split, perhaps, how much of that was tied to strength in steel prices and volumes versus growth in raw materials inventories, perhaps there was a need to build particularly elevated inventories of raw mats given supply chain disruption. And then, looking forward into Q2 or into the back half what should we think about the sequencing of working capital investment potential release as Sinton begins to then ramp up. Theresa Wagler : Fairly fast. From the second, working capital. One big draw which I'll just reiterate, even though I had it in my opening comments is that we do pay our company-wide profit sharing in March of every year -- the following year. So there was a $360 million payment to the profit sharing which we're fairly excited to be able to provide that for the retirement of our teams. It's based, as you know, on 8% of pretax earnings. And -- so that was a big part of the lever. The other piece of it really related to fabrication and customer account values and volumes. And it was really less to do with inventory. So inventory was fairly flat. Specifically as it relates to Sinton, Sinton isn't in a building working capital mode. So it increases working capital in the first quarter, somewhere around $150 million to $200 million. You'll see that continue. It might be another $100 million to $150 million in the second quarter and third quarter combined. And then we should really be reaching that capacity point outside of any big movements in inventory valuation itself or in customer evaluations themselves for Sinton. From a consolidated perspective, moving throughout the year, again, we're heading into a seasonally strong environment, second and third quarter. I don't -- you're not going to see as big of a build as we saw in the first quarter because you don't have the same movement in payables and accruals. So I would say it's going to be muted, then likely you'll see some working capital give back in third and fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : I got dropped off the call for a little bit, so I apologize if this was asked. And I also appreciate if you're going to give me the same answer that you just gave Curt. But you've talked about scrap and pig, how does DRI, HBI potentially fit into your raw material strategy. Mark Millett : We currently are purchasing, procuring DRI -- well, not DRI, HBI and have been for many years. For us, it tends to be what we call a value and use kind of economic calculation if it makes financial sense to put it in the mix, then we will buy it. HBI tends to be an inferior product for the electric arc furnace. It's slows productivity there. It's low yield increases energy consumption. So it's never a preferred material. But at the right price, it makes sense. And so we do have a small but kind of steady diet to keep in line with that supply chain. Our furnace is actually at Sinton and we're converting Columbus to sort of in-line charging which allows higher volumes of HBI to be added to the furnace if need be. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, again, we certainly appreciate your time. And hopefully and I see some are just recognizing the strength of our business model, the vertical integration, the downstream supply chain solutions that we have, the diversified value-add mix that we have and now Sinton coming online and another four lines soon thereafter. But we truly, in my humble opinion, we and the team has truly transformed this company over the last five, six years. We're a different company today. We're not just a steel company. And I see that some of you are recognizing that and I think with time. And as my mom always used to say, proof is in the pudding. Well, we're making the pudding, we're proving it and I can't be prouder of the team. They're a phenomenal team. I ask them to be safe each and every day and looking after each other. Thank you for the customers, for your faith and support and for our vendors, particularly the vendors that have gone far and beyond the call of duty, so to speak, in putting Sinton together. They've done a phenomenal job. So thank you. and thank you to our shareholders who support us. So with that said, thank you and have a safe and wonderful day. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

After management\u2019s remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Please be advised this call is being recorded today, July 21, 2022, and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today\u2019s call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today\u2019s statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov and, if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Record Second Quarter 2022 Results. Now I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, David. Thank you, everyone, for being with us on our second call this week. It\u2019s been \u2013 it was exciting to announce our new growth initiative on Tuesday with our entry into the aluminum market. And it\u2019s only been, I think, probably 48 hours or so, and the customer response from all three market segments, whether it be distribution processes, whether it be the packaging industry or even automotive, it\u2019s been absolutely staggering the early sign of affirmation of us getting into the marketplace, and I think speaks to the lack of supply and optionality within that market. So that\u2019s exciting. And it\u2019s as exciting and even more exciting to announce yet another record quarter, record consolidated volumes, earnings per share, cash flow, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to build shareholder value. Specifically, we repurchased $517 million worth of the company\u2019s common stock, representing 3.5% of our outstanding shares in the quarter. So we were staying true to our repurchase programs. We are certainly beneficiary of a strong market tailwind but I\u2019m incredibly proud of our 11,000 strong team. They are the foundation and the catalyst of our success. They are the ones driving the superior results. It\u2019s their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last 10 years that allows us to exploit the current market and will continue to produce higher lows and higher highs through the cycle. I\u2019ve said it many times before, but none of this matters without keeping everyone safe. Often, employees are described as a company\u2019s most important asset. For us, they are more than that. They\u2019re part of the SDI family, the people, and we are always striving to provide the best for their health, their safety and for their welfare. We\u2019re actively focused on safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level within the organization. We\u2019re certainly better than industry averages, but we\u2019re not going to rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero incidents. We\u2019re continuing to see material market share gains driven by our ESG profile, an industry-leading low carbon footprint for flat rolled products. We will continue our journey to environmental excellence through a defined and achievable plan to be carbon neutral by 2050. Our recent Aymium investment and our joint venture is a perfect example of that. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through renewable biomass replacing fossil fuels in our electric arc furnaces. We have tested the product and it works beautifully. We believe it will also work within our iron operations. Initially, it will be 160,000 metric tons per year, and the CapEx is estimated to be around $125 million to $150 million. It will reduce our Scope 1 steelmaking greenhouse gas intensity by some 20%, 25% with even further potential upside from the use of the biogas. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to give us some thoughts? Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As Mark said, what an incredible week. We announced our aluminum strategy on Tuesday, and now we\u2019re sharing our record results. I can see personal things relate to the entire SDI family. Your performance resulted in record sales, earnings and cash flow, a truly exceptional performance. Our second quarter 2022 net income was $1.2 billion, or $6.44 per diluted share, inclusive of cost of $77 million, or $0.29 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas Flat Rolled Steel Mill. Excluding these costs, second quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $1.3 billion, or $6.73 per diluted share. Revenues improved across all of our platforms to a record $6.2 billion, driven by record steel shipments and record pricing volume in our steel fabrication business. Our second quarter 2022 record operating income of $1.6 billion improved 8% versus first quarter results, driven by record steel fabrication earnings. Our steel operations generated very strong operating income of $1.1 billion in the second quarter with record shipments of 3.1 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 171,000 tons. Sequential earnings were 5% lower due to metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations as realized pricing declined and average scrap costs increased. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion resulting from rising product prices. In fact, we set quarterly record shipments at our Structural Engineer Bar and Roanoke Bar divisions. Second quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations remained strong at $58 million, representing a 20% sequential quarterly improvement as ferrous metal margin and volume improved. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and mills recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record second quarter operating income of $599 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, coupled with record shipments. Steel joist and deck demand remains strong as evidenced by the continued strength in our order backlog, which remains at near record levels and contain strong forward pricing. Based on the strength, we expect steel fabrication earnings to continue to increase even further as the year progresses. Our cash generation continues to be consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At the end of June, we had record liquidity of $2.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.3 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1 billion in the second quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date. During the first half of 2022, we have funded $323 million in capital investments. For the second half of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be approximately $350 million to $400 million, the majority of which relate to our four new flat roll coating lines be located in Sinton and Heartland. We maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing it 31% in the first quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased $906 million or 6.5% of our outstanding shares. At the end of the second quarter, $727 million remained available under our most recent share repurchase authorization. Since 2017, we\u2019ve increased our cash dividend per share by 143%, and we have repurchased $3.2 billion of our common stock, representing 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with the shareholder distributions comprised of a positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while also dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged strategy. As I mentioned on Tuesday\u2019s call, our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. We will readily fund this investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions. We\u2019ve strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth, strong shareholder returns, and maintain investment grade metrics. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is a part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We\u2019re committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, as Mark mentioned, we\u2019re very excited to \u2013 that we formed our joint venture with Aymium recently, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. Steel Dynamics owns 55% of the joint venture, and we\u2019re the operating partner. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. As you saw, absolutely incredible results from the New Millennium fabrication platform, record operating income of $599 million in Q2 on record 218,000 tons of shipments. We see the nonresidential construction markets remaining strong. Despite the caution emanating from Amazon\u2019s message for next year, we have had reaffirmation from our major customers anyway, including warehouse customers that everything remains incredibly strong going forward into 2023. Cloud-based computing, data centers, pharma and schools are all strong. Although the ABI index may have drifted slightly month-over-month, the AI reports, ongoing order activity and architectural firms as well as new work online remains very strong. For us, order input activity remains robust, and we still have near-peak backlog persisting. So that\u2019s a very, very good position to be in. Q3 earnings from fabrication will certainly increase. We\u2019re going to see increased shipments and metal spread expansion from both increased selling values and lower steel input costs. And as you\u2019ve seen, this is a \u2013 it\u2019s providing a perfect hedge to softening steel prices. Although we mentioned his impending retirement on our Q1 call, Russ Rinn had his final official day in the office last week after about 11 years of dedicated commitment to SDI and the OmniSource recycling platform. And yes, it\u2019s \u2013 people say it\u2019s sweet and sour, but for me, it was tough to see him go. He repositioned OmniSource to record earnings last year, dramatically influenced their safety performance over the years and has been a key contributor to the strategic moves we\u2019ve made as a company. Right now, he is hiking in Virginia. And mate, thank you very much for everything you\u2019ve done. The recycled platform saw stronger earnings based on higher domestic steel industry utilization pushing demand up, drove higher shipment volume, pricing and associated metal spread. After a strong downward move in prime scrap relative to shred through the quarter, that spread is normalized and pricing is expected to remain more stable in the months ahead. The Omni platform is continuing to work with the steel melt teams to further expand our shred segregation to provide higher volumes of low residual shred scrap, which continues to reduce our dependence on more expensive prime grades. Pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to low $50 per ton range. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year, and supply is not an issue and the rumors of us having problems with fos levels and such is totally inaccurate. There\u2019s no problem using the Brazilian pig iron that we\u2019re bringing into our mills. Steel operations had another terrific quarter, record shipments of 3.1 million tons, strong operating income of $1.1 billion. Our second quarter production utilization rate was 95%, certainly above the industry average of some 82%. I think we clearly communicated in the past that higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated over time. Our strategy of the value-add diversified product offerings coming out with differentiated supply chains support that along with our internal support from fabrication and downstream. Altogether, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability. Our customer order entry remains strong. Support of value-added products is certainly a part of that. And as I said, we\u2019ve intentionally grown that value-added steel product mix, created valuable supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility. Today, some 70% of our steel sales are value-added. This supports our continued best-in-class financial metrics and cash generation. Specifically to the markets, we expect the automotive arena to remain strong and probably improve as the chip issue mitigates. You still have extremely low dealer inventories and a very strong pent-up vehicle demand from the consumer base. 2022 build rate, there\u2019ll be some, I don\u2019t know, around about 14 million units, and it\u2019s projected to grow to 16.4 million in 2023 and perhaps 16.8 million in 2024. I think the chip shortage actually for us is a good thing. It\u2019s effectively extending the auto cycle and just given us a market that\u2019s going to be strong for longer. Construction remains strong as evidenced with the fabrication backlog. Our long products steel backlogs are also strong and several of our divisions recorded record earnings and volume in the second quarter, demonstrating the market\u2019s depth. Infrastructure is a further meaningful support. High demand continues for HVAC, appliance and other related products. Energy continues to improve. We\u2019re getting large orders in the South. I think it\u2019s significant to note that the import arrivals that the sort of Ukraine-Russia conflict drove early in the year, those are arriving now, but there\u2019s very, very little import interest for sort of October, November, December. And I believe we\u2019re going to see moderated import volumes in the second half. And significantly, it appears our hot-rolled coil order input rate has grew dramatically in the last week or so, showing signs of an inflection there. Turning to Sinton. Commissioning continues on the hot side and tandem cold mill. The rest of the mill is fully operational. The hot mill has established target volume throughput rates with an average run rate of 75% to 80%. And I just want to emphasize that, that is when we are running, we\u2019re running at that rate. Surface quality is excellent. It\u2019s proven to be superior to both our Columbus and our Butler facilities. The hot strip mill design is allowed for thermomechanical rolling. That\u2019s allowing higher strength grades to be produced at lower alloy content. The reported coil shape from our processes is excellent. And so in total, it affirms the technical process capability of the equipment, affirms the design decisions that were made some years ago for the mill. We are wrestling a little with uptime in July. We have a substation arcing issue that should be resolved this week. We have some unique Texas power supply issues right now. And we are seeing some miscellaneous equipment failures that are typical of commissioning an integrated line. The supply chain is aggravating that a little bit because when you have a \u2013 when you need a part instead of getting it in a matter of hours, sometimes it takes a day or two. So we are wrestling with those alligators, not atypical of a start-up of new plant, but we expect substantial resolution of these issues over the next few weeks. So the July issue may have cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons of production for the year, we think, to [indiscernible] itself because July is not over yet, but certainly moving in the right direction, and we clearly expect to be EBITDA positive in the Q4. We continue on our growth. We have the four value-added coating lines under construction and progressing well. They\u2019re targeted for the second half of 2023 to start up. As you know, we \u2013 again, it\u2019s the strength of our overall strategy and our product mix, but we are the largest non-automotive coater of flat-rolled steels, and now have annual coating capacity of over 6 million tons. Four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We\u2019ve created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, and these lines are almost always fully utilized with our highest-margin products. So switching now to aluminum dynamics. It\u2019s been an incredibly exciting week, and it has been incredible. I said it earlier, it\u2019s been staggering, the initial support that we\u2019re seeing from all our customers and a massive number of new customers. To recap, it\u2019s a 650,000 metric ton a year flat-rolled facility that\u2019s going to be located in the Southeastern U.S. It have on-site melt and cast lab capacity of roughly 450,000 metric tons. It\u2019s a fully equipped flat-rolled mill with two cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging capability. It\u2019s going to be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest U.S. and one in Mexico. We expect the mill itself to start up in the first half of 2025, the Mexican slab casting center in 2024 and the Southwest slap casting center in \u2013 at the end of 2025. Financial impact the total project cost of some $2.2 billion. That expenditure is going to be spread over four years of the project. It\u2019s going to be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow through operations, and it\u2019s expected to add a good $650 million to $700 million in through-cycle consolidated annual EBITDA per year. We certainly anticipate no requirement to add any additional debt. From conversations on the call and subsequent conversations that there appears to be some skepticism regarding our EBITDA per ton target of $1,000. We are confident of that number. And it speaks to what was driven by a myriad of things, but firstly, it\u2019s a greenfield facility. Everything is happening essentially on one side or the rolling, processing, coating, heat treating. It allows for an optimum site layout and flow of material and logistics, and you can quite easily reduce the labor, the man power input because of that with robotics and automatic storage and retrievable systems. So labor input is going to be dramatically less than the current industry. We will not be burdened by aged facilities and legacy costs. Energy, because of the state-of-the-art equipment that where be installing is going to be a lot lower. Yield improvements will dramatically improve the cost structure, pushing higher scrap content levels and transportation, given the satellite slab casting centers transporting solid dense slab as opposed to scrap is going to be a significant improvement. So we\u2019re very, very confident of that cost projection. From an investment premise standpoint, obviously, we see a very clear gap in the supply and demand. There\u2019s a current and growing deficit, supply deficit. We see a very close sort of overlap and business alignment. And essentially, you could \u2013 if we filmed the steel mill and an aluminum mill in black and white, most people on the call today wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 all it is a different metal. We clearly will be able to execute the project well. It\u2019s incredibly cost-effective growth. Given the opportunities that are in the marketplace today, and the exorbitant multiples that are expected from sellers. This is a very, very CapEx efficient growth project. As I said, we have got absolutely great customer support. And at the end of the day, our success has always been driven by the SDI culture by our employees. It drives higher efficiency than anyone else, drive lower cost. And if you look at that industry, it has a very, very, very steep cost curve. And that will obviously \u2013 if you were at the lowest quartile, that\u2019s going to support margin through the cycle. So we\u2019re incredibly excited by the opportunity. So in general, it\u2019s been a phenomenal week. It\u2019s been a phenomenal year for SDI that will continue through the rest of this year. Our team provides our success, the foundation for that success, and I thank each of them for their hard work and their commitment. I remind each and everyone to remember, safety is always our first priority. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on providing superior value for our customers, through our company, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone in the years ahead. So with that said, I\u2019d like to pass the call over for questions. Holly? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily, your line is live. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Mark and Theresa, and thank you for the update today. My question is just around your power cost exposures across the portfolio. Can you highlight to us what is hedged or fixed price power and what still remains on spot? Is Sinton actually exposed to market prices? Or have you since put some hedges in place there? Theresa Wagler : Emily, we have \u2013 across the portfolio of those steel mills, we have a mix. So for example, and then to be able to split it out in a manner on a percentage basis, I\u2019ll have to kind of go back and talk to the team. But I would say it\u2019s probably at least 50% to 60% that\u2019s contractual, and they tend to be long-term contracts of two to three years, have escalating factors included in them. And the remainder is spot. There is some that we hedge. Sinton right now is a little bit difficult simply because, as Mark mentioned, we\u2019re in startup and they actually constructed a massive substation on our behalf in the region. And so I think most of Sinton at this point is still on a spot basis because of the stop and starts that we\u2019ve been having right now in July. Mark Millett : Emily, that\u2019s the electrical power. On the natural gas side of things, we typically hedge around about 60%, 65% of our consumption. Emily Chieng : Great. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Seth Rosenfeld with BNB Paribas. Seth, your line is live. Seth Rosenfeld : Thanks for taking our question. If I can ask one with regards to [indiscernible] fabrication and non-resi activity. At the time of Q1 results, I think you noted still record backlog and that change site to a near record. Can you give us any color for how significant of the contraction in backlog tons or duration has been realized? And on the pricing side, you commented earlier, aggregate price realizations will increase coming quarters. But on the most recently on orders, are we seeing any downward inflection of late? Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Seth. So as it relates to the fabrication business, we said near records just because of recent we have people back checking all the time and if it\u2019s not a record, we have to say near record. There has been some contraction from the peaks, but we\u2019re still having a backlog that\u2019s well into 2023. So it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re concerned about or we think it\u2019s endemic of anything changing significantly. From a pricing perspective, we\u2019re still having very strong price support, and there is still increased pricing that is included in the backlog. So we\u2019re feeling very good about the non-residential market, specifically for our steel fabrication business. Mark, do you have anything to add? Mark Millett : No, no. That sums it up well. Seth Rosenfeld : Thanks very much. Let\u2019s ask a separate question, please. On the working capital side, I think on the call earlier this week, you had a potential tailwind from working capital release moving forward. And Q2, you saw another quarter of large investment. Can you give us any color on your expectations for second half as steel raw materials price decline? Theresa Wagler : Absolutely, Seth. We\u2019re still \u2013 so I don\u2019t \u2013 I guess I wouldn\u2019t call it a significant increase. I think the increase in the second quarter for working capital was just a little over $100 million. So I thought that small, but given the size of the working capital at this point in time, it was incremental. But we would expect a pretty significant working capital release in the probably two to three quarters. And it has to do with not necessarily just have seen some weakness, as Mark mentioned, or some softening in the flat-rolled prices, but we\u2019ve also been specifically reducing physical inventories at our steel fabrication business as they had extra substrate for different reasons on the ground from a steel perspective. So there\u2019s some structural things that we\u2019re doing as well as from a pricing standpoint. So again, second half of the year into next year, I would expect working capital release. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos, your line is live. Carlos De Alba : Great. Thank you. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. The question is on CapEx progression for the aluminum project announced, how do you see the CapEx for this year and for the coming years until the project is ready to start up? Theresa Wagler : Carlos, I\u2019ll point you to the presentation that\u2019s still out on the website that we provided on Tuesday. But from a CapEx progression standpoint, we believe we\u2019ll spend somewhere between $200 million and $300 million on the flat-rolled aluminum project in 2022. That would be additive to the number that I gave you earlier for the estimate for the rest of 2022 of being in that $350 million to $400 million range. And then the bulk of the spend will be in 2023 and 2024, each of those years being around $750 million to $800 million. And then finally, we would have the remainder, which is around $300 million to $350 million in that 2025, 2026 time frame. So it\u2019s over a period of four to five years where we\u2019ll be spending the investment. And that\u2019s why Mark was very clear, and I\u2019ve tried to be clear as well that this will readily be funded through cash flow and cash flow from operations. Carlos De Alba : Fair enough. Thank you. And if I may just try another one quickly. Have you seen any particular pricing pressure in the steel Southern markets or Northern Mexico with the ramp-up of Sinton as well as the ramp-up of \u2013 steel ramp-up of Ternium\u2019s facility as well as Metals facility, a little bit further south in the Mexican market? Mark Millett : Well, I think, Carlos, you saw generally a sort of erosion on the hot band, hot-rolled coil pricing across the U.S. in general, and it was a little stronger in the South, because of the reasons that you suggest. As I suggested, we\u2019re seeing our order activity on hot band recently pick up dramatically. And so I think there\u2019s no support there in that product category. Carlos De Alba : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Good luck. Mark Millett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna, your line is live. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a little bit more, if I could, I know on the last call, when we\u2019ve spoken to you, you mentioned that you were looking at a pig iron alternative kind of leveraging your iron dynamics operations. So \u2013 if you could expand on that. And then if I could throw in one more. Just I thought it was interesting that you mentioned the market is pessimistic, but your customers are optimistic. So I was just hoping you could also elaborate on that. Thanks a lot. Mark Millett : Well, from a pig iron perspective, we certainly would like to pursue sort of some level of captive supply and self-sufficiency. And not unlike the last call, we are pursuing or exploring whether the Iron Dynamics technology or an alternative technology is best suited for us. But that\u2019s sort of a project in process going forward, Timna. If there were to be a project, again, from a capital perspective, that\u2019s not a huge, huge issue. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch the \u2013 quite the second comment or question. Timna Tanners : Thanks on Iron Dynamics. That\u2019s helpful. So it doesn\u2019t sound like a big capital use then, is that what you\u2019re saying? Mark Millett : Absolutely not. Yes. Timna Tanners : Okay. Helpful. Thank you. No, I just wanted to\u2026 Mark Millett : You had a market question? Timna Tanners : Yes, if you wouldn\u2019t mind elaborating, in the release, you talked about how there\u2019s a prevailing pessimism, but your customers are optimistic? And then you talked about hot-rolled order entry improving recently. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on how that contrasts with the pessimism and maybe some elevated inventories. Mark Millett : Well, I guess, all we can do or all I can do is look through the lens of our order book. And as I mentioned over the years, a wise man told me that, hey, the order book tells all, but it tells all for us. I can\u2019t speak for the rest of the industry. But we\u2019re not \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic structural sort of change in underlying demand. Order activity has remained pretty strong. There was a little softness in hot-rolled coil, and that\u2019s rebounding, I think. And so there\u2019s \u2013 when I say sort of motion in the marketplace, there seems to be a cloud out there that you got recessionary pressures and all these things going to drive the market there. As just pointed out, right now, through our order book, we don\u2019t see it. Timna Tanners : Thanks very much. Mark Millett : Thanks, Timna. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Phil, your line is live. Phil Gibbs : Hey, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Mark, you mentioned spot prices for pig iron are clearly coming down, and we see that, too. But are you all locked into higher numbers than that prevailing spot if you chose to hedge a lot more forward during the war? Mark Millett : We had, I would say, a mix. There were right at the onset of the conflict. We did buy a couple of both that were at the high end of that range over, but we now have a kind of a mix of material. I think the highest we may have paid is like $900 or so a ton. We got a couple of boatloads of that. But then we have a lot more material coming in at lower pricing. And the forward boats are tending to be indexed against the market price. So it shouldn\u2019t be a major impact for us. Phil Gibbs : Okay. And then Theresa, the normal mix dispersion on sheet, if you have it? Theresa Wagler : Absolutely, Phil. The hot roll P&L number is 861,000 tons; cold rolled, 131,000 tons; and the coated products are 1,132,000 tons. Phil Gibbs : Thank you. And if I could sneak in one more here. Just on Sinton, have you all changed your thought process on what it\u2019s going to do this year in terms of volume contribution to the second half? I\u2019m just trying to trying to read what you all have put now in terms of having lost production in July, but having got to high melt utilization at one point. So just trying to think through what the next few months look like here because we\u2019re getting to the tail end of the year. Mark Millett : Got it. The \u2013 and again, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re wrestling alligators a little, I guess, and sometimes you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to win. But I suggested earlier, our July issues have probably cost us 100,000, 150,000 tons, Phil, from our annual sort of projection, and we were around 1.5-ish. So you can do the math, Phil. Phil Gibbs : Okay. But that number was relative to the 1.5, that\u2019s kind of just what I wanted to hear in terms of understanding that. And then last question from a housekeeping standpoint is just what the updated CapEx numbers for this year, if I missed it, because I know you got the aluminum project and some other things that you had done there? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : So Phil, for the second half of the year, excluding the aluminum project, we estimate CapEx to be somewhere between $350 million and $400 million, and a majority of that relates to the four new flat-rolled coating lines. If we look at what we may spend on the aluminum investment, we\u2019ll likely spend an additional $200 million to $300 million. So the total second half of the year is likely to be somewhere between $550 million and call it, yes, around $550 million, $600 million. Phil Gibbs : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Andrew Keches with Barclays. Andrew, your line is live. Andrew Keches : Hi, good morning. Theresa, I don\u2019t want to belabor the point, but I want to try and ask the capital deployment question from earlier in the week in a slightly different way. So you have the two turns of net debt threshold out there, but the reality is you\u2019ve been operating at about half of that for the past year or so. And you made the comment, I think it\u2019s obvious that without buybacks, you\u2019d eventually find yourself net cash, and you also don\u2019t want to go to the bottom end of that range. So I guess what would be helpful is to know what you think the right level of leverage is for the business at this point in the cycle? Is 2 times the level where you\u2019re comfortable getting back to? Or should we take the fact that you\u2019ve been operating below that for the last year or so as an indication that you want to keep some flexibility within that range, so we\u2019re not just going to intentionally lever back up? Theresa Wagler : No, the intent isn\u2019t to intentionally lever the balance sheet. We like to maintain it at a flexible level to allow for growth projects just like we\u2019re doing right now. So we did this with Sinton as well. We started out with an additional cash, lower leverage on the balance sheet so that we were able to very easily commit to a capital investment that would be funded through cash and cash flow from operations, while maintaining flexibility and optionality in case there were to be some sort of acquisition opportunity that were to become available, et cetera, or in the absence of that, so that we\u2019re able to continue to have our very, we believe, is a positive shareholder distribution plan, which allows for us to continue to keep increasing the dividend at an appropriate level, because it is a forever type of investment for us. We want to make sure it\u2019s maintained at a manageable level. And then in addition to that, we have the opportunity to strategically and opportunistically use the share buyback program. So there is no intention to relever the balance sheet, but we are keeping that flexibility within it so that we can easily fund these projects. Andrew Keches : Okay. Maybe just as a quick follow-up. So what \u2013 you\u2019ve talked about the cash flow profile structurally changing, but the business is also growing. So what do you think the right level of cash is for the business going forward? Theresa Wagler : We actually don\u2019t manage to a cash level on the balance sheet. We look at liquidity in totality. And so yes, I\u2019m not really comfortable answering that question. Andrew Keches : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There appear to be no further questions in queue. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Holly. Again, thank you, everyone, for being on the call joining us today. Just finally, I\u2019d like to congratulate once again the team. Absolutely fantastic performance this past quarter, and we\u2019re continuing that through the rest of the year. To our customers, again, you have been loyal to us. Thank you for your support and for the growing support. And I would also like to look forward to welcoming our new customers on the aluminum side and any folks that want an incredibly dynamic career, come join us, we\u2019re going to be making some aluminum. So thank you very much, everyone. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

After management\u2019s remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Please be advised this call is being recorded today, October 20th, 2022, and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Ali. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics' third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results to turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses, as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading, Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You'll also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled, Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2022 results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. I forgot to turn the microphone on there as always. But thank you, everyone, for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. It certainly was an exciting quarter with great performance by the team and growth on many fronts. Firstly, a great welcome to the ROCA team, Senate in Monterrey. In combination with the former Zimmer Group, OmniSource Mexico now is a significant recycling presence within Mexico that will support their existing Mexican customer base, while providing strategic sourcing opportunities for our Sinton and Columbus steel mills and soon to be aluminum mill. Sinton has turned the corner and is showing significant improvement. The team is also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled strategy, which I will share later on the call. Operationally, our third quarter was a great quarter, achieving several new benchmarks, including record steel and steel fabrication shipments and record cash flow from operations, all supporting our cash allocation strategy and commitment to further expansion of shareholder value. I continue to be incredibly proud of our teams. They are on our foundation and the catalyst of our current and future success. It's their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through the cycle. So a great quarter, yet none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often employees are described as a company's most important resource. For us, they are more than that. They are family and the SDI family now is 26,000 strong. We are focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times at every level of our organization, came in top of mind and an active conversation throughout the company. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero incidents. But before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some details? Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and personal congratulations to the team on another strong operational and financial performance. Our third quarter 2022 net income was $914 million or $5.03 per diluted share, inclusive of costs of $111 million or $0.43 per diluted share associated with the continued start-up of our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding these costs, third quarter 2022 adjusted net income was $992 million or $5.46 per diluted share. Third quarter revenues of $5.7 billion declined 9% sequentially based on lower flat-rolled steel and scrap pricing. Our third quarter 2022 operating income was $1.2 billion lower than sequential results due to lower pricing and resulting metal spread compression in our flat-rolled steel operations. Our steel operations generated solid operating income of $658 million in the third quarter, with record shipments, as Mark mentioned, the 3.2 million tons, of which Sinton contributed 268,000 tons. Sequential earnings were significantly lower due to the previously mentioned metal spread compression within our flat-rolled steel businesses. In contrast, our long product steel operations experienced metal spread expansion as average scrap cost declined more than product pricing in the quarter. In fact, our Structural and Rail and Roanoke Bar divisions each achieved record earnings. Congratulations to those teams. Third quarter operating income for our mills recycling operations declined to $10 million as ferrous pricing declined month-over-month through the quarter, resulting in significant metal margin compression but the team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing company-wide working capital requirements. I also give my welcome to the Roanoke team. A huge congratulations once again to our steel fabrication team. They achieved record third quarter operating income of $677 million. These earnings were driven by record average pricing, record shipments and lower steel input costs. Steel joist and deck demand remained solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog, which extends well through the first half of 2023. We generated record cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion in the third quarter as strong results and release of working capital benefited cash flow. Year-to-date 2022, we've generated a record $3.3 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly low-cost variable cost structure. At the end of September, we had record liquidity of $3.2 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2 billion and an undrawn unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. Year-to-date 2022, we funded $565 million in capital investments. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimate capital investments will be close to $400 million, of which about $200 million is related to our recently announced aluminum flat-rolled investments, with much of the remaining capital related to our four new flat-rolled coating lines that will be located in Sinton and Heartland. We maintained our cash dividend at $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter. We also repurchased $482 million of our common stock in the third quarter, representing over 3% of our outstanding shares. Year-to-date, we paid cash dividends of $177 million and repurchased $1.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares, representing a 48% net income distribution ratio. At the end of the third quarter, $245 million remained available under our current share repurchase authorization. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability throughout all market cycles and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while remaining dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for strategic growth; strong shareholder returns and maintain investment-grade metrics. Our cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong shareholder distributions as we clearly demonstrated in the third quarter. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we're excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility will decrease our steel Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 25%. We have an actionable path to our carbon neutrality as more manageable, and we believe considerably less expensive than may lie ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. In conclusion, I know some of you track the details behind our flat-rolled shipments. And so for the quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 951,000 tons; cold rolled of 139,000 tons; and finally, coated flat rolled products of 1,102,000 tons. For a total of 2,192,000 tons of flat rolled shipments. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Teresa. And certainly, incredible results from the steel fabrication platform, a product that is obviously a market tailwind, but our strategic positioning over the years. We had record operating income of $677 million in the quarter, with the record shipments of 218,000 tons. Nonresidential construction markets remain strong, as would be suggested by the macro indicators. They all remain positive. ABI index of fitting a little over 53. ABI reports, business conditions remain generally strong, and Dodge Momentum Index improved 6% in September. Nonresidential starts and build rates are forecast to remain good into 2023. More importantly, our customers tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty. Order activity is better paced versus the frenetic pace of the recent past and remains higher than historical norms. Our order backlog is well into the first half of 2023 with strong pricing dynamics and we expect to see continued strong volume for fabrication in the fourth quarter and for 2023 in general. Aside from the significant advantage of pull-through volume for our sheet mills, New Millennium provides a perfect hedge to our steel operations. Although SDI mills saw steady utilization throughout the third quarter, lower domestic steel industry utilization in general reduced the demand for scrap in the quarter. First, scrap prices have declined month-over-month beginning in May through October, prime dropping from some $735 a ton to more recently around about $380 per gross ton. Omni's earnings suffered as a result of this progression in market pricing and weaker industry demand. The Omni platform is continuing to work with our steel mill teams to expand our shred separation opportunities to provide even higher volumes of low residual scrap. The impact of our efforts, along with others in the industry, has amply demonstrated our view that innovation will solve any perceived fears of prime scrap shortage in the years ahead. With additional producers coming to the market, pig iron availability is normalized and pricing has moderated significantly to a little over $500 per ton. We have sufficient pig iron sourced well into next year. Supply is not an issue for our flat rolled operations. And again, we're excited for the addition of Roka to our OmniSource Mexico portfolio, which now will grow to some 2.5 million tons of ferrous and non-ferrous annual capability. It was another historically strong quarter for the steel platform. We had record shipments of 3.2 million tons and operating income of $658 million. Our third quarter production utilization rate was around 93%, which was incrementally lower than the second quarter that was 95%, yet significantly above the industry average of 78%. High utilization rates are clearly demonstrated through time. Value-added diversified product offerings, differentiated supply chain solutions all support and the support of internal pull-through volume all support that utilization -- higher utilization rate compared to our peers. And in turn, it supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash the industry capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid and that's supported by our diversified portfolio of value-added products, which comprised now of around 70% of steel sales. We focus on value-creating supply chains to mitigate the impact of price volatility and all this just maintains a higher through-cycle utilization rate. Relative to the markets, we see automotive steady at current rates and we expect that to improve off low 2022 production based on the extremely low dealer inventories and pent-up vehicle demand. The 2022 build rate is going to be some 14.5 million units, and we would expect 2023 to grow to 15.5 units or so, and 2024 to 16-plus units -- million units. Non-residential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Long product steel backlogs are good and several of our divisions, Summa City and Roanoke in particular, achieved strong volumes and record earnings in the third quarter, demonstrating our market depth. Infrastructure spending should also provide further meaningful support in the coming years. New residential construction has softened a little, impacting HVAC and appliance and other housing-related products. Fortunately, our portfolio is biased to replacement, and we won't get a ton of a ton impact. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe, and solar renewable expansion continues to grow. Turning to Sinton. Both coating lines are running extremely well, and ramp-up continues on the hot side in the tandem cold mill. I believe the hot mill has certainly turned the corner, becoming more consistently running at a 60%, 65% month-to-date with days exceeding well over 80%. Surface quality is excellent. Reported coil shape from processing customers is also excellent. And our hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing higher strength grades with lower alloy content and associated costs. And we've already been approved and shipped some API grades, which is quite remarkable given the mill has only been up and running for what, nine months. So the team has done a phenomenal job. And I think it certainly affirms our technical and process choices and it is indeed a next-generation mill. Our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash allocation strategies and growth. The four value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are going well and are targeted for the second half of 2023 for startup, two for Sinton and two for Heartland, and we're already seeing customer interest for that new volume. We're the largest domestic non-automotive coater of flat-rolled steel with an annual coating capacity over 6 million tons. These four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always full with our highest margin products. Relative to the lunar dynamics, the market response from both current and new customers across all market sectors has been absolutely incredible. And so to recap that project, it's a 650,000 metric ton a year aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in the Southeastern US, and we expect to announce that site location in the next few weeks. On-site mill and cash slab capacity will consist of 450,000 metric tons, and that will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in the Southwest US and one in the South. We'll have two cash lines, coating line and downstream processing and packaging lines. So we'll be able to furnish all products to the beverage -- food packaging arena, automotive and industrial. The mill is planned to start up in mid-2025, the Mexico Slab Center in 2024 and the Southwest Slab Center in the first quarter of 2025. The financial impact will be around $2.2 billion CapEx over four years. It's going to be funded 100% with available cash and cash flow from operations with no additional debt needed. We expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through cycle annual EBITDA once it's up and running. So in closing, we're excited and passion by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have demonstrated over the last 15 years. Our teams are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their desire to excel. We are committed to the health and safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continues to positively differentiate our performance from others. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today and in the years ahead. So with that said, we would love to answer any questions you might have. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thank you for the time this morning. My question is just around the fabrication business, and we've certainly seen realized pricing trend higher on a sequential basis. But perhaps could you share some color on where new contract awards are getting priced? And how should we be thinking about the sustainability of your margins in this segment in the near-term and perhaps call it on a normalized basis? Mark Millett : Certainly, Emily. Well, again, that business is incredibly robust. Our backlogs are so from a volume standpoint and pricing standpoint at historic highs. And we see that backlog well into 2023, probably about eight months from there, and it remains solid. Spreads are at very high numbers, as you can see from our most recent results. And we see that volume being sustained. Our Q3 volume into Q4. And our earnings should certainly parallel that as relative to the third quarter. I do believe. So very, very strong. As you may recognize, that industry over the years is sort of rationalized and consolidated. And no longer fragmented as it once was. And we see higher pricing and higher spreads being sustained through the cycle going forward. Emily Chieng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Thank you very much. Good morning. So the question is based on the comments for end markets, it seems that long products should be doing better than the flat end markets on the lending products. But in the reported volumes, we saw your long steel volumes falling a little bit quarter-on-quarter, while flat improved. So I just wonder if you can give us a little bit of your -- how you see that evolving in the fourth quarter? Do you think that this is going to probably reverse based on the end market situation and how those are evolving? And also you mentioned in your press release that, seasonally, you see lower volumes in the fourth quarter. However, your seasonality in the last couple of years has been quite different than what we saw in, say, 2015 to 2019 prior to the pandemic. So if you could share some color as to how you see the seasonality playing out this time around will be also great. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, Carlos, thanks for joining us on the call. So from the specifics of flat increasing, while, I would say, long products was very strong, because long products had record shipments in the second quarter, so still very strong. But you have to remember that, Sinton is starting up in this time frame. So the addition of Sinton ramping up helps offset some of the seasonality that you might see in our flat roll shipments even as we head into the fourth quarter. That being said, we're expecting still to see really resilient volume from the steel base, both in long and flat, as we head into the -- what -- you're correct, is more of a seasonal time frame, but we have some offsetting parameters as we look at both Sinton. And frankly, as we look at our coated products, specifically Galvalume had a really strong third quarter. Carlos De Alba : Right. Thank you, Theresa. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning. Timna Tanners : I wanted to just ask you about things, you utilization continuing to be higher than peers. And it's a pretty big contrast, as you point out, you're ramping up Sinton. And meanwhile, US Steel has cut production, saying there's not enough demand. And your utilization is a pretty stark contrast. I'm just -- and Nucor said that they're being disciplined in holding off tons because of weaker demand. So I'm just wondering, you can explain what's different about what you're seeing? And if you could, while you do that, if you could talk a little bit about the opportunities that you'd mentioned in the past for exporting to Mexico and the West Coast from the Sinton operation. Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, Timna, I think, as we told in the past, I do believe our business model is definitely differentiated from our peers for sure. And the high utilization rate is triggered, I think, probably in three spots. One, is we have a much more diversified value-add product portfolio mix than probably any steel producer in the state today. That allows us optionality across all market sectors and all market products, and that certainly has a significant impact. I do believe we have cultivated and developed over time some pretty unique supply chain sort of partnerships with many of our customers, and that gives us resilience through the cycle. And then thirdly, the pull-through volume of our sort of downstream conversion facilities and New Millennium is quite considerable. So if you look at this year, New Millennium, we'll be consuming about somewhere close to probably 800,000 tons of substrate. And much of that is procured through our own mills. So there's a massive volume sort of pull through there. And then our Heartland facility, which is roughly 800 million ton a year converter takes material and also The Techs, which has 850,000, 900,000 tons of consumption. So that pull-through volume onto itself. When there's a need, we bring a lot more of that in-house to maintain that utilization. And as you point out, through the cycle, we typically at 10%, 15% higher utilization than the industry in general. And I can't overemphasize the impact that has on our through-cycle cash generation capability. It certainly supports that and in turn, supports all the growth and the cash allocation strategies that we -- the balanced cash allocation strategies that we continue to execute. Timna Tanners : Okay. Great. Would you mind on the other part of the question about the opportunities that you'd allocation strategies that ability to ramp -- produce at higher levels as well? Mark Millett : Yes. Sorry. I mean, a little tough time hearing Timna. The Sinton mill, obviously, ramping up focused on furnishing material through the two coating lines, the galvanized line, the paint line and just ramping up and commissioning all the different product capabilities we have there. We believe Mexico will long-term despite the additional hot band capability that's come on stream, we'll continue to have a mismatch in the cold-rolled coated arena and so it's our intent to be transferring or selling into the Mexican market, HVAC appliance, and automotive there. And we have yet to develop a meaningful sort of shipping volume to the West Coast, but I'm confident that, that will occur over time as that ramp continues. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Cleveland Rueckert with UBS Securities. Cleveland Rueckert : Hey everybody. I'll say good day, it's almost noon here. I appreciate question I'll stick to one, just to start. But Mark, I wanted to build on your comment about raw materials and scrap availability. I'm just curious, as we think about investment opportunities, I get that you're shifting investment into aluminum and that's kind of the priority right now. But -- is there any opportunity to invest in some of the raw materials businesses that you already own? I think on these calls before; you've talked about increasing usage of different scrap grades. I'm just wondering if that's more of an R&D exercise on your part on the steel operations or if there's some infrastructure that you're thinking could add some efficiency there? Mark Millett : Well, I think the -- given our investment in Mexico for Zimmer and with Roka where we thought there was a very unique opportunity that, that arena is prime scrap rich and it would allow us to support Columbus and Sinton. Beyond that, we're not interested in any sort of large-scale recycled sort of acquisition-type investment. The investments will be centered though on streamlining and improving our existing operations, lowering our cost structure throughout that organization. And more specifically, investing in sort of segregation separating type technologies to optimize the streams, the waste streams that we have. So the ore, the switch and everything divide that up into more value-added 5,000, 6,000 series type raw materials for our aluminum mill. And also investing in technologies and expanding our current technologies because in all honesty, on the ferrous separation, what we call Shred One [ph], the improved shredded material; we have the technologies available to us. It's just a matter of expanding that across our omni base. And those technologies, they honestly, it's not a massive amount of CapEx spend. Can be underemphasized though, how that's impacting the scrap flows, and it's not just us. Some of our peers are doing the same thing, producing a very low residual shred. And as I've said in the past, if you look at a shredded car today, if you just take a piece of the rusty metal itself, that's likely been produced through a integrated mill and is a very, very low residual. So by separating out the little bit of copper and nickel, you can get a prime scrap from that obsolete flow. And I think we're seeing it, you can see it in the marketplace today where prime is actually selling under the shred price today. And it is amplifying the fact that their perceived concerns as additional capacity comes online over the next few years. But I think we've demonstrated clearly -- the industry has demonstrated clearly what I've always said, and as innovation will trump a challenge each and every day. Cleveland Rueckert : That\u2019s well understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Yeah. Thanks Mark and Theresa. So on Sinton, Mark, I think you mentioned that it had turned the corner. How close are you there to operating at consistent 80% rate? What are the remaining challenges? And then what needs to happen to get it up to 90%, 95% or whatever you would be targeting longer term? And is that the rate you would be expecting 90%, 95% exit rate in 2023? So you stopped below 80% and then you build up through the year, or it would be more of a consistent rate through the year? Thanks. Mark Millett : Well, I would describe the issues at Sinton today as just typical start-up issues, a little amplified by the supply chain constraints out there. In the old days or the other mills we started up, you need a spare part, and it's like literally on the shelf in the local city. We were seeing a little more time to react to certain issues. That said, it is purely just making sure that we are operating each piece of equipment all the way from the electric arc furnaces through the label furnaces cast and external just operating each and every minute of each and every day. As I said earlier, the equipment is proven to be able to produce everything we intended. It's produced out to 84 wide. We've gone down to 043 or 044 and light gauge. We produced 1-inch plate. As I said earlier, we've already been certified on some of the perhaps slightly easier API grades, but the other grades will come with time. There's no issue or challenge to get there. It's just a matter of time. So from a capability standpoint, it's definitely there. We've had shifts. We've had days close to 85%, 86% of production rate, which again, given the relative short time that, that team has been ramping up is absolutely incredible. I think it took us three years in Butler to get a 4,000 ton shift, and we've had many of those already. So I'm not concerned. It's just a matter of time. Would expect that 2023, we should get around 80% of our 3 million tons of shipping capability. Theresa Wagler : But Alex, you're correct. That's for the entirety of the year. So there will be a progression of ramp so that by the time we're exiting 2023, we would expect to be operating at or near that capacity rate -- that full capacity rate. Alex Hacking : Okay. Thanks. And then just to clarify on the earlier comments, again, on Sinton. Would you be expecting to ship more flat-rolled in the 4Q, considering the ramp-up of Sinton or the seasonality will offset that? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Alex, I think you were asking about the full complement of our flat roll operations? And we are expecting to have higher shipments from Sinton itself, but I'll leave you to determine what seasonality does to the rest of the group. Alex Hacking : Okay. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Curt Woodworth : Yes. Hi, Mark and Theresa. How are you? Mark Millett : Good, thanks. Curt Woodworth : So I just wanted to talk a little bit more about fabrication. Can you kind of talk to the diversity within your backlog and maybe how bidding activity has progressed maybe the last 90 days? I think there is some concern in the market that the data center and warehouse build-out has really driven the bulk of this growth rate, and that could potentially fall sharply. And it sounds clear, if you have like a lot of big chunky projects that once those burn off, then you could be more at risk. And then within that, I know you spoke about pricing being fairly favorable. And I think you talked about how pricing would be going up progressively, I believe, into the second quarter, but can you just confirm that? Theresa Wagler : Good afternoon, Kurt. Thanks for the question. I'll let Mark address the diversity within the backlog of the fabrication business. It has changed just slightly. And I think it's become more favorable as these things are changing. As it relates to the backlog and the pricing, what Mark was suggesting is that we still have incredibly favorable pricing heading with the backlog that goes through much of the first half of 2023. It's not likely to be at that same peak level of $5,000-plus, but still very favorable. And at the same time, we're going to and expect to have lower steel input costs as we move through at least the fourth quarter. And so, as you can imagine, that's why the power in the business model of having fabrication be a real natural hedge to lower steel prices is very favorable to us. And that's what you're seeing today, and we would expect to see in the coming quarters as well. Mark, do you want to describe the diversity in the order backlog? Mark Millett : Yes. I think it is transitioning a little bit. Early on, it was very, very sort of distribution warehouse focused with cloud computing and things are following along. Cloud computing, construction tends to be -- continue to be strong and grow. Warehouse may be kind of flat to stable. And we're also seeing sort of more infrastructure, hospitals, school type construction activity. So we see it strong. I mentioned earlier, it's not at the frenetic pace that it was perhaps six months ago or eight months ago. It's normalized to still very high relative to historic norms. And if you think about it, given the interest rate sort of environment and the little economic cloud that we have, it's not unexpected that people are wondering about projects, 7, 8, 9, 10 months out, and they're just waiting a little. But, in general, we see that just the nonresidential construction in general, remaining very, very, very robust through certainly the first half of next year into the latter half. Theresa Wagler : And just to address your point on the backlog, if there's any risk that we\u2019d want to point out, there's really not. It's a well-diversified backlog. There's not individual projects that are of too large of a size. And something to just keep in mind as well as once something enters the backlog for the fabrication business, the projects have already been engineered. They generally have already been financed. There's a lot of certainty in that backlog. And if you look on average of the projects that we do, the cost of steel joist and steel jack or steel deck as a part of the entire project itself is only between 10% and 15%. So it's a small piece of that project in and of itself, which also reduces the risk. Curt Woodworth : Okay. Very helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, I think there have been some maybe incremental concerns on the aluminum flat rolled market, just given some of the announcements by Ball and others on the beverage can sheet side. So can you just give an update on maybe how you're progressing commercially with that project and what initial discussions have been like since you announced the project? Thanks very much. Mark Millett : Well, relative to aluminum, we are awash with interest, an incredible interest. To be honest, we have been focused of late locating the facilities. Glenn and his team have just, in the last week or two, completed the purchase of all the major sort of components. Certainly, all the long lead time issues, equipment packages. So progress is being made dramatically. We're now starting to focus on the commercial side. We've had initial conversations with all but one of the major beverage outfits, can makers. Incredible interest in honesty there. And also in automotive, there are several folks that have approached us to partner with us going forward. So, from a standpoint of contracted volumes, pricing, those sorts of things, that's too early yet. Curt Woodworth : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Phil Gibbs with KeyBanc. Philip Gibbs : Sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me now? Mark Millett : We can. Hi Phil. Philip Gibbs : Hey, how are you? Mark Millett : Good. Philip Gibbs : Specifically, you talked about in the script that you were at a 60% to 65% utilization on average for the month of October so far. Is that what we should expect for the fourth quarter, which would get us near 500,000 tons for that asset, or do we expect something a little bit more than that as you ramp? Mark Millett : I would not expect 65% for the whole quarter. No. But I -- Phil, it's tough to give you a number. If things continue to proceed as they have, month-to-date, then you're going to see a very good number for the quarter. But I can't foretell the future. All I can say is the operation has reached a more stable, consistent level of operation. The big shifts or the big days, there are more of them. But more importantly, we're not seeing the zero shifts as we once were in the summer and as you see in any startup. So, the consistency of operation is very, very much improved and gives me a lot of confidence going forward. Philip Gibbs : Should we expect, given higher volume incrementally and some of that stabilization and just the overall operations that you will get to EBITDA positive in the fourth quarter and sort of out of the start-up phase that you've been in? Theresa Wagler : Yes, Phil, good afternoon. We talked about it on the second quarter conference call that our expectations were sitting at that point in time was that we would reach EBITDA positive sometime in the fourth quarter. That's likely pushed out sometime in the first quarter rather than the fourth quarter. But definitely, as Mark mentioned, we're seeing a lot of positive changes and there's been some key successes that the teams had just recently in October that we would expect to result in some really good changes heading forward. But I would suggest it's probably closer to in the first quarter versus the fourth. Philip Gibbs : Okay. And then as just a follow-up, if you could take a shot and talking about 2023 CapEx if you have a general idea? And then just also thoughts on net working capital in Q4. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : You're welcome. So we're in the middle of our detailed planning phase related to capital. I'll give some directionality, but we would have more clear and defined expectations for you as we meet in January for the fourth quarter conference call. But right now, the aluminum investments still look like we'll be spending about $750 million in 2023 as it relates to both the recycled shop centers and the rolling mill itself. We also have the completion of the four flat roll lines, which is likely to be around $200 million in 2023. And then we have the biocarbon facility. So I would say just those growth projects alone will probably get us to around $1 billion for capital spending in 2023. And then as we think about the additional projects that we're evaluating right now, I would suggest that it shouldn't be any greater than $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, but we'll have more clarity as we talk to you in January. I'm sorry. Thanks, David. And as it relates to the working capital, as we've had -- as we expect to see some seasonality in volume for customers to reorient their inventories by the end of the year, and as we've seen pricing declines in both scrap and in steel, I would expect to see another pretty significant funding from working capital. So a contribution from working capital in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas. Tristan Gresser : Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. First one is on the cost of ferrous scrap. This came much higher than what we forecasted. And I guess this is due to the purchase of more expensive metallics in H1 that some of your peers also flagged. Are you able to quantify this extra negative impact yet in the quarter? And do you believe this will remain a headwind into Q4? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : So the question related to ferrous scrap pricing and our average price was higher than expected from their models. And I would tell you, there's a significant piece of that that has to do with higher pig iron prices. So during the first quarter with the Russian-Ukraine circumstance, we, as did others, went out and purchased more pig iron to have certainty around supply. It was at a higher price than we're currently seeing today, which I think Mark mentioned was around $500 per ton. And so the flat-rolled steel mills, specifically Sinton, Columbus and Butler are still working through that higher cost pig iron at this time. Mark, do you wish to add any more commentary? Mark Millett : The pig iron, and we also ended the quarter with some scrap inventory that obviously flows through into the higher-priced scrap inventory that flowed into the third quarter, too. Those inventories are well in control now, and we're back to four-week, maybe five-week inventory level. So going forward, I think that will normalize. But the pig iron price in all honestly is going to continue into the fourth quarter, for sure. Tristan Gresser : Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on the Buy Clean Initiative that has been put in motion by the US government. What kind of impact are you expecting from that new policy the potential boost to demand? And are you seeing already some impact on that initiative? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : From a Buy America policy, I'm sorry, it was hard to hear you at the very end. Is it had -- it related to the Buy-America policy, that is still so early on. We're not seeing a considerable amount of traction from it at this point. Conversations with customers on the commercial side though, we believe that it won't just be Buy America, but if you look at, again, our steel operations, specifically as it relates to even our current low carbon footprint for our carbon steels and our long product steel, we believe will be the beneficiary continuing going forward of that, I'm going to call it steel for lack of a more simple terminology at this point in time. And we believe that the Buy America will also have a positive influence. As well as the Jobs Act and the infrastructure program, which you should really start seeing traction from in the next nine to 12 months. That should support steel consumption in the US specifically in our estimation. Mark, do you have anything to add? Mark Millett : No.  : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you. Do you expect a significant drop in scrap flows with funds and [ph] scrap steel prices? Mark Millett : John, they've eased and ebbed a little. I would say that reduction in flow is probably going to sort of mitigate any further substantial decline in scrap pricing. John Tumazos : Thank you. Mark, I just want to recall that we met in 2083 at Darlington when you were working the House Lancaster for Nucor when you were a fresh student. Mark Millett : I remember. John Tumazos : Your aluminum competitors have 30- to 50-year old house with Twin belt casters that you intimately understand often unionized. And maybe you're a little bit too humble or modest and don't want to say that you think you can build a new plant with an SMS design that's more efficient. People don't understand the opportunity you have in aluminum and congratulations. It looks great. Mark Millett : Thank you, John. Thanks for the memory. But I do believe, to your point, the new aluminum mill -- and honestly, I don't look at it as an aluminum mill. It's a new horizon. It's the aluminum business for us. And it's not unlike 27 years ago, when we put SDI together and we penetrated and have been somewhat successful growing within the steel industry. The same sort of drivers exists today in aluminum as it did back in steel. You've got an aged industry, has very, very high legacy costs for sure, inefficiencies. Hasn't been a new mill built for some 45 years. And as you know, Glenn and his team is incredibly smart and talented getting the right technology and building it effectively and efficiently. It's exciting. And it's exciting for the young team that we have to see that being the foundation of our growth for the next 25 years. John Tumazos : Congratulations. Mark Millett : Thanks mate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Hi, guys. Thanks for the follow-up. I guess I had another big picture question, if you could indulge me. There are so many new galvanizing lines being added just by you guys, by Nucor for sure, definitely some planned ones around the corner potentially from US Steel in Ternium. I'm just wondering, is there a structurally better outlook for galvanize? There some incremental demand story or some supply piece I'm missing that's going to continue to support that level -- increased level of galvanized supply? Mark Millett : Well, I think the utilization of galv product is just generally expanding. I don't know whether you have a crawl around cars, but over my 20 or 30 years, it went from just one or two parts of the car to be galvanized -- or almost the whole car is becoming galvanized. So I think there's just a general expansion of that. Over time, people talk about the lightweighting in the automotive arena or lightweighting comes from stronger products, but also comes through thinner gauge material. So if you look at the length of coated material today versus the past. Just thinner means less throughput and needs more lines to get the same volume. So, I don't see there being a galvanized flood or issue that you might see. Timna Tanners : Okay, great. Thanks again. Appreciate it. End of Q&A: Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, super. Well, thank you, everyone, for your time today. Certainly, for those that have enabled our success, our customers, our service providers, and most importantly, our teams absolutely phenomenal group of people. We appreciate your loyalty, because we've been doing business together for years and years and years. And to those in the investment community that support us, thank you. We will endeavor to continue to treat our money or SDI's money like our own, like your money. We're going to utilize it very, very effectively. I think if you look at our use of those proceeds, we're very diligent, very disciplined in this interesting environment, spending money, again, effectively with higher returns than perhaps the industry in general. So thank you. Thank you for your support and to every individual of the SDI family that's on the line. Thank you for what you do. Be safe each and every day and look after each other. Cheers. Bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

After management\u2019s remarks, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Please be advised this call is being recorded today, January 26, 2023, and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Jenny. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics Fourth Quarter and Full-year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today\u2019s call are Mark Millett, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today\u2019s statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and is applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics reports fourth quarter and full-year 2022 results. And now I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2022 earnings call. And as I think you saw, operationally, our teams had a very, very, very solid fourth quarter. Our New Millennium Building Systems platform generated record steel fabrication earnings, Sinton is showing significant operating improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter of 2023. Our new aluminum group is making great progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments, and I will share more details later in the call. Relative to full-year 2022, the entire Steel Dynamics delivered an exceptional performance with record sales, earnings and cash flow generation. I think it was a tremendous achievement, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of our team. They are the foundation of our company, and they are the ones that have truly driven our success over the years. It is their culture of excellence and the strategic positioning executed over the last number of years that allows us to maximize opportunities resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles. However, none of this matters without keeping our teams safe. Often, employees are described as a company\u2019s most important resource. But for Steel Dynamics, they are more than that, they are a family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We are continually focused and provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We are actively engaged in safety at all times at every level, came in to top of mind and an active conversation at all levels through the organization. And with that focus, the team\u2019s safety performance improved significantly in 2022. We but there is certainly more to do as we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. But before I add any more detail, Theresa, would you like to give us some detailed financial results. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team. We continue to hit new milestones throughout the company achieving record annual performance in 2022, with record revenues of $22.3 billion derived from strong product pricing and volumes across all of our operating platforms. Record operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $3.9 million or $2.92 per diluted share, and record cash flow from operations of $4.5 billion with EBITDA of $5.5 billion. As Mark mentioned, is truly an exceptional performance. Regarding our fourth quarter 2020 results, net income was $635 million or $3.61 per diluted share which includes additional performance-based special compensation of $24 million or $0.09 per diluted share that was awarded to all nonexecutive eligible team members and recognition of their extraordinary performance and costs of approximately $168 million or $0.67 per diluted share associated with our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill ramp. Our fourth quarter 2022 operating income declined 35% sequentially to $759 million due to lower realized selling values and seasonally lower shipments within our steel operations, which individually generate operating income of $178 million with shipments of 3 million tons in the fourth quarter. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high-cost pig iron that was purchased earlier in 2022 during the early stages of Russia and Beijing of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices of $500 per ton versus our average cost incurred in the fourth quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by about $80 million. We expect to see that continue into the first quarter and the negative impact is likely to be around $60 million as we work through all the higher price pig iron before the end of the first quarter. For the full-year 2022, operating income from our steel operations was $3.1 billion, representing the second strongest year in our history, with record annual shipments of 12.2 million tons. Fourth quarter operating income from our metals recycling operations improved to $14 million based on increased volume and metal spread expansion despite lower average selling values. For the full-year 2022, operating income from our mills recycling operations was $130 million. Due to lower volume and average selling values, our spare scrap prices fell nine out of 12 months during the year. It was sequentially lower than the record results in 2021. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our Southern steel mills and driving profitability. I want to say a sincere thank you to the Zimmer and Roka team. We continue to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap to our steel mills which improves furnace efficiency, lowers cost and reduces company-wide working capital needs. And once again, our steel fabrication operations achieved record quarterly operating income of $682 million as metal spreads continue to expand based on steady product pricing and lower steel input costs, which more than offset the impact of seasonally lower shipments. steel joists and deck remains solid as evidenced by our continued strong order backlog and which extends through the first half of 2023. Our steel fabrication platform also achieved another record year in 2022, with operating income of $2.4 billion eclipsing last year\u2019s record of $365 million. Congratulations to the entire team, well done. This demonstrates the power of our circular manufacturing model and the natural hedge our steel fabrication business provides to steel price shifts. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion due to strong results in the release of working capital. For the full-year, we generated a record $4.5 billion, our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low-cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.4 billion comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.2 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During 2022, we invested $909 million in capital investments of which over half related to ongoing construction of our four new flat-rolled coating lines and our aluminum flat-rolled mill investments. For 2023, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our flat-rolled coating lines. Since our last call, we also announced the location for our aluminum rolling mill as Columbus, Mississippi. Mark will share the strategy of the location later in the call. We are also incredibly pleased to have received near-term state incentives for the project, of $250 million with meaningful additional tax benefits to occur over the next 15-years. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend of $0.34 per common share after increasing at 31% in the first quarter of 2022. We also repurchased $413 million of our common stock in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, we paid cash dividends of $237 million and repurchased $1.8 billion or 12% of our outstanding shares, representing a 53% net income shareholder distribution rate. At the end of the year, $1.3 billion remains available under our current share authorization program. Since 2017, we have increased our cash dividend per share by 119% and we have repurchased $4.2 billion of our common stock, representing 31% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that is complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We have strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment-grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $580 million between 2011 and 2015 to $2.6 billion today between 2018 and 2022. Our recently announced aluminum investment is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investment with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we are dedicated to our people, our communities under environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we are excited about our newly formed joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe, considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with an intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. As I conclude my remarks, I know there is some of you that follow more detail of our flat-rolled shipments. So for the fourth quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 959,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 109,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1.1 million tons. Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. Well, as was mentioned, steel fabrication saw phenomenal results in the platform in the year. And again, thank you to the Penal team. I think their effectiveness and their efficiency and their output per employee exceeds anyone in the industry. So congratulations to you and thank you for all you do there. It was another record quarterly performance, and record annual operating income of $2.4 billion for the year, with record shipments of 856,000 tons. Although the macro industries remain a little mixed, we believe nonresidential construction markets are and will continue to remain strong throughout the year. Despite lower ABI indications, I believe overall architectural firms remain optimistic for 23 Dodge Momentum Index improved around about 6% in December. And nonresidential starts and build rates are also forecast to remain solid through the year. I think the continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the infrastructure spending programs will start kicking in that will continue to provide momentum for construction spending. More relevant, I think our customers certainly tell us demand remains solid in spite of economic uncertainty, and it is certainly confirmed by current order rates, not only in the joist and deck business but also our structural products business as well. Our steel fabrication order backlog extends through the first half of 2023, with strong pricing dynamics. And with continued solid order intake rates, we expect to see continued strong volume and performance those operations throughout 2023. And the fabrication platform is not only a significant contributor itself, but it provides significant pull-through volume for our steel mills, allowing higher through-cycle utilization rates, and it also provides a meaningful natural hedge to lower steel pricing. Our MEL\u2019s recycling platform had a solid year, especially in light of the challenging pricing environment. During 2022, ferrous scrap prices declined nine out of 12 months and volumes were marginally lower. The team managed to achieve metal margins that were only $2 per gross ton lower than record 2021 results. After seven consecutive months of declining price during 2022, First scrap prices improved in December and January, and it is our expectation that pricing will continue a moderate seasonal increase during the first quarter. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our growing Mexican volumes will enhance our Columbus and symptom positions and the Zimmer and Roka acquisitions are performing very well, and integration is outstanding. Our metals recycling team continues to partner with our steel teams to expand traded scrap separation to provide more high-quality, low-residual scrap to our steel mills. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry, has demonstrated that innovation will provide ample scrap supply in the years ahead. Similarly, we are also exploring technologies for more effective aluminum scrap separation in anticipation of sourcing material for our upcoming aluminum flat rolled operations to maximize recycled content. Steel operations achieved record shipments in the second best annual earnings in 2022, again, outstanding performance by an outstanding team. So thank you for each and every one of you there, record shipments of 12.2 million tons, operating income of $3.1 billion. Our 2022 steel production utilization rate was 92%, excluding Sinton, compared to a domestic industry rate of 78%. And again, our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Our value-added diversified product offerings differentiated supply chain solutions provides stickiness and the support of our internal pull-through manufacturing volume has clearly demonstrated time and time again that we can maintain a higher utilization than our peers in the industry. As a key differentiator. It supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. In actuality, December was a historically high order intake month followed by another historic high order intake year-to-date. So we see a very, very, very solid market developing for the rest of the year. Auto production is expected to increase in 2023 from the lower 2022 rates. Dealer inventories have improved, but still remain meaningfully below historic norms. The build rate in 2022 was roughly 14.3 million units, and it is expected to grow a little to about 15%, 15.1% for 2023 and higher thereafter. Nonresidential construction remains solid as evidenced by fabrication backlog, and as I said, the long product steel volumes. Residential construction has certainly softened. It is impacting HVAC, appliance and other housing-related products, but fortunately, much of our portfolio is biased toward replacement. Oil and gas activity is driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow. And I think generally, this market strength is clearly supporting market price appreciation and in particular, the challenges with OMS in Mexico, has certainly changed the regional sort of markets and the Mexico a stand in Mexico and the U.S. market is certainly benefiting from that. In Sinton, the downstream coating lines are running well. They are running below full capacity, though, as the rest of the mill continues to work through start-up items. The hot mill, and that is the good news, the homes turned the corner, running more consistency, approaching 65% capability month-to-date. We have been experiencing very, very long sequence lengths on the case recently up to 22 hours at a time. We are achieving days in excess of 85% capacity, and we should be around about 150,000 tons for the month of January and improving thereafter. Our current utilization is certainly being impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and roles. This is specific to the casted roles in the segments. But we expect to have this resolved before the end of the first quarter, which will allow for a much stronger production for the rest of the year. Additionally, high-priced pig iron inventory is being drawn down through the quarter and the raw material input cost was normalized for Q2 through the rest of the year. While financial performance will likely be flat there in the first quarter, as we consume that high-price pig iron we expect significant events in both productivity and earnings in Q2. Mill production dimensional capabilities improving there. The hot strip mill design is certainly allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades with lower alloyed content and associated alloy cost, and we have already been approved and shipped some API grades. I think experience to-date certainly affirms our technical and process choices, and there is no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace-based flat-rolled steel technology of choice going forward. We continue to grow our exceptional through cyclical operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. We have the four value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines under construction. These projects have gone well, and they are targeted for start-up in the second half of 2023. We have a galvanizing line and paint line going in at Sinton and similarly into Heartland, and we are seeing very good customer interest for that new volume. Currently, we are the largest domestic nonautomotive coater flat rolled steel with and annual coating capacity of over six million tons, these four new lines will increase that capacity by an additional 1.1 million tons. We have created unique supply chain solutions for our customers, which allow our downstream lines to remain always fully utilized with our highest margin products. Switching to aluminum, market response from both current and new customers across all markets has truly been incredible. To recap the project itself the 650,000 metric ton per year aluminum flat roll facility. The main mill facility will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. It is close to the Southeastern markets and well positioned to serve Mexico. It is on the KCS rail line, which connects us again to Mexico to bring slab up and material back down to Mexico and it also connects to Canada to bring primary aluminum down from the sources up there. We intentionally located it on the TVA power grid to allow supply green energy. And we have water access by the Tom Big B waterway. So the transportation structure is good for us. We attained an attractive incentive package and having our current our Columbus steel mill close by. It allows us to draw on that facility for talent or professional services, and there will be a transition or transfer of many of our folks there which will have an immediate infusion of our culture to that aluminum facility. So we are excited about that. The mill itself will have on-site melt slab capacity of roughly 600,000 metric tons and will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. One will be located in the Southwest U.S. and one in SLP Mexico. Both sites, we have - letters have been sent in place, and we are under due diligence, but I believe it will serve us very, very, very well. And obviously, the strategic thought there was to place the slab centers in areas of surplus scrap and the California Western market and Mexico will have an abundance of UBC material. The mill itself, again, is going to be equipped with the two cash lines, the coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We have actually expanded the product scope there to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize recycled content. It is a state-of-the-art facility, and we will be serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both body and TAM, the automotive sector and industrial sectors. Breakdown would be 300,000 tons of can sheet, 200,000 tons of auto and about 150,000 tons of industrial, or the principal equipment is on order, allowing for a pretty firm startup of the mill mid-2025. We believe the Mexican slab center will start up in the second half and the Southwest U.S. slab Center early 2025. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers has grown a little from our initial $2.2 billion estimate. The increase is somewhat associated with - now that we have truly defined the equipment costs. But we have also added scope as I said, we put in a scrap processing and treatment and segregation at both the slab centers, which has increased that number a little and today, we estimate a firm budget of about $2.5 billion. It will be 100% funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. So there is no additional debt or financial needed to push this thing forward. And we clearly expect to see about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, with an additional $40 million to $50 million arising from our recycled Omni Source efforts. From an investment premise and we have talked about it before, but we see the aluminum market, not unlike that in the steel industry, when we started SDI some 30-years ago. It is an industry that has essentially older assets, there has been little reinvestment over the years, heavy legacy cost, there is inefficiency and sort of high-cost operations. And the advantage compared to any other steel market that we have entered is there is actually a supply side deficit. Every other market in steel has always been oversupplied, and we have had to use our culture and low-cost strategies to penetrate those markets. With aluminum, there is a clear, clear supply deficit will certainly aid the ramp-up and a very, very quick profitability of that project. Certainly business alignment, we believe it is sort of an adjacent industry, so to speak. It is going to allow us to leverage our core competencies of constructing design, constructing, ramping up very, very large capital assets. It will allow us to leverage our recycling footprint, Omni Source is the largest North American recycling of nonferrous products, including aluminum. We recycle over GBP 1.2 billion, half of that is aluminum to there. I believe we will certainly be able to infuse the project with our culture, and that will power a very low cost, very high efficiency operations. So we are very, very excited and we are certainly excited from the reception we are getting from those aluminum customers. Looking forward, we are certainly excited and passion by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were recently added to the S&P 500 Index. I feel that is a true testament to our people and to the financial strength and maturity of our company. We are arguably one of the top five steel producers in the world as measured by market cap today and the third largest in North America by capacity and we certainly have the best financial metrics of any of our peers. And all these achievements have been achieved in a relatively short time frame, and that could not be accomplished without the phenomenal commitment of our extraordinary people. Everyone has had an impact and everyone contributes each and every day. We are celebrating our 30th year in business later this year, and there are only better things to come. Our teams and the culture they create on our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. And in turn, we are committed to their wealth firm, their health and their safety. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves and each other is our highest priority each and every day. Our success is also driven by the loyal support of our customers who have become partners and friends over the years and together, we have created many innovative supply chain solutions, creating value for all. And we look forward to providing similar value and optionality to all our new customers as we continue to expand our product offerings in the steel arena, but also in the new aluminum market that we are entering. And finally, thank you to all that have invested in us. There is a growing number that recognizing the power of our culture, the resilience of our business model and the potential outsized depreciation that are significant yet disciplined growth will return. We certainly look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, I would love to open the floor up or the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs. Emily your line is live. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Mark and Theresa and thank your taking my question. I would like to start with the aluminum rolling mill and what progress you have made there. Maybe curious as to how many sort of contract negotiations or discussions you have started to have with different customers. Maybe what end markets you have been targeting so far and as you think about how Steel Dynamics may ultimately disrupt this industry, are there any indications that the pricing construct that we have historically seen of this industry could change. Mark Millett : Thank you good morning and thanks for your question. I do believe that - when one says disrupt an industry that can be taken both positively and negatively. I think from our perspective, we look at it from a very positive nature, creating optionality for the customer base, many of our existing steel customers also buy and consume aluminum and so it is great to be able to create further value for them. I do believe that our advantage and we have seen that over the last 30-years in steel, in that the power of our culture allowing us to leverage state-of-the-art equipment tends to drive very, very effective, highly efficient, low-cost operations and in any commodity any commodity market, the low-cost producer will survive and thrive and allow superior financial metrics through the cycle. And so the mill itself, the combination again of our culture, as stated on the equipment, just simply the plant layout, the high recycled content that we will enjoy the improved yield impact through the process, the low overhead cost all will combine to provide a very low cost solution and allow us to, I think, penetrate those markets quite effectively. Will that change the pricing environment? I don\u2019t think so. We will be just a partial participant initially anyway in that marketplace. Theresa Wagler : From a progress perspective Emily, I think that Mark mentioned earlier that we do have locations that we have in mind and we are negotiating right now for both of the recycled slab facilities plus we now have a location. And so there is a lot of excitement happening in Columbus, Mississippi. Last year, we spent about just a little over $120 million on the investments going forward, just to kind of recalibrate since we do have an increased amount of $2.5 billion. In 2023, we are likely to spend somewhere between $900 million and $950 million in capital, in 2024, $1.2 billion, with the remaining $200 million to $300 million during the startup year of 2025. So the teams are pushing forward very quickly. Emily Chieng : All right. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlos de Alba of Morgan Stanley. Carlos your line is live. Carlos De Alba : Thank you very much Mark and Theresa. So on capacity, I would like to discuss capacity utilization, both for the industry, the company as well as the expected ramp-up of the fourth value-added current lines. So you guys have been running as you described in earlier comments at a higher capacity the decision in the industry. But now the industry in the U.S. is running around just slightly above 70%, 75%. How long can this persist, do you think, given that prices are increasing, supply discipline has been there so far. But there are some folks out there that are doing as well as you clearly by the numbers that you have posted. So how do you see the situation evolving Mark perhaps on these? And then in Mark, how do you see the ramp-up - the expected ramp-up of the capacity utilization of the four value-added lines. You mentioned that you see 80% in 2023 for Sinton, but any color on the fourth order lines would be great. Mark Millett : Thank you Carlos, you were like a machine gun there. So I\u2019m not so sure I got all your questions. I think from a ramp-up, I will work backwards, but from the ramp-up of the coating lines, those will be, I think, very, very, very strong. Obviously, we have many, many galvanizing lines, prepaint lines throughout the company, and we will harness all our technical resources there to get those lines up quickly. We certainly have the substrate available to fully load those lines. So I think the ramp up, again, those lines of start up at second half, perhaps fourth quarter and will ramp up quite quickly through the rest of the year into the following year. Theresa Wagler : As it relates to the first part of your question, Carlos, around utilization for the industry. I would point out that even if you go back to more challenging times like 2015, et cetera, our utilization still remained very high, and that is because of the power of our pull-through volume, which we would anticipate as well. But we are really optimistic for 2023 with the additional on shoring of manufacturing businesses, which you are seeing in reality as well as with the infrastructure program and other investment opportunities. We think that steel demand in the U.S. will continue to stay steady to potentially increasing as well as the trade benefits of melting and casting in the U.S. for the U.S. producer. So yes, flat-rolled prices specifically have improved recently, which we think that they should have. We don\u2019t think that, that is going to have a negative impact. We think that will be a positive impact, and we think both industry utilization rates and ours specifically, should remain steady to improving in 2023. Carlos De Alba : All right. Great. Thank you very much Mark and Theresa. I\u2019m sorry Mark I will slowdown next time. Operator : Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners of Wolfe Research. Timna your line is live. Timna Tanners : Hey good morning guys. I wanted to ask about the downstream, the fabricate segment please. Just a little clarity, if you could, on the guidance. As I understand it, you talked about some slippage from very high levels, but still above historical levels. But historically, EBITDA per ton prior to 2022 is $190 a ton, and 2022 is $2,850. I\u2019m just wondering if you could provide a little more color on where we should fall between those two extremes. And maybe if you could, it would be helpful. I know Nucor mentioned a year-over-year comparison? Or if there is anything that you can provide a little more clarity on that, that would be great. Mark Millett : I think one has to recognize that the industry has gone through quite a consolidation comparing it to some years ago and that has allowed sort of market strength or strong market pricing compared to history, and that will continue. The year as it is unfolding, we are entering the year with an absolute solid backlog through the middle of the year for sure. The order input rate is indeed off the kind of the frenetic crazy pace that it was 12-months ago. But it is very, very, very solid, and we believe that it is going to be a very, very good year for us at year-end. And I believe there is some concern maybe as I said earlier, the macro indices may not look as rosy as some would think. And some believe that there is economic uncertainty out there, as I hopefully articulated, we don\u2019t see the gloom and doom that everyone else is seeing it. Our order input rates across all our sectors with the 1 exception, a little off on residential is solid. And our December bookings record level on a historic basis similarly year-to-date. So we just see strength through the year through our lands through our order book. Timna Tanners : Okay. Mark, does that strength on volumes, strengthen prices into margins I mean do you expect year-over-year to be up and just like I\u2019m saying it is a big gap. I get that it will be higher than it is been historically, but any color on if we should expect some continuation of what we saw in 2022? Mark Millett : Well, I think the steel space will -- I know I\u2019m saying that the steel space will appreciate from the lows. Obviously, we are seeing the hot-band pricing off the market pricing of 650 and it is up away over 700. In fabrication, the spreads will likely come off a little. They certainly haven\u2019t to any large extent at this point. You are certainly seeing people say, well, our projects are getting delayed, we are not seeing any cancellations at all. We are seeing projects delayed some. But in my mind, it is not an unhealthy thing in all honesty, because it is just protracting or extending the cycle -- the business cycle in that arena. Timna Tanners : Okay, thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth of Credit Suisse. Curt your line is live. Curtis Woodworth : Yes, thanks good morning, Mark and Theresa, how are you? Good. I just want to follow up on the fabrication comments. So in the past, you have talked about you have had backlog basically priced through the middle part of this year, and I think you had discussed I believe pricing in the 5,000 or higher level. So I just wondered if you could confirm that, that is kind of the price level your backlog is at. And then if you are sold through the first part of this year, I assume you are bidding projects now for can you comment on price levels you see there? And then with respect to some of the delays or project push outs from what we have seen, the data center and some of those areas are still very strong oil the Amazon type warehouse spent a lot of those have been canceled. So if you could just kind of help us maybe understand a little bit of the DNA of the backlog would be helpful. Theresa Wagler : Good morning Curt. So from the perspective of pricing, Obviously, we are not going to give specific pricing. But you would have seen that the pricing held in very steadily in the fourth quarter from an average perspective. And we have seen very steady pricing in the backlog as well. So I would err on the higher side if you think about what is in the backlog. And that is why we have great confidence in the earnings resiliency of the fabrication business through at least the first half of this year. And the order backlog, it is an interesting question because it is broadened out, wherein as it was very concentrated in warehouses, it is broadened out now into more, I would say, infrastructure type hospitals, schools, churches et cetera, so that is a good thing and that is what we think we are seeing more of. We expected very strong volumes for fabrication in 2023 from what we are seeing so far. And Mark mentioned the order entry activity is very good from a historical. So then you can contemplate what you think steel prices will be to make an estimation of whether you think we will continue to see expanding spreads in fabrication or not. That is what we saw in the fourth quarter definitively. Mark, do you want to add anything? Mark Millett : And just the one comment, though, I think it was mentioned that the distribution warehouses are again canceled. We actually are only seeing that in one customer. Well, actually, not a customer of ours, but one company the distribution warehouse business in our backlog is solid and not getting canceled out. So that is not a comprehensive issue. And just to reemphasize what Teresa said on earlier on the reshoring. Reshoring is real. It truly is. That is going to be supportive of that business. And if you look through just the size of some of these factories, the battery manufacturing facilities is a huge, massive, massive facilities that will require a lot of joists and deck. So again, it is off the frenetic pace that we saw, but it is a very, very, very solid sector for us for the rest of the year. Curtis Woodworth : Okay. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up on Sinton. What were the volumes shipped this quarter and we look at start-up costs for the year is roughly $430 million. So those material drag on your profitability. Can you comment on maybe when you would expect to maybe breakeven with respect to start-up costs and do you have any guidance for what start-up impact would look like in the first quarter? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Yes. So from a volume perspective Curt, Sinton had shipments in the third quarter of around just under 270,000 tons, and it increased to just under 340,000 tons for shipments in the fourth quarter, and we expect to see that improve in the first quarter and then have a significant improvement in the second quarter of 2023. From an impact, we still expect to see losses as they work through the higher-priced pigeon which is obviously matching against lower steel prices than they were at this time last year. And so like it will be -- it should improve over the fourth quarter losses pretty significantly, but still be higher than we would like to see maybe around the $10 million mark. Curtis Woodworth : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser of BNP Paribas. Tristan your line is live. Tristan Gresser : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just a quick follow-up on Sinton. Are you able to share any EBITDA annual contribution you are expecting for next year or maybe kind of a sense of how this compares versus the normalized EBITDA target you mentioned and given maybe a slower start-up and then some ramp-up of the coating lines as well in Q4 that is going to help. So any kind of a sense you can give us that would be great. Theresa Wagler : So I think Mark mentioned the ramp-up for the two additional value-add lines that will be in Sinton the third quarter of 2023. Those should ramp, we expect fairly quickly to start benefiting their product mix. We are not going to give full-year guidance for Sinton as far as EBITDA. But I would tell you that I think Curt mentioned earlier on the call, that the losses in 2022 were over $400 million, and it is going to swing to a significant positive for 2023. So just that differential alone will have a significant momentum benefit to our earnings in 2023, but it is just too early for us to give an estimate, but it won\u2019t hit through cycle EBITDA in the year where we are still ramping up production. Tristan Gresser : Okay. That is really helpful. And my second question is more on the demand side. You talked about steel demand increasing in 2023. Can you give us a sense of what kind of number you are seeing and maybe diving into your key end markets also there if you are able to share some quantitative number that would be great. Mark Millett : I guess from our perspective, the higher demand translates to, in large part, to price up point and spread support. Our operations are already running at quite a high utilization rate. Further demand, obviously, is certainly going to help our Sinton facility. And given the market sectors, energy is very, very strong in that area in Texas. That is helping us. And the challenges that we are seeing in Mexico and the imports of sheet coming up from Mexico into the Southwest markets, but also even under the Midwest have essentially mitigate they are staying in Mexico now. So that is going to create good demand and great dynamics. So from a market perspective, we will certainly be able to support all the capability that the ramp-up will allow. Tristan Gresser : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. Andreas your line is live. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you very much. Just one question for me. Just switching gears a little bit over to the long steel segment, what are you seeing there in terms of potential new orders coming in from the infrastructure bill, the IRA. Are you seeing anything yet there? We have obviously seen rebar is kind of coming down for the last six, seven months. It doesn\u2019t feel like the infrastructure build is kind of abating yet. But what are you seeing on your side to kind of stop the rebar price decline? Mark Millett : Well, as we have suggested in the past, we are not big in the rebar markets in at. But nonetheless, from our structural long products perspective, the infrastructure bill or spending is not necessarily kicked in yet. It typically takes six to nine months for that to materialize. And obviously, it is too soon. But come the summer of this year, I think you will start to see some benefit there. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Got it. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you Mark. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder of BofA Securities. Lawson your line is live. Lawson Winder : Hi. Good morning Mark. Good morning Theresa, thank you for today\u2019s call. Maybe could I ask about the dividend outlook and just kind of get your thoughts on return of capital. So last year, you bumped the dividend quite substantially. And this year, you have expressed some confidence in symptom and Sinton wasn\u2019t contributing, in fact, was a drag in 2022 so maybe just kind of your thoughts around 2023. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Good one. I\u2019m smiling because Mark tosses things my way, and it is funny how he does it. But from a dividend perspective, we do like to grow the dividend in a way that is consistent so that we are constantly having increases across the spectrum. And I think as I mentioned, since 2017, we actually increased the dividend by almost 120%. And we like to do that lockstep with free cash flow increases that are through cycle like Sinton. I would expect that we should have a pretty significant increase coming forward as well. We like to do those traditionally in the first quarter time frame. We have additional projects that are a little bit smaller, but that are coming online in 2023 that will add to through-cycle earnings. And given our stock price, which has been fantastic, driving up recently, you should expect to see strong shareholder distributions continue, and that would include a strong increase in the dividend coming forward. Lawson Winder : Okay, fantastic. Thank you. Congratulations. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from John Tumazos, of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John your line is live. John Tumazos : Thank you. I try to keep a little spread on non-scrap cost of goods sold per ton just taking your total corporate revenues per ton and pretax per ton and subtracting scrap profits and it peaked a year ago at 673 and was only 4.56% this quarter. Are the bigger contributors to that the much lower price of purchased steel for your galvanizing and painting, et cetera, divisions first, lower profit sharing improvement in the Sinton mill as it ramps up, and hopefully, it will be the lowest cost when it is four and maybe a mix shift into some. So please explain - by the way, Nucor\u2019s non-scrap cost of goods sales went up and were the highest in the last two-years in the current quarter. So there is the opposite direction, but that is a separate problem to figure out. Mark Millett : John, great to have you on the call as always, and thanks for the question. I think the biggest parameter is substrate costs. As we have -- over the years, we have ramped up the tech substrate, Holland substrate and even at Sinton, we actually pre-purchased about 150,000 tons, maybe a little more to load the downstream coating lines in preparation for when the hot mill started up. So you are certainly seeing that influence our costs, for sure. Theresa Wagler : And the other thing that you hit, John, was spot on as well. It has to do with mix. So if you think about the increase in the impact from our fabrication business, that we would have had some change in that as well. So I think it is both mix and what Mark talked about is the steel substrate. John Tumazos : In your steel mills, with the normal non-scrap cost of goods sold be closer to $200 a ton or $250 tons or $300 tons. Mark Millett : We have always tried to not share that information, John. So I would prefer to stay that way. I would tell you though that, one, our conversion cost is probably as good as anyone in the world. And number two, the people don\u2019t necessarily recognize the offsetting sort of efficiency or effectiveness of volume. So on our process lines, carbonizing lines prepaint lines, even though some of the input costs have appreciated, the fact that our teams continually just improve productivity, put more volume through offsetting the sort of the overhead and the fixed costs. Our actual processing costs on those lines have been sort of almost stagnant for the last, I don\u2019t know, how many years. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. There appears to be no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Thank you and thank you for everyone on the call for your time today. Certainly, thanks to our team. I want to remind each and every one of you that you do contribute, you do have an impact on our success and stay safe and keep each other safe. Customers, we can do it without you. And I would just like to reemphasize those that have invested in us, there is a growing cadre of folks that are building positions that - they really are recognizing the power of our culture. It is different. We are different, and we drive absolutely different results. Our business model allows us to perform and maintain a higher through-cycle cash generation than our peers. And I think hopefully, people are starting to recognize that that our capital allocation, our growth is incredibly disciplined, particularly on the acquisition side. And I think that that speaks to just our underlying results. It is interesting if one measures the earnings power of our company on an employee basis, we are substantially higher than anyone else out there in our peer group. And again, it speaks to our overall efficiency and effectiveness of the culture, the strategic decisions that the team has made over the years, and it will continue to drop to the bottom line. So investors that support us, again, many, many thanks to you as well and with that said, have a great day. Operator : Again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

Please be advised this call is being recorded today, April 20, 2023, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic condition. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the internet at www.sec.gov, and is applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics reports first quarter 2023 results. And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. We certainly appreciate you all joining us for our first quarter earnings call today. As you read, once again our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. It was highlighted by most importantly, a consecutive quarter of significant safety improvement. 82% of our facilities were incident free and most importantly, our piece of focus appears to be minimizing severity rate. We had record steel shipments of 3.3 million tons and adjusted EBITDA generation of a strong $950 million. Sinton's performance is showing improvement with a clear path to profitability in the second quarter '23 given the expectation of increased volumes. And we are also making great progress on our aluminum flat rolled investment. There's great excitement within the prospective customer base for a new and innovative supply chain solution. As always, I'm incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company and they drive our success. It is their culture of excellence and the intentional diversification of our product portfolio that allows us to maintain higher utilization rates and maximize opportunities, resulting in higher lows and higher highs through all market cycles and producing superior financial metrics. However, for safety, great financial performance is of no import without having our team safe. Often, employees are described as a company's most important resource. But for us, for Steel Dynamics they're more than that, they're family. And now we number over 12,000 strong. We're focused to provide the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation at every level of the organization. With that focus, as I mentioned, the teams safety performance further improved in the first quarter '23. But there's more to do, and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries throughout our organization. So with that said, and before I pursue the quarter, Theresa. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, everyone. It's great to join you. I had my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong operational and financial performance this quarter. Our first quarter 2023 net income was $637 million or $3.70 per diluted share, which includes costs of about $77 million, or $0.31 per diluted share associated with the startup of our Sinton Texas flat-rolled steel mill. Excluding those costs, first quarter 2023 adjusted net income was $691 million or $4.01 per diluted share. First quarter 2023 revenues of $4.9 billion were slightly higher than sequential fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume and increased metals recycling prices. Our first quarter operating income of $835 million was 10% higher than fourth quarter results driven by record steel volume. As we discussed our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2023 and beyond, and we're focused toward a continued transformational growth initiative. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $345 million in the first quarter. As record shipments of 3.3 million tons were partially offset by lower realized selling values. I also want to say congratulations to our structural and rail division, as they had another record earnings quarter supported by a strong construction market. Our flat-rolled steel mills were negatively impacted during the quarter with high cost pig iron that was purchased in early 2022 during the early stages of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Based on current pig iron prices, earnings were impacted by approximately $50 million in the first quarter, but we have worked through that higher priced inventory now. Operating income from more metals recycling operations was $43 over threefold fourth quarter results due to increased demand, driving higher prices and volume. Our Mexican recycling operations have proven to be a strategic key for both sourcing scrap for our southern steel mills and driving profitability. Thanks to the Zimmer and Roka teams. We appreciate you. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing operating model benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations by providing higher quality scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and by reducing companywide working capital requirements. Our steel fabrication operations achieved strong operating income in the quarter of $551 million, but lower than record fourth quarter results due primarily to seasonally lower shipments. Steel joists and deck demand remains very strong as evidenced by continued robust order activity. Specifically, our March order activity was extraordinarily strong. This is resulting in a strong order backlog extending into October and November of 2023. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong throughout the year, including the second half. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. At March 31, we had record liquidity of $3.5 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $2.3 billion, and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During the first quarter of 2023, we generated cash from operations of $734 million. We spent approximately $226 million on capital expenditures. We believe for the full-year of 2023, capital investments will be in the range of $1.5 billion, the majority of which relates to our aluminum flat-roll mill investments. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow and aligned with our growth strategy. We also purchased $354 million of our common stock, representing approximately 2% of our outstanding shares. At March 31, $980 million remained authorized for repurchase under our new plan. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $4.5 billion of our common stock, representing over 30% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and the consistently strong cash flow generation capability. We continue to be optimistic and confident in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $580 million to today's average of $2.6 billion. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with our unchanged capital allocation philosophy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distribution as we have clearly demonstrated. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We are committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we will remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint facility could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. And I want to specifically thank the biocarbon solutions team in Columbus, Mississippi that are doing a fantastic job and we still hope to start operating this facility in early 2024. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than what may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and to play a leadership role moving forward. Before I hand the call back to Mark, for those of you that keep specific track of our flat-rolled shipments in the first quarter, we had hot-rolled and P&O shipments of 1,006,000. We had cold-rolled shipments of 132,000 and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. Mark? Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. Although there was some seasonality in shipping volume for fabrication, we saw yet another strong quarter driven by the sustained market strength and an absolutely extraordinary execution by our team. Productivity of our operations is incredible. So thank you for all for the great job you all are doing up there. We continue to have high expectations for the fabrication business. We believe non-residential construction markets will continue to be robust in the coming years. Non-residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong throughout '23 and related spending has been significantly higher so far in '23 compared to last year at this time. There'll be continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and infrastructure spending programs should provide momentum for additional incremental construction spending. More real time, our customers tell us demand remains solid, as confirmed by strong order entry rates, especially the most recent March order activity. Steel fabrication order backlog as Theresa suggested, extends seven to eight months into October, November with strong pricing dynamics. Not only a significant contributor onto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel price. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong first quarter. Congratulations to them. They are on a path to higher volumes and increased metal margin. After seven consecutive months of declining pricing in '22 ferrous scrap prices improved in December and throughout the first quarter. Increasing well over a $100 per gross ton. We expect scrap pricing to remain fairly steady at these higher levels based on increased seasonal North American steel mill demand in Q2 and Q3. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our growing Mexican volumes enhance our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. It will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is working closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. Our low residual shred 1 is just one example of that. The impact of these efforts, along with others in the industry is demonstrated that innovation will provide ample ferrous and nonferrous scrap supply in the years ahead. Our steel operations achieved record quarterly shipments of 3.3 million tons and solid financial results in the first quarter. Steel production utilization rate excluding Sinton was 94% compared to a domestic industry rate of 75%. Our higher utilization rates are clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles. Value-added diversified product offerings provide broad optionality across all market segments. Enhanced supply chain solutions is driving customer preference and were supported by the internal pull through manufacturing volume. Our higher through cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, customer order entry is good and backlogs are solid. March in particular was a very strong booking month for the steel platform. Auto is solid. Auto production is expected to increase in '23 over '22 rates and dealer inventories have improved but still remain below historical norms. Build rate in '22 was some 14.3 million units, and we expect '23 to show 15.1 and a little higher in '24. Nonresidential construction remains strong, as evidenced by strong fabrication backlog and long product steel volumes. Our long products are seasonally solid from a backlog perspective and onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. Residential construction has softened to some degree, but that erosion appears to be easing a little, but that segment tends to be a small part of our overall portfolio. Oil and gas activity is very strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and line pipe and solar continues to grow appreciably. At Sinton, we produced 420,000 tons of hot band in the quarter, which is 56% of eventual capacity. Fifth and daily records were achieved in March, clearly demonstrating the mill's ability to reach the 3 million tons. As we discussed in our first quarter call, production through the quarter was impacted by certain supply chain issues related to bearings and rolls needed for the caster. This issue has now been resolved, and we expect a significant advance in productivity and earnings in Q2 and we should see the mill being EBITDA positive in Q2 for sure. We believe full-year capacity utilization could be in the range of 80% of rated capacity. The team has clearly demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas Steel Mill. Full product dimensional capability has been proven. We have gone down to 50-ish and all the way up to one inch and all the way out to 84 inch width. The customers are reporting that the surface quality is absolutely exceptional. The hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, which allows the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content with a significant reduction in production cost. Grade 80, Grade 100 has been achieved and we've already been approved and shipped some API grades. In my mind, this affirms our technical and process choices. And there's no doubt that this is the next generation electric arc furnace flat rolled steel technology of choice. We certainly have gained strong market acceptance. Commercially, we can sell everything we make and then some. With the Caster segment issue resolved, we're able now to fully lever our heavy gauge wide capability. Our onsite customers are busy with two of them already expanding their capabilities. Our exceptional through-cycle operating financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, the market response from both current and new customers across our targeted market segments has been incredible. But to recap the project, that's a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility that will be located in Columbus, Mississippi. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors reproduces roughly 300,000 metric tons of can sheet, 200,000 metric tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial alloy. On-site melt cast slab capacity will be 600,000 metric tons, and that'll be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers, one in Central Mexico. We've already purchased the property there, and we're pursuing a Southwest U.S. site as we speak. Technology will include two cast lines, coating lines, and dense stream processing and packaging. We've expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycle content. All the principal equipment is already on order, and we expect the roller mill to start up mid-'25, the Mexico Slab Center second half of '24 and the Southwest Slab Center probably the first quarter of '25. Total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is expected to be $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with available cash and cash flow from operations. As we've said in the past, the expectation is to add somewhere between $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA for the aluminum project, plus likely $40 million to $50 million for Omni. I think it's a very, very compelling investment premise. We see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It's predominantly owed assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs is inefficient with high cost operations. A significant aluminum flat roll supply deficit exists in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. There is business alignment, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction strength and operational know how and also lever Omni's recycling footprint as Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler today. SDI culture will drive high efficiency and low cost and throughout the industry, there's a very steep cost curve which is going to support margin, a very, very cost effective, high return growth initiative. We're excited and impassioned by our future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in '22. We are arguably one of the top five steel producers in the world as measured by market cap and the third largest in North America relative to capacity. All these achievements in a relatively short time frame. We celebrate our 30th year in our business in '23 and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and we are committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business, providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, in turn mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. And we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the many years ahead. So, with that all said, I'd like to open the floor up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Emily Chieng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is live. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Thank you for taking my questions this morning. I wanted to ask a bit about the fabrication volume expectation there and just trying to take a look at the 1Q number. It certainly was a little weaker than anticipated. You mentioned that there was some seasonality and some customer supply chain constraints there. Can you provide some color as to what they were? And how we move past this and anything you'd highlight as we look forward to the rest of the year as to what that volume trajectory could look like? Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Emily. It's a great question. And there was seasonality in the first quarter, but there was also some movement because some of the customers are experiencing supply chain constraints as it relates to construction labor and as it relates to materials. And so it's just simply pushing out orders. It's not changing the entirety of the volume itself. So the order backlog with some of these projects has actually pushed out even further than into that October, November time frame. So it's a shifting of volume, I guess is how I would phrase it. As Mark mentioned, and I mentioned in my notes as well, March was an extraordinary order entry for our steel and joists deck business. And that really is, I think a testament to the strength of that market today. And if you think about the benefits that are kind of outside of just normal construction arena, if you think about manufacturing that has momentum behind it because of the Inflation Reduction Act, because of the infrastructure program, manufacturing onshoring et cetera, we really expect our fabrication business to experience very strong volumes this year as it's supported by those extraneous additional tailwinds, if you will. Emily Chieng : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth from Credit Suisse. Your line is live. Curt Woodworth : Thank you. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. A follow-up question on fabrication as well for me. In the past, you've talked about backlog pricing in the $5,000 per ton level. We've been hearing that price has definitely come in a lot from kind of peak levels last year. So I just wanted to get a sense for if you could comment on pricing you're seeing in the market. And then you talked about the March order entry being very good. Can you give us a sense of what the makeup of that backlog or that order entry is? And then if you give any comments on EBITDA per ton expectations? Theresa Wagler : Curt, you're trying to be tricky. You know, we won't give EBITDA per ton, but I appreciate you trying. As it relates to the order activity, to give you a sense of it, it was well more than double the order activity that we've seen kind of in the more recent time frame, January, February, December time frame. So it was incredibly robust. And most of that activity came from what I'm going to call industrial and manufacturing related business. So I think one needs to keep in mind when people talk about nonresidential construction, I think they like to hone in on office space. And there's many other categories as it relates to what would impact steel joists and deck demand. And that's where we're seeing a lot of momentum. So that order activity for us is very much focused on those larger projects. And I think that's where the funding from those projects, a lot of the times are actually already funded. They're not bank funded, but they're project oriented funding from large corporations themselves or now there's public funding support as it relates to decarbonization efforts and the Department of Energy and the excess funds that will be coming in those arenas as well. So there's a lot of extra things, I think that will support the volume going forward. But for us, it's primarily in that industrial manufacturing base at this point in time. As it relates to pricing, the commercial teams would be very upset with me. Barry is laughing, if I were to try to give any commercial guidance at this point, I would tell you that as we've said in the past, the average price in the entirety of the order backlog is still very high from a historic perspective. It's not at the peak pricing that we saw, but it's very much aligned with what we have seen for the entirety of last year as an average. Curt Woodworth : Okay, that's helpful. Mark Millett : And just for clarity, when we say that the backlog isn't peak pricing, the sustained backlog, that's kind of extending out is at very, very, very good past pricing. The new pricing coming in, as you mentioned, is off a little from that for sure, but relative to a historic basis, it is way, way higher than historic norm. Curt Woodworth : Okay, and then just a quick follow-up on Sinton, as we think about that asset running 56% utilization, but having a net loss of $70 million. We would think that given where metal spreads are today, if that asset could be 70% utilized in the second quarter, it theoretically should make a lot of money, right, but it seems like there's still some kind of lingering startup issues, and you talked about some of the supply chain constraints. So can you help us understand a little bit about maybe the earnings power of that asset later this year or any frame of reference in terms of 2Q, in terms of what you think utilization rates could look like? Thank you. Mark Millett : Certainly. Great question. I'd say if you look at the first quarter and certainly the fourth quarter, you had -- you might say a couple of extraneous impacts from a cost perspective. We obviously have higher price pig iron coming through, given our order early last year, second quarter of last year with the Russia and Ukraine sort of crisis. So that is peeling out now through the first quarter and a little bit in April. In anticipation of early startup of the downstream lines, we bought substrate, and again, that was at higher pricing, and that had to come through the system, and that is essentially sort of out of the system today. So we were carrying that sort of burden in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter, and some of it will come into the second, but it's substantially reduced. Obviously, the main principal driver is volume. Volume, volume, volume drives the successful performance of any major capital asset, and certainly a startup asset such as this. We were at 56%. And our confidence in the technology, I think at least for me, is driven by windows of absolute amazing performance. Where we've had shifts, we've had weeks. We're at 75%, 80% of capability already. If you look at sequence lengths, which we and our industry for sure is an indication of the effectiveness of the teams and the equipment. We're averaging, I think a little over 13 heats sequence. We've been as high as 22 heats, 23 heats, and each heat is whatever 200, 210 tons per heat. My mind amplifies the capability of the asset. We just have to get the reliability of all the equipment. And again, as you know, Curt, it's in line. So the melt shop, the ladle furnace, the caster, the rock and mill, the finishing mill, everything has to be running in unison. And we're getting there with the segment bearing and role issue behind us, not hindering us. I think we're looking for a sort of a step function improvement here in the next month or two. Theresa Wagler : Just as a reminder, on through cycle basis, we still believe very strongly that sitting, when it has four of the value added lines operating, we'll have a through cycle EBITDA in the range of $450 to $500 million per year. So that outlook hasn't changed. So it is a significant benefit long-term. It's just a matter of this year. Curt Woodworth : Okay. Thanks. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is live. Carlos De Alba : Great. Thank you. I'm just going to try it in a different way without maybe discussing the absolute levels. It is clear that the EBITDA per ton and the profitability of the fabrication business is extraordinary relative to history. It actually started based on what I've seen before the pandemic, but it exploded throughout the pandemic and it has remained at those levels. How do you see the normalization relative to say 2019 or 2017 to '19 average? Do you expect to be able to sustain a significantly higher profitability relative to that '17 to '19 average, even if it is lower than what we're experiencing today? I mean you probably understand that we're trying to figure it out what is a much more normal potential run rate of profitability in that business, just given how extraordinary the results have been? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Carlos. Thanks. I know everyone's trying to figure that out. And what I would say to that is, yes, we do believe that going forward, we're going to have -- there has been a structural shift and change in how the commercial aspect of the steel joist and deck business has materialized in the last two years, if I would say it that way. And the change is that, first of all, there's considerable volume and we believe that demand is going to stay in place for a considerable amount of time. There's limited supply. So in today's environment, and I think in the future environment, it's not so much as looking at just a product itself. But this is a highly engineered product, so it's looking at a product as well as a service. And that service is requiring time on the mill or time in the facility itself. And that has a value. And that's what now has come to the force that the customers understand there's a time element and a service element, as well as a very highly engineered product set. So we believe those are structural changes. And I think that that came to bear and was proven in the second half of 2022 when steel prices actually were being reduced pretty significantly. And we think an overcorrection. And yet we had increasing pricing within our steel joist and deck facilities themselves. So we do believe there's a structural change. I can't help you more than that. I would tell you that we expect very strong volumes this year to be comparable to last year. And I think that we've told you we've got an order backlog that goes out into October, November, and it has a significantly higher price. And that price is not too far off of what the average pricing would have been for 2022. So I think we've given you a lot of data points to hopefully help you with your estimates. Carlos De Alba : That's great color, Theresa. Thank you very much. And if I may squeeze one more, maybe Mark, could you comment as to how you see right now obviously, that could change. But right now, how do you see the ramp up profile in terms of capacity utilization of the flat-rolled ali project? Mark Millett : Slowly, I think the -- again, as I said earlier, I'm expecting a step function improvement in the second. I'm sorry. Carlos De Alba : Yes, the ali, the aluminum project. Yes, Sinton you mentioned. Yes. Mark Millett : I would suggest that it's and that's a great question in honesty, because we're wrestling with that. Ourselves right now to be honest, and trying to understand fully the -- some of the approval certification process of can sheet as opposed to auto sheet. The fact that we're creating slab ahead of time will aid that, and the fact that we have on the automotive side some very, very good relationships with two or three key auto producers that are seeking our aluminum. And I think that will accelerate that certification process. So, from the standpoint of actual ramp, it would imagine it wouldn't be too much different than you would expect for any facility. Sort of 50% for the first 12 months, 80% for the second 12 months, and then ramping up thereafter. That would be probably as good estimation as I would suggest to you. Carlos De Alba : Great. Thank you very much, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning, everyone. Wanted to start off and ask a little bit more color on garage doors. I know you have a great position in garage doors and also on the warehousing side, if you could provide some more color on those end markets? Mark Millett : Certainly garage door is off a little, Timna, for sure, in concert or in parallel with the residential erosion. But typically, as you see -- typically as you see the housing market come off. You see the replacement business go up. So it's not one for one, but it is off a little bit. The warehouse market. I think when you're talking about warehouse market, I'm assuming you're looking at the sort of distribution warehouse type facilities. Timna Tanners : All right. Mark Millett : Obviously there's been a lot of focus on the fact that Amazon overbuilt. Amazon wasn't a principal customer of ours. The other warehouse distribution organizations are not off to that same degree. That said, cloud computing pharma is very, very, very strong. And as Theresa mentioned, you're starting to see true sort of reshoring sort of industrial manufacturing growth, the Tesla's of the world, the battery facilities, that sort of thing. Timna Tanners : Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. I wanted to follow-up on sitting a little bit to think about the cadence of when we're going to see some of these mix shifts or improvement in the mix with the value add. So just I know you talked about the galv lines coming on, and I also wanted to think about when we might see some more inroads into auto, given your ability to make the thicker slabs and perhaps penetrate that market earlier than other Minnie mills. Can you talk a little bit more about when we should start to see, first, the galvanized capacity ramp up within sitting and also the potential for penetrating exposed auto in the next several years? Mark Millett : We're really excited with the ramp up of the galvanizing down at Sinton. We do have to feed our paint lines right now, so we are working automotive discussions and trials into our production plants, but we're also anxious on making sure the whole plants operational. All these units starting together. We want to feed the paint line, we want to feed our broader range of customers in the galvanized. We're really excited about the capabilities that we've seen in the galv line itself, paired with our technology on the hot side. So we are excited about the surface quality especially. That was one of the big decision makers for us. And to this point, we're really excited. We have not begun actually putting material into automotive plants, but we're engaging with customers that have entrusted our future with them and they're excited they come to the shop and they see a path. So our technical teams are very much in discussions there and very much complemented with our Columbus operations that are doing the workhorse of the automotive today. So we're excited to see it, and I think it has to happen at a pace that technical people are comfortable with, so that we can -- once we earn that business, we can entrust it with them that we're going to be shipping a good product into them. And obviously, Timna, the -- my watch has gone off, sorry? My ears are such that I don't hear high pitched voices. Well, definitely voices, but any sound. So if you heard my watch alarm, I apologize. But Timna, I think the auto penetration is going as planned, though. And if you look at the strength of our business model, the strength of Sinton itself, it's a very, very, very diversified product portfolio. And we can leverage different market segments and give us greater optionality. So currently the energy is incredibly strong. OCTG market line pipe is strong, and that will continue. I think, for the rest of this year, going into the next year, particularly with the infrastructure build out. And we're seeing actually, and it's surprising us a little bit, perhaps, but the energy markets for heavy plate or heavier plate, heavier products anyway, that we produce at any of our other mills, that is something that we're starting to leverage, particularly now we've got the caster issue behind us and can go up to full 1-inch thick. So we can sort of dance and work through or work around the different market segments. To be honest, that's the strength of Sinton. It's the strength of all of our flat-rolled facilities. Timna Tanners : If I could sneak one in on Sinton. I forgot to ask about the Mexican exports. I've been hearing, actually, that's been a big advantage for sitting in and other mills in the south. Do you think that's more sticky than taking a share from AMSA being closed, or how much do you expect that could stick, assuming AMSA restarts? Mark Millett : Well, I think the AMSA situation certainly is aided both not just the Mexican market, but the U.S. market, because Mexican output and capability has been sort of focused or redirected squarely within the Mexican market itself. So that's helped us. I think the customer base of AMSA is when you go through a shockwave like this, you sort of reflect on your future. And I think they see a need for optionality. But even when AMSA comes back, I think we're confident, in all honesty, of maintaining a lot of that business. So it's been very fortuitous for us. Timna Tanners : Makes sense. Okay. Thanks for the detail. Mark Millett : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas Exane. Your line is live. Tristan Gresser : Yes, hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first one, and I apologize, it's again about the fabrication outlook. You flagged that you're targeting volumes of last year. So strong volumes, is that fair then to assume a strong pickup than in volumes into Q2? And also the second part to that question is maybe on the moving pieces there for the outlook. It's also on the cost side, can you discuss a little bit the cost side there especially into Q2? I mean, we've seen flat steel prices double over the past month. The backlog is kind of locked. So anything you can say there in terms of potential cost pressure into Q2 that would be helpful. Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Tristan for the question. Yes, as it relates to volume, I mean traditionally, you're always going to have your strongest construction months and project months and quarters in the second and third quarter. So we absolutely would expect to see stronger volumes in that time frame for our fabrication business, as well. As it relates to cost, we generally sometimes it changes, but we generally keep around eight weeks or so of steel on the ground for our fabrication business, uniquely, we use primarily flat rolled steels, a little bit of merchant steels in the process. So if you can kind of follow that bouncy ball with how you feel the pricing will look going forward and what's done in the recent past, and that should give you some inclination of how the metal margin will move pushing forward into the second quarter. Tristan Gresser : All right, that's helpful. So the price increase we've seen has not been reflected at all. Theresa Wagler : Yes, it lags about eight -- it would lag around eight to 10 weeks. Tristan Gresser : All right. Mark Millett : I want to emphasize the obvious here, because we all tend to sometimes focus near-term, but the New Millennium fabrication business as a whole is incredibly important, A, for pull-through volume, particularly in softer markets, as we said earlier, allowing the higher utilization rate through our steel mill. But it's also in this environment, maybe as steel pricing comes up, you get a little bit of squeeze and vice versa on the other side, opposite side. But there's a very strong natural hedge to our business here, and we've been very intentional with our growth into sort of value add, sort of diversification of our portfolio and the businesses that we grow to try and mitigate that volatility of through-cycle cash generation and not be as cyclical as we once were maintaining higher highs and higher lows, for sure. Tristan Gresser : Okay, that makes sense. And maybe a quick follow-up on working capital, we've seen quite a good release in Q1, how would you see that evolve moving forward? Theresa Wagler : Yes, so as we talked about it, there was a lot, there was a significant amount of working capital build in 2022. Much of that was not structural. It had to do with us layering on some additional raw materials with pig iron, some additional substrate that Mark mentioned. So we have been able to work through most, if not all of that. We still expect to have some working capital give back as we head into the second quarter, as we kind of still right size some of our inventory levels, et cetera. So it may not be as significant of a benefit as you've seen in the last two quarters, but we definitely think working capital will be a funding source heading into the second quarter. Tristan Gresser : Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Andreas Bokkenheuser from UBS. Your line is live. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions for me. One on steel and one on ali. On steel, you're very obviously growing your volumes both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, and it certainly looks to be faster than the market. So you guys seem to be capturing market share. Assuming you agree with that, can you give us a little bit of color on where specifically you're capturing market share from peers? Is it non-res? Is it autos? Is it energy, possibly all of the above. But is anything kind of standing out? And maybe also why you're able to capture that market share, obviously. And then secondly, on the ali question, obviously you're targeting automotive, among other sub-industries. Where specifically will the ali go in automotive? Is this going into auto body sheet that historically has been dominated by steel and especially steel supplied by the blast furnaces? Is that where you envision the aluminum to go? Those are my two questions. Thank you very much. Mark Millett : Okay. Well, for the standpoint of our increase in volumes, I would say yes, we are picking up market share. The geographic location of the Sinton, Texas plant is pivotal. Obviously, that was an underserved market. We have access into Mexico now much, much, much cheaper than any other U.S. mill to the tune of, well, we can get it down there for $40 -- $30. Yes, $30 sorry whereas if you're bringing it down from Northern Indiana, it's probably $100 plus. So there's massive geographic sort of advantage for that mill. And we're picking up, as I said, Mexican market. We're picking up energy again because of that location, OCTG and line pipe. So that is one sort of driver, the second driver, I think and I got to applaud the automotive team. They've done a phenomenal job over the last two or three years. The traction there is amazing, particularly with the European auto producers and we're favored because of our carbon footprint and our sustainability sort of profile. Our mills will be, they report, not us, but they report that our Columbus facility for instance, and our Butler facility are probably some of the lowest facilities or carbon producing facilities in the world. We're gaining a lot of market share from that. I think that those are probably the principal gains there. And then on the aluminum, firstly, there is a substantial supply deficit. That industry in can sheet and aluminum is reliant on a very, very large portion of imports today. So we would intend or believe that our low cost position, our efficiency and our commercial approach will be very, very well received and will offset A, some of those imports and B, pick up the share of growth in that industry. You mentioned kind of the steel aspect. Having aluminum in our portfolio gives us the advantage, I guess, if there is a steel decline in any one area with a pickup in aluminum, we can we can penetrate that or take advantage of that. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That is clear. Thank you very much. Mark Millett : Sorry, sorry, sorry, where is it going? Again, the facility is not -- in this case, unlike our start in and steel, we're not revolutionizing the technology necessarily. It's absolute state-of-the-art technology for sure. But it will have the same capability of any high class new aluminum facility in the world. So both unexposed and exposed. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from Tumazos Independent Research. Your line is live. John Tumazos : Thank you. Mark Millett : Good morning, John. John Tumazos : Congratulations on all the progress. I'm looking at your almost $1 billion of cash flow for uses in the quarter, it's just so large and formidable without Sinton at a positive EBITDA and sheet prices were a little low. The numbers are just so big. My first question is, what will you do with all the money? Would you perhaps invest more in scrap? Ferrous scrap, non-ferrous iron ore, lots of opportunities and raw materials or resources. And second, you had a $418 million deduction from cash flow for accrued expenses. I was just curious, what was such a big accrual? Theresa Wagler : John, I'll take the last one. That's a simple one. We have a companywide profit sharing plan. That's how we provide for retirement for all of our 12,000 people. And it's simply 8% of pretax earnings. And since we had a record 2022, we were able to give all the employees $422 million in total. And that payment went out in March. So that's the reason for the significant change. John Tumazos : So it should really be almost amortized uniformly over the quarters from the standpoint of forecasting cash flow? Theresa Wagler : Yes. Well, I mean, you could do it that way, but in actuality, it comes out in March. But, yes, you could look at it that way. John Tumazos : The first quarter had that big deduction from it, and it was still a lot of money? Theresa Wagler : That's correct. Mark Millett : And actually, John, if you're within about 100 miles of any of our facilities on March the 15th, you would have heard the shout and screaming and the crying as to the amazing thing that is and it's massive, massive, massive boost to our employees. And as I tell each and every one of them, it is not a gift. Each and every one of them has earned that profit sharing check. So sorry that's profit sharing. Relative to investing our wealth, so to speak, scrap iron sort of backwardly integrating is not a primary target, certainly iron is certainly not a target at this moment in time. We will and we are looking at options for during a strategic supply of our own pig iron, a green supply, so that's ongoing but not a massive capital expenditure once we move forward with that. On the scrap side, we are spending money on segregation, different ways of cleaning up all the different scrap flows to maximize, a recycled content in the aluminum business and also to reduce the residual level of the obsolete flow again to supplant some of the prime scrap. And that's working out incredibly well, particularly when there's a good spread between obsolete and prime. Not only are you securing a flow of prime scrap, but the cost impact is very, very, very significant reduction in cost or savings. But again we are -- smaller, smaller investments in segregation there, you see us spend a few dollars expanding our scrap footprint in the Southwest, but we're not talking about anything that's going to impact the balance sheet. In all honesty, we expect that that cash flow to continue. And we will continue, I think just the same cash allocation strategy that we've had in the past with a strong balance sheet, huge liquidity, it allows us to have a balanced perspective. We'll continue to have a positive dividend profile. You saw us increase, was it 25% here earlier this year. We'll continue to repurchase our shares. We think it's still at an incredible value today, sure. We're continuing with the organic growth. We got the four coating lines going in, start up later this year. We got the aluminum project and the team for 30 years have continually found good, cost effective, high returning organic growth projects. And there's a bunch in the pipeline there. And obviously, we continue to review the sort of M&A activity as it comes across our desk. So we're very, very blessed for sure. John Tumazos : Thank you. And congratulations. Mark Millett : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Super, thank you. Well, again for those that are still on the call, I just want to appreciate your time today. Appreciate your support for our customers. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We can't do it without you. And to our sure, our team, each and every one of you, you do an absolutely phenomenal job each and every day. And just do one thing for us and me personally, be safe, look after each other. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David and good morning everybody. Thank you for being with us on our second quarter earnings call. Once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Highlights included continued safety improvement, 81% of our facilities were incident free through the quarter, our cash from operations of $808 million and EBITDA generation of $1.2 billion. We also received improved investment-grade credit ratings, providing further third-party confirmation of the strength of our business model. We are also making significant progress on our aluminum flat-rolled investments. There is great excitement within the prospective customer base for new and innovative supply chain solutions from a differentiated supplier. I am incredibly proud of our teams. They are the foundation of our company and they drive our success. Is their culture of excellence, combined with our meaningful value-added growth, diversification and supply chain positioning that is resulting in our earnings strength in all market cycles? However, as I have often said, great financial performance is of no importance without safety for our SDI family. We are focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We are actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation. Our focus, as I said, the team\u2019s safety performance further improved in the second quarter, way ahead of industry averages. There is more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. But before I continue, Theresa, would you like to give us some financial color. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. I add my sincere appreciation and congratulations to the entire team for another strong performance. Our second quarter 2023 net income was $812 million or $4.81 per diluted share with, as Mark mentioned, EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Second quarter 2023 revenues of $5.1 billion were higher than sequential first quarter results, driven by increased realized steel selling values. Our second quarter operating income of $1.1 billion was 27% higher than first quarter results as a result of significantly expanded steel metal spread. As we discuss our business this morning, we are positive with industry fundamentals for the remainder of 2023 and beyond and we are focused toward our continued transformational growth. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $706 million in the second quarter due to metal spread expansion and near-record shipments of 3.2 million tons. High realized pricing more than offset moderately higher scrap costs in the quarter. We realized increased pricing and metal spread across both our flat-rolled and our long product steel operations. As a reminder, we are the primary domestic steel supplier into the railroad rail market as well as a producer of all other long steel products, including structural steel, special bar quality, merchant shapes, specialty shapes and reinforcing bar with over 4.5 million tons of annual capacity. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $40 million, consistent with sequential first quarter results due to increased shipments being offset by lower metal spreads. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing model benefiting us by providing high-quality, lower cost scrap, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our Mexico recycling operations also provide a competitive advantage for reliable supply as well as for future increased scrap aluminum collection. We are the largest North American metals recycler today processing and using ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $462 million in the second quarter lower than first quarter results, but historically strong as average pricing decreased 13% and volumes were steady. Our steel joist and deck order backlog extends into the first quarter of 2024. It has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. However, forward backlog pricing remains very strong and price \u2013 spot pricing remains very resilient. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain strong, but slightly lower than the first half of 2023 levels for the second half of the year. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Labor, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support not only fixed asset investment in steel consumption, but also steel joist index demand in the coming years. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. At June 30, our liquidity was $3.5 billion, inclusive of our recently renewed unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. I\u2019d like to congratulate the team. They actually refinanced revolver yesterday. So thank you to Rick and Dominic. During the second quarter of 2023, we generated cash flow from operations of $808 million and $1.5 billion for the first half of the year. During the first half, we invested $585 million in fixed asset investments. We believe capital investments for the second half of the year will be in the range of $1 billion, the vast majority relating to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and the completion of our four flat-rolled steel coating lines by the end of 2023. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% and repurchased $734 million or 3.9% of our outstanding shares in 2023. At June 30, $606 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion program that we put in place during November of 2022. Since 2017, we have increased our cash dividend 174% and repurchased $4.8 million of our common stock, representing 39% of our outstanding shares. And recognition of our growth, strong balance sheet profile and consistent free cash flow generation capability, last month, we received upgrades, as Mark mentioned, to our investment grade credit designation from both Moody\u2019s and from S&P. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a positive base dividend that\u2019s complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to our investment-grade credit designation. We have placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that supports meaningful strategic growth strong shareholder returns and investment grade metrics. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally increased over the last 5 years from an annual average of $580 million to $2.6 billion currently. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this strategy. We will readily fund our flat-rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we have clearly demonstrated. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy and we are dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We are committed to operating our businesses with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than they may lay ahead for many of our industry and other peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we are moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference playing a leadership role. For those of you on the call, I\u2019d like to track the product differentiation among our flat-rolled shipments. For the second quarter, our hot-rolled shipments were 972,000 tons, our cold-rolled shipments were 149,000 tons, and our coated shipments were 1,150,000 tons. With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, Theresa. And hopefully, folks can hear us, I know it\u2019s \u2013 I guess is not quite up to snuff today, so I apologize for that. But nonetheless, our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. The team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job there, one second. Everyone apologies, but it appears that many folks can\u2019t hear us, hear the call. I would ask you to hang up and call back in and we will just pause the call for a second. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, apologies. Please remain connected. David, we will dial out to you and reconnect on your line. Ladies and gentlemen, participants please remain connected. We will reconnect the speaker line. David, we will dial out to you momentarily. Thank you for holding, ladies and gentlemen. We do apologize. Please remain on the line. The Steel Dynamics conference call will resume shortly. And the speaker line is now reconnected. David Lipschitz : Sorry about that, folks. We will just continue from where you were. Mark Millett : Well, good morning again. Apparently, I believe you heard everything that\u2019s been said, but it\u2019s very, very choppy. So obviously, we will clarify things in the Q&A that perhaps you didn\u2019t hear. I was just kicking off our steel fabrication platform turned in another strong quarter. That team continues to do an absolutely phenomenal job. So thank you to each and every one of them. We continue to have high expectations for that business and we believe non-residential construction markets will continue to be strong in the coming years. Non-residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong through the rest of this year and into \u201824 and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to last year at this time. Continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending and extend the whole non-residential construction cycle. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our perspective. Our steel fabrication order backlog has shortened from its all-time high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains very strong from a historical perspective, extending into January of 2024 with a strong pricing profile. Current order entry pricing remains resilient, and we expect second half \u201823 volumes to be comparable to the first half 2023 shipments. We also believe average pricing will remain elevated, but possibly drift 10% to 15% lower than average for the first half of the year. Not only a significant contributor itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through-cycle utilization rates compared to our peers. It also provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform achieved a strong second quarter despite price declines. After rising in the first quarter, scrap prices pulled back May through July with shredded scrap prices falling almost $100 a ton. We expect scrap pricing to fluctuate modestly during the second half of the year, perhaps seasonally rising somewhat in the third quarter and moderating again in the fourth. Our metals recycling geographic footprint provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican volumes competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat-rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap segregation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will preclude prime first scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide margin enhancement from the aluminum scrap streams and materially increased recycled content of our aluminum sheet products. Our steel operations achieved near record shipments of 3.2 million tons and solid financial results in the second quarter. Our steel production utilization rate, excluding Sinton, was 93% compared to a domestic industry rate of 76%. Our higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles and is manifested by our value-added diversified product offerings, which amount to about 70% of our sales today, competitive advantage supply chain solutions, which is driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility, and the support of internal pull-through manufacturing volume. Our higher through-cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through-cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, backlogs are strong and the customer order entry is good. Auto production is good with expectations of higher output in 2023 relative to 2022 rates and dealer inventories have improved, but still remain below historical norms. Non-residential construction remains strong. Our long product steel backlogs are solid. Onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support in the coming years. The turndown in residential construction seems to be abating. Oil and gas activity is strong, driving improved orders for OCTG and solar continues to grow substantially. At Sinton, the team achieved positive EBITDA for the second quarter and produced shy of 390,000 tons, which is about 52% of full capacity, which is obviously lower than we had planned. But that said, the team has done a phenomenal job to get to that EBITDA positive position. Some of that lack of utilization was being on a single electrical furnace for a portion of the quarter. As we announced on July 1, we experienced equipment issues with the cast this year. Repairs are well underway, and we should be restarting within the next few days. Once we started, we fully expect to progressively ramp up month-over-month to an 80% run rate by the end of the year. The team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the mill. We have four product dimensional capability. That has been proven all the way out to 84-inch down to the 057 and up to 1-inch think. Customers are reporting surface quality to be exceptional. Our strip mill design has allowed for the thermal mechanical rolling, allowing the production of higher strength grades with lower alloy content and thus lower costs. Grade 80, grade 100 have been achieved, and we\u2019ve been approved on and shipped some API grades. And it affirms our technical process choices, and there is no doubt that this is the next-generation electric arc furnace flat-rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance and can sell everything we make and then sell. Our exceptional through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies relative to our expansion into aluminum, responses from both current and new customers across all market sectors remains incredible. We are developing the mill site to co-locate processing and consuming operations as we have successfully done in Sinton, and we have a number of customers already speaking with us about such opportunities, which would be a competitive and sustainably competitive model for all of us. To recap the project. It\u2019s a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat roll facility, which will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, right across the highway essentially from our steel mill there. State-of-the-art facility serving the sustainable beverage and packaging markets, both including body and the automotive arena and industrial sectors. Specifically, we\u2019re targeting 300,000 tons of can, 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 tons of industrial product. The on-site melt slab capacity of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers. We are purchasing and we should be closing on land, both in San Luis Policy-central Mexico and also in the Southwest U.S. in the next 2 or 3 weeks. The mill includes two cash lines for automotive, coating line, downstream processing and packaging lines. We expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. All the principal equipment has been ordered, we anticipate rolling mill start up around mid \u201825. The Mexico slabs center should be January 1, the \u201825 and the Southwest U.S. slab center sometime in the first quarter of the \u201825. Total project cost, including the recycled slab centers should be $2.5 billion. 100% of that is going to be funded with cash. We expect to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA to the company through that investment, plus around $40 million to $50 million of additional earnings from the Omni recycling platform. And from an investment premise perspective, we just see a market environment not unlike that in the steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. Old assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficiency and high-cost operations. significant aluminum flat rolled supply deficit is existing today in North America and is expected to grow in the coming years. And we see a real business alignment whereby we can leverage our core competencies of construction strength on operational know-how and our culture to truly leverage and exploit the technology. We also will be able to leverage Omni\u2019s recyclement footprint and maximize recycled content of the product. We believe it\u2019s a very, very cost-effective, high return growth for us. And again, the existing and new customer interest and support is quite unbelievable. In closing, we are excited. We\u2019re impassioned by the future growth opportunities as they will continue the high returning growth momentum we\u2019ve consistently demonstrated over the years. And we\u2019re celebrating our 30th year in business this August, and there are only better things to come. Our teams are our foundation, and I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication and their commitment. And we are committed to them. I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. There is nothing more important. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. As I said, I think, on the last call, we\u2019re no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry, which in turn, mitigates volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We\u2019re competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, we would love to hand the call over to you and start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Curt Woodworth at Credit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Mark and Theresa. Mark Millett : Good morning. Curt Woodworth : Mark, you talked about fab pricing. You said to be roughly 10% to 15% lower in the back half of the year versus the first half, which seems to put realized pricing around the $4,100 per ton level. Can you help us understand maybe the cadence of how that would shake out between 3Q and 4Q? And then you noted the backlog for fabrication is extending into 2024. Are you seeing any evidence of price stabilization at this point in terms of how the backlog is shaping up in the early part of next year. Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Curt. This is Theresa. So I appreciate the question. When Mark said that the average pricing was expected to be down 10% to 15%, that was just for clarity for everyone on the call, that was measuring the first half of 2023 to the second half of 2023. So it wasn\u2019t specific to a point in time or specific to the second quarter itself. And we would say that we expect the cadence to be pretty equal from that step down in the third quarter and then stepping down a bit finally into the fourth quarter. Pricing is stable. It\u2019s been very \u2013 I think the term we keep using is resilient, and that\u2019s something that we pointed to in the past. We think there is been a structural shift in pricing for steel fabrication as there is really a lack of substitutability when you think about steel joist and deck and there is a very good demand today and we think increasing demand with the momentum behind manufacturing for all the different reasons that we pointed to this morning. The backlog has a good pricing, very strong pricing from a historical perspective. And I think that we see that heading very favorably into the first quarter. And frankly, we were just talking about it this morning, as you think about a lot of the public monies in those programs, those are being awarded, especially with the IRA and some of the Department of Labor dollars. Those are getting awarded sometime this fall kind of call it late third quarter, early fourth quarter. So that should really benefit 2024 and 2025 as you think about manufacturing and construction. And definitely, steel fabrication will benefit from that. Curt Woodworth : Okay. And then in terms of the volume guidance, it seems like volumetrically you\u2019re still expecting year-on-year decline in kind of the 15% to 20% level and you noted some project delays. Can you just kind of comment on within the backlog, or I guess, projects that have been burning off? Are there certain pockets of weakness you\u2019re seeing that are greater than others. Obviously, there is been kind of a lot of talk on some of the warehouse spending dying down, but data centers and other areas seem to be really strong. So any color you can give on that would be helpful. And then just as a follow-up, can you give a comment on what you think capital spending for 2024 would be. Thank you very much. Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Curt. Yes. So as it relates to the mix of the backlog and I would say more so even in the current order intake activity. We have seen \u2013 and I think it\u2019s positive for the economy in general. We\u2019ve seen a more projects coming in from, whether it be education, healthcare, definitely manufacturing. So we\u2019re starting to even see the electric vehicle batteries. We\u2019ve seen the chips we\u2019ve seen a lot of advent and manufacturing from onshoring new things that we\u2019ve talked about. So there is a mix towards those type of projects and away from just purely retail warehouses, which we\u2019ve been seeing and talking about for a while now, probably 6 to 9 months. As it relates to capital spending for 2024, we expect to have capital spending for the aluminum project this year is likely to be somewhere between $900 million and $950 million in total. Next year for the aluminum project is likely to be about $1.2 billion. So when you combine that with additional growth projects as well as a minimal amount of maintenance capital. We\u2019re likely to have total capital spending in 2024 from what we can see today, still around that $1.5 billion for the year. Curt Woodworth : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Cleveland Rueckert at UBS Securities. Cleveland Rueckert : Great. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one sort of on the aluminum side. I guess just looking at your budget and sort of outlook for demand there. Recently, there is been a downturn in aluminum can demand and that industry has been, I guess, a little bit disrupted. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s at all concerning to you and if you\u2019ve adapted your demand forecast at all. Mark Millett : Absolutely not. We remain very, very bullish now. If you go back like a year now, perhaps the folks were projecting that demand would grow and you need four new aluminum mills. We didn\u2019t believe that then. We don\u2019t believe that now. But we certainly feel there is more space than to satisfy our market share for sure. The kind of the \u2013 sort of the pull back, I would say, is more an inventory standpoint. There is a lot of inventory people panicked a lot last year. That inventory has to flow through the system. And there is absolutely no doubt that it is doing so today. And in all honesty, when our mill comes up, I think that the marketplace is going to be in a beautiful place for us to receive product. Are you going to look longer-term, there definitely is a social change away from POC plastic bottles that will continue. It\u2019s not just beer, it\u2019s water, it\u2019s all fluids. And then when you look at the automotive arena, we believe and we\u2019ve \u2013 with our communications with virtually all the automotive folks, they have been restrained from developing greater volumes of aluminum through the lack of availability. We\u2019re providing that availability going forward. And I think we \u2013 just as we\u2019ve done in steel, we will gain market share quite rapidly. So from a market perspective, we are still very bullish that the amount of interest we have across the aluminum space is incredible. And I think I said it on our last call, in steel, we\u2019ve never entered a market that is underserved. Every market we\u2019ve gone into, we\u2019ve had to differentiate ourselves to gain market share. It\u2019s refreshing for us that people are actually coming to us and when you combine that need with our ability to change the supply chain to provide much greater value to the customer base, I think we\u2019re confident to gain that market share quite rapidly. Theresa Wagler : Cleve, just as a quick reminder. In the last several years, they have had domestically the consumers of aluminum sheet actually had to import about 20% of their needs, and that had high tariffs associated with that imported costs. So there is definitely room for just 630,000 tons of additional supply. Cleveland Rueckert : Good. Got it. I appreciate the confidence. And if I may just sneak in one follow-up question on Sinton. I think you had to replace a bearing on the caster. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve got \u2013 I didn\u2019t hear it in the prepared remarks that maintenance work has been done and back on schedule. Barry Schneider : Yes, this is Barry. I\u2019d just like to comment that those bearing issues we talked about at the tail end of last year, our teams mitigated most of the effects of that. We have a supply chain now that is both a more robust design and a more robust supply chain. So we\u2019re really excited about the quality improvements and really the reliability of those casting segment parts. We believe our long-term plans, we kind of approached it with several different prongs. And all of them are really being successful and it\u2019s to the point now that we can manage it very well and we\u2019re operating at full capacity, as Marc spoke, all capabilities of the machine right now are in place. So we believe long-term, that\u2019s going to be not an issue going forward that it will just continue to be high reliability and continuing high quality. Cleveland Rueckert : Thanks, Barry. But didn\u2019t \u2013 wasn\u2019t there an unplanned outage very recently? Barry Schneider : Yes, that \u2013 we had a caster sheer issue just here at the beginning of July, not related to the bearing issue, perhaps as you mentioned with the casting machine. And it\u2019s kind of a technical issue with the caster sheer. And suffice to say it\u2019s large parts that we wanted to make sure we had put in properly and we are taking this opportunity to address a couple of other issues, but we anticipate that facility being up and operational in the next few days. Our team has done a phenomenal job for working together and getting the scope of a project. We\u2019re super excited. Mark and I were down there for moral support, definitely not getting in the way of the guys making the repairs. But great to see this team just really owning their technology and bringing it forward. So we anticipate this problem to be behind us. And we think we\u2019ve put in really good things to mitigate any future failures that are similar to this. Cleveland Rueckert : Okay, got it. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with Exane BNP Paribas. Tristan Gresser : Yes. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is maybe on the steel side. Can you tell us a little bit about the volume outlook into Q3 I noticed loan volumes were down on a year-on-year basis in Q2. So should we expect some pickup there? And with the symptom outage, how should we think, generally speaking, for steel shipments into Q3? That\u2019s my first question. Thank you. Theresa Wagler : Tristan, this is Theresa. Thanks for the question. So we \u2013 generally, we don\u2019t give guidance as it relates to specifics on shipments. And if you look historically, the third quarter is going to be generally the strongest shipment quarter. that we have in shipments for steel simply because of seasonality. Sinton is going to be down for July. We are still running the coal mill and the value add lines, which will help to place some of the lost volume. But we\u2019re likely to have lost volume of anywhere between 50,000 and 70,000 tons of total steel shipments as it relates to the sheer outage in July. Other than that, we really can\u2019t give you any additional guidance, but as Mark mentioned, the backlogs across the steel platform are very strong and order activity has been very good. Tristan Gresser : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up just on the fabrication business. You mentioned that joist and deck spot prices have stopped falling, at which level exactly you are seeing them now. Theresa Wagler : Tristan, we can\u2019t give specific pricing related to the commercial teams would be after me. So, I think what we have said about pricing for fabrication is that the pricing has been very resilient. We have strong pricing in the backlog, but we did mention that there are expectations that pricing on average from \u2013 compared to the first half of the year, pricing on average for the second half of the year is likely to be down 10% to 15%, but we do believe pricing is stable, and it\u2019s been very resilient. Tristan Gresser : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba at Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Thank you very much. Good morning. So, just on pricing as well. Maybe you can provide some color even without giving those details. What we have seen in the benchmark information is how deep galvanized prices have been recently below the substrate cold-rolled coil prices, which is a little bit weird and obviously not sustainable. But can you provide some color as to whether you are also seeing that in your realized prices for these products? And one might explain the initial situation? Mark Millett : Yes. Carlos, thanks for the question. The marketplace is a little frothy right now. I would say the recent \u2013 the most recent change here in the CRU downward here yesterday or the day before in our mind doesn\u2019t represent the market dynamics that\u2019s going on at the time. Carlos De Alba : Alright. Okay. Thanks Mark. And then just on Sinton, I wanted to confirm that you still expect the cost of the recent outage to be around $1 million, which is pretty insignificant. And when would you expect to reach closer to 100% capacity utilization, if that is your intent or do you believe or you want to stay around 80% that you will reach towards the end of the year? Mark Millett : Well, the \u2013 actually, the outage \u2013 the actual specific cost it was well under $1 million. It \u2013 as Barry said, the issue was just getting parts and just the size of the equipment involved, it wasn\u2019t necessarily a large expense to repair. And the second part of that, sorry. Well, again, as you saw or as you heard from our comments, we are just tempering our expectations. We have always had higher expectations. And we just believe once we get up and running here in the next few days, we were at \u2013 when we shutdown 52%, 55% or thereabouts, we are just suggesting now that month-over-month we are going to progressively ramp up to that 80% by the end of the year. And then into next year, we will continue to incrementally ramp up to full production through \u201824. Carlos De Alba : Got it. So, in the second half of next year, fourth quarter next year is when you expect to get full capacity then? Theresa Wagler : No, Carlos. I would say that Mark \u2013 what Mark said is that we are going to have kind of an even pace we expect of ramp-up in the second half of this year for 2023 to get up to that 80%. But then we will reach the 100% of capacity very quickly in 2024. Carlos De Alba : Alright. Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Theresa Wagler : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Yes. Hey, good morning. Mark Millett : Good morning Timna. Timna Tanners : Wanted to just ask a little bit more about the cadence of added supply that you have outlined on the new coating and painting lines. Like should we start modeling contribution immediately in the third quarter? Will that be more fourth quarter and first quarter weighted? And then I have a second question. Thanks. Barry Schneider : Timna, this is Barry. We are anticipating bringing the new coding and the galvanizing lines, paint lines on at the end of the year. But I wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of a significant contribution to shipment still going into 2024. But the lines are constructing very well. There continues to be supply chain issues with certain parts of the construction, but we are resolving those and mitigating them and moving stuff, teams are very active in manned up. So, we look forward to bringing these lines on, but it will be near the end of the year. Timna Tanners : Okay. Helpful. Appreciate that. And then my only other question was just an update on your export activity and just how that\u2019s trending. I know you have been pretty active shipping to Mexico, just wondering if there is anything new there. Mark Millett : From \u2013 other than a small little bit of non-ferrous, we have no export activity other than Mexico. Barry Schneider : Yes. Timna, this is Barry again. We have been doing quite a bit of shipments into Mexico this year. Sin is uniquely \u2013 the capabilities of Sin are sitting are unique for what the Mexican markets are. So, being able to get some heavier gauge products and wider products down there has been a very good place for us to develop relationships. So, we have been down in shipping to Mexico for a long time, but significantly so in the first half of this year and we continue to do more of that, especially through our campus partners at the Sinton facility. So, we see that as a really good business and continuing to grow forward. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thanks again. Mark Millett : We certainly capitalized a little on the AMSA situation down there. And even as they restart, and obviously, there is a lot of projections as to how quickly they restart, if they restart. But we are quite confident that the customer base there around AMSA certainly in Monclova has recognized that single sourcing is a huge mistake. And even with an arms of startup, we are going to continue to secure a lot of that business that we have and market share that we have gained. Timna Tanners : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bill Peterson at JPMorgan. Bill Peterson : Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask you about the decarbonization strategy. You put some information on the about carbon initiatives. I mean you discussed the operations by early 2024, but just to confirm, I guess is the plant construction begun, or are there any other areas to prove out or technical readiness issues to address? That\u2019s the first question. Theresa Wagler : Thanks Bill. So, the biocarbon facility is actually going really well. The teams have done a lot of groundwork already. The major equipment is either has been ordered or is on order and some of it is actually going to be received fairly shortly. So, the team is doing a phenomenal job. I am very proud of them in Mississippi and the expectations are that it will start before the end of 2024. There is nothing left to prove as far as the product itself. There is a facility in Marquette, Michigan that Aymium operates, which is the technology provider. And we have tested the product extensively, both for injection and charge carbon. So, we don\u2019t have any expectations for anything other than a wonderful product that we can replace eventually 100% or a very large portion thereof of our anthracite usage going forward. So, everything is going really, really well. Bill Peterson : Yes, appreciate that. And I forgot to ask what do you expect in terms of the cost on that, but compared to traditional? But I guess my second question is, as we think about this additional galvanized capacity, you have mentioned this kind of end of the year and then more contribution for next year. But I guess how is your view given that there is also another \u2013 a lot of other plant capacity coming to market? What\u2019s the risk you might see in terms of lower prices longer term with the additional capacity from competitors in the space in and so would that kind of \u2013 and for me to wrap up? Theresa Wagler : Let me address the cost of the bio facility and then Barry and Mark can take the galvanizing pricing question. We believe that we are still kind of fine point on it, but it\u2019s likely to cost somewhere between $200 million and $230 million for the entire project. But remember, it is a joint venture that we have with Aymium. And so we have 75% ownership of the facility and Aymium has 25% of the facility. Bill Peterson : Okay. Thanks. Mark Millett : And relative to the concern of overcapacity in almost over the years now, perhaps I have been in the industry too long. But everyone is \u2013 it wasn\u2019t so long ago that there was going to be overcapacity in the iron ore business and it\u2019s going to go down to $35 a ton. And then it was the sheet issue where I think everyone is recognizing now that with the continued shutdown of the old inefficient high-cost assets in the integrated business in the country. The desire for low-carbon products that we are not going to see a material impact to any increase in the sheet market. And I think the same with coated people are gravitating to produce their parts with more coated. I can remember cause a not so long ago, the outside skin was just galvanized and now you look at a car today and almost every single piece is galvanized. So, demand is increasing for sure. The world is getting lighter gauge galvanized so the line time of \u2013 goes up and thus the actual sort of effective throughput of the line is \u2013 lines are going down today. So, we are not overly concerned. Bill Peterson : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Tumazos at Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you. In planning Sinton, you have 1.8 million tons of customers on your campus. The buy end to the distributor based in Houston, for coating lines as well as the customer opportunities in Mexico, you were describing more than the 3 million-ton capacity. As you are ramping up, how are you allocating the volume among those customers? It appears as though there is more customers and China output. What specifications have you been not yet gotten to melting and casting and rolling in terms of chemistries, gauges, widths, etcetera? Barry Schneider : John, this is Barry. As far as product dimensions, we have explored everything that we believe we needed to do. So, we are doing light gauge to heavy stuff, full with the products. We have done many different of the metallurgical needs from vacuum degas products all the way up through the range of different steels we would make. We are minded to do automotive there, but those types of trials require us to really get an idea of what our line capabilities are. So, we are doing those. We are doing the same with the API type products. And that requires us to have confidence in the data so that we design the best products to go into trials. We do have customers in both areas taking material. So, we are doing it in a very controlled manner to make sure that again, we are understanding the unique capabilities that Sinton has. So, at this point, the broad swath of products, we have done something for almost every single thing we hope to sell. And it\u2019s more about getting more data, getting more characteristics from how we produce those things. And at the same time, establishing those internal, how we process things is very important. Just this week, the ISO certification audits are going on. So, it\u2019s very important that we do this as our customers expect. But right now, good progress. We are excited by it and we will look to optimize each of our units. So, we have always had a very diverse order book so that we have many small markets that we can participate in. So, we are focused on making sure that we are feeding all of the different buckets, keeping all of our lines operational as we ramp up and bring these new coating lines online. So, it\u2019s a very controlled structure, and we are trying to be very respected to the customer base that\u2019s very anxious to receive these products. Mark Millett : Yes, John, I guess we remain \u2013 this is what is happening. Hopefully, you can hear us still. But we remain incredibly excited by what we have seen in Sinton. As I have said earlier, we can sell everything we can make and a whole bunch more. We are really excited about the additional galv line and pre-paint line down there that will allow us to, as we have done at Columbus and at Butler diversify the product mix and bring even more value add to it. The energy products, the ability to thermal mechanical roll produce those higher strength grades, the high tough grades at lower cost is working incredibly well. And that\u2019s going to be a great market for us down there. And those products are value-add. It may be hot band, but you accrue a good premium for those products. And we are also seeing in the plate arena, great potential then. One of the on-site processes that you mentioned that we co-locate is a real heavy plate cutter length line. And we feel there is going to be massive opportunity there, particularly as the infrastructure growth occurs and plate is going to be a big component in that. So Sinton, it\u2019s incredible. One needs to go there to really experience it. The equipment reliability issues are frustrating, but it\u2019s absolutely a state-of-the-art mill. The team is excited. They will get that thing running for blast in time. And it will be the technology of choice going forward. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you. And for those still on the call, our employees, in particular, thank you for what you do each and every day. You do drive a success. We can\u2019t do things without you. Our customers, thank you for your loyal support. And our shareholders, thank you those that are invested in us. We will continue to treat your dollars just like they are our own. We are going to continue to grow them. And we have a huge bright future ahead of us, Sinton kicking in the aluminum going forward, the growth momentum continues. So, thank you. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

After the management remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. Please be advised this call is being recorded today, October 19, 2023 and your participation implies consent to our recording this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Holly. Good morning and welcome to Steel Dynamics third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today\u2019s call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics and Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today\u2019s statements, which speak only as of this date maybe forward-looking and predictive, specifically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting out new assets in the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel metal recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annual filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results. And now, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us on our third quarter earnings call. As you saw in the release, once again, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational quarter. Almost 80% of our facilities had zero safety incidents, and our company-wide trailing 12-month incident rate is running at an all-time low. So congratulations to everyone, but more importantly, thank you for all your work to make that happen. It takes each and every one of us to get there. Cash from operations was a healthy $1.1 billion, and with the adjusted EBITDA generation of $876 million. I think this performance truly affirms the cash generation resiliency of our diversified value added product portfolio. Seeing significant momentum in our aluminum flat rolled investments, both current and prospective customers are excited by our market entry and the new and differentiated supply chain solutions we can provide. They're actually very, very surprised by the speed and completeness of our execution so far. Sinton mill has proven its nameplate production capacity rate, and full product capability, but does remain challenged by equipment reliability issues. We're confident we can resolve the majority of these issues by the year-end. Successes cannot be achieved without the best metals team in the industry. I am incredibly proud to the whole SDI family. Their passion and spirit form the foundation of our company. They drive our success and it's an honor to work among them. In fact, in this world of turmoil with the human catastrophe happening in the Ukraine, the atrocities in Israel, the suppression of the Palestinian people and even closer to home, the anger and divisiveness within America and our political structure really is inspiring to come to work each and every day and be surrounded by very, very positive people that think right, they get it, they treat people right and a focus on what we do each and every day. As such, our greatest leadership commitment is to our SDI family. Not only our colleagues that come to work, but also their partners in life and their kids. They remind our team\u2019s great financial performance of no importance without keeping everyone safe. We continue to be focused on providing the very best for the health, safety, and welfare. Today, the SDI family, when you include everyone, we have over 45,000 people that are reliant on the decisions that we make each and every day and we're focused. We truly are focused on that. Together, we're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation. Before I continue, Theresa would you like to give us some details? Theresa Wagler : Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Mark. Add my sincere appreciation to our teams for a really solid performance in the third quarter. Our third quarter 2023 net income was $577 million or $3.47 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $876 million. Third quarter 2023 revenues of $4.6 billion and operating income of $734 million were lower than sequential second quarter results driven by lower realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. We see solid industry fundamentals for the rest of this year and beyond, and we're focused on our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our steel operations generated operating income of $474 million in the third quarter lower than sequential second quarter results due to flat rolled steel pricing metal spray compression as realized pricing declined more than average scrap costs. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons, excluding the lost volume of approximately 90,000 tons related to Sinton's unplanned July outage. We expect our four new flat rolled coating lines to begin operating in the first quarter of 2024 at both Sinton and Heartland increasing our value added mix by additional 1 million tons making so that our total coating capacity will be 6.9 million tons going forward. For those that track our detailed flat rolled shipments, in the third quarter, we had hot rolled and P&O shipments of 858,000 tons; cold rolled shipments of 132,000 tons; and coated shipments of 1,202,000 tons. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $19 million, significantly lower than second quarter results due to non-ferrous and ferrous metal spray compression. Ferrous scrap demand was also reduced as numerous domestic steel mills had maintenance outages in the quarter. We are the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non-ferrous aluminum, copper, and other metals. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing higher quality lower cost scrap to our still mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital requirements.  Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $330 million in the third quarter lower than sequential second quarter results, yet historically strong as average realized pricing declined 11% and volumes declined 16,000 tons. Our steel joist and deck demand remains solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first quarter of 2024. The backlog has contracted from record highs experienced in 2022 as shipments have outpaced spot order activity. Forward backlog pricing remains very strong and spot pricing resilient. Based on our backlog, customer sentiment and manufacturing momentum, we expect steel fabrication earnings to remain solid in the fourth quarter, but below third quarter levels based on seasonally lower volumes. Infrastructure, Inflation Reduction Act, Department of Energy decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment in related steel and joists and deck consumption in the coming years. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and generated $2.7 billion on a year-to-date basis. At September 30th, we achieved record liquidity of $3.7 billion inclusive of cash, liquid investments and our unsecured $1.2 billion revolver. Year-to-date of 2023 we've invested $1.1 billion in capital investments. For the fourth quarter, we estimate capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, of which around $350 million is related to our aluminum flat rolled investments. Much of the remaining capital is related to the completion of our four new value added coded lines. In February, we increased our cash dividend 25% to $0.425 per common share. Year-to-date 2023 we've also repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock, representing almost 6% of our outstanding shares. At September 30th, $278 million remained authorized for repurchase under our existing $1.5 billion authorized plan. Since 2017, we've increased our dividend per share by 174% and repurchase $5.2 billion of our common stock, representing over 40% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with a variable share repurchase program. We remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation at the same time. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years, generating from an annual average of $540 million to $2.6 billion today. We've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns while maintaining investment grade metrics. Our aluminum growth strategy is consistent with this philosophy. We will readily fund our flat rolled aluminum investments with available cash and cash flow from operations. We also plan to continue strong and responsible shareholder distributions as we've clearly demonstrated, we're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility could decrease our still scope one greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%, and we currently expect to have the facility operating in the second half of 2024. We have an actual path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with its intention to make a positive difference. And again, before I turn the call back over to Mark, I just want to thank the teams for a great performance. Mark? Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Theresa. As you saw, the steel fabrication platform continues to perform well and it turned in another solid quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the future earnings profile of this business. We believe non-residential construction markets will be strong in the coming years. Some residential starts and build rates are forecast to remain strong into 2024, and related spending has been higher in 2023 compared to the last year at this time. So political dysfunction has delayed the awarding of public monies likely into the first quarter of next year, the infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, along with the reshoring and manufacturing should provide momentum for additional construction spending through 2024 effectively extending the construction cycle. And customer commentary has, as I talked to lot of folks out there, has confirmed our positive outlook. Deal of fabrication order backlog has certainly shortened from its historical high of over 12 months achieved in 2022, but it remains strong from a historical perspective, standing through March, 2024 with strong forward pricing. Current order entry pricing remains resilient. Not only a significant contributor unto itself, our fabrication platform provides meaningful pull-through volume for our steel mills, particularly important in softer markets, allowing for higher through cycle steel production utilization rates compared to our peers, adding to the resiliency of our through cycle cash generation. Furthermore, it provides an effective natural hedge to lower steel prices. Our metals recycling platform had a challenging quarter. Its demand from domestic steel mills softened and realized ferrous scrap prices declined. Scrap prices pulled back in the third quarter with bushing prices falling some $80 a ton. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our electric arc furnace steel mills, and our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton and raw material positions. We also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technological solutions, enhancing margin, increasing the availability of low residual ferrous scrap. This will mitigate prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It'll also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities on that platform. Our steel operations achieve strong shipments of 3.1 million tons and solid financial results in the third quarter. Steel production utilization rate when you exclude Sinton was 90% compared to a domestic industry rate of some 76%. The higher utilization rates have been clearly demonstrated throughout all market cycles driven by the value added diversified product offerings, which are amount to 70% of our sales. And this, as Theresa mentioned, will increase further with the addition of two galvanizing and two paint lines that will be commissioned in the first quarter of 2024. Differentiated supply chain solutions driving customer preference and mitigating price volatility and support of downstream internal pull-through manufacturing volume are all contributors. Our higher through cycle utilization rate is a key differentiator and supports our strong and growing through cycle cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Looking forward, steel backlogs are strong and customer order entry is good. Customer inventories are also at historically low levels. Auto production estimates for 2023 remained around 15 million units, but obviously with the ongoing strike, the outlook for the remainder of the year is somewhat opaque. So positively, dealer inventories remain below historical norms, which will be further reduced by the ongoing strike. [Indiscernible] demand there is still strong and with tight supply, the auto build rate will likely be higher than the already anticipated 16 million unit plus for 2024. In the meantime, unfortunately, our auto direct flat rolled exposure is more concentrated toward European and Asian producers, which so far has mitigated the strike impact on our flat rolled auto volume. Although not a significant impact to overall earnings, we are seeing greater impact at our engineered bar division as their 15% -- 20% auto exposure is mostly consumed by domestic auto producers. Non-residential construction remains solid. Our long product steel backlogs are good and customer inventory levels are low. General market is estimated to be off 8% of some due to seasonality, but should rebound as infrastructure spending provides meaningful support in the first half of 2024. The turn down in residential construction seems to be abating with a depletion of available home inventory. Oil and gas activity is strong driving improved orders for OCTG products and still continues to grow at a rapid rate. In total aggregate, long product demand remains solid and in flat rolled lead times are extending. We're seeing excellent order entry. Supply chain inventory is low, and pricing is certainly in an upward trend. We certainly anticipate further meaningful strength once the strike is concluded. Turning to Sinton. After the unplanned July outage related to the caster shear, the Sinton team produced over 290,000 tons in the quarter. The mill has clearly demonstrated its production rate capability and achieving 36 heat sequence lengths, and it\u2019s exceeded its hourly nameplate run rate. However, as I said, the constrained production is manifest from a low utilization rate caused principally by equipment reliability issues. That said, we expect to progressively ramp up to about 70% total run rate by the end of 2023, reaching a production of 2.4 million tons for 2024.  Despite our challenges, the team has demonstrated the key competitive advantages of the Texas steel mill. We have completed full product dimensional capability. It's proven up to one inch thick, down to 053, I do believe out to 84-inch width. Customers are reporting exceptional surface quality and the hot strip mill design has allowed for thermal mechanical rolling, allowing production of higher strength grades, tough grades with lower alloy content and thus lowering costs for those value added products. We've achieved grade 80, 100 and already been approved for some API grades. I think just generally, it affirms our technical and process choices, and there's no doubt that in my mind it's the next generation of electric arc furnace flat rolled steel technology of choice. We have gained strong market acceptance and we can sell every pound of steel we make. Our exceptional through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and our growth investment strategies. Relative to our expansion into aluminum, as I said the responses from existing and new customers across all markets is absolutely incredible. We are developing the site. We purchased some 2,600 acres, I do believe, but we're developing it for the colocation of customers with the rolling mill as we successfully did in Sinton. We're seeing a number of customers who are already indicating strong interest in that model because it provides a sustainable, competitive model for all of us. To recap the project, the 650,000 metric ton flat rolled facility, the rolling mill will be located in Columbus, Mississippi, state-of-the-art facility, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging, automotive and industrial sectors. Approximately 300,000 metric tons will be canned, 200,000 tons auto and 150,000 industrial. We have onsite mill and cast slab capacity in Columbus of around 600,000 metric tons and the project will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers one in central Mexico and one in Arizona to capture scrap close to its source. We'll have two cast lines, coating lines, and downstream processing and packaging lines to fully support our customer base. Startup plans are still anticipated for mid-2025 start for the rolling mill. Mexico slab center should start up late 2024, perhaps January 2025, and the Arizona slab center in the first quarter of 2025. So the project cost, including all recycled slab centers, is around $2.5 billion, 100% to be funded with cash. As we stated in the past, we expect a through cycle annual EBITDA of around about $650 million to $700 million from the aluminum portion, and the support of OmniSource will draw another $40 million to $50 million for them. I think the market from an investment premise perspective, what excites me is the market environment is very similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. The industry generally has older assets, had a tough time earning its cost of capital. There's been little reinvestment over the last 45 years. It has heavy legacy costs, tends to be inefficient in high cost operations. Again parallels the situation we saw within the steel industry 30 years ago. According that we see a definite deficiency in supply that is exists in North America. And that deficiencies expected to grow even with our and second competitor's new facility. From our perspective, it is an adjacent industry to us. It leverages our ability to design and build commission ramp up the large capital assets and operate those assets very effectively, efficiently, at low cost through our performance and incentivized innovated and very effective culture. In closing, we're excited and impassioned and we always are, and we continue to be by our future growth opportunities as they will continue to the high returning growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. Culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has rewarded our shareholder by top-notch in class returns. We're no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing an enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In return [ph], mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. Our teams are a foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. As I remind those listening today, that safety for yourselves, your families, and for each other is the highest of priorities, but competitively position and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members, our shareholders alike. Thank you. Thank you for joining us again today. And Holly, we would love to turn it over to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Martin Englert at Seaport Research Partners. Martin Englert : Hello. Good morning, everyone. Mark Millett : Good morning. Martin Englert : Within the Steel segment, steel conversion costs, which do include some substrate costs increase I think to around about 576 per ton in the quarter from 522. Is there any additional color that you can share regarding the portion of substrates, and maybe some positives and negatives when you think about these sequential change in contributions between true conversion costs and substrates, as well as if there was any material impact from the Sinton outage on that conversion cost. Theresa Wagler : Good morning, Martin. It's Theresa. Great question and observation. It really didn't have anything to do with the change in substrate mix, but that can have an impact. But there's two things that I would point to. One is the fact that because Sinton didn't operate all of July, the way that you're calculating your conversion costs, that lack of volume does have a pretty significant impact. It's not that there was additional costs, the costs were pretty de minimis. It's just that lost volume affecting the denominator. It's really affecting your conversion costs on a per ton basis, a little bit on an outsized way. The second thing is that we are preparing to start the value added lines in Heartland and then Sinton will follow thereafter in the coming months. And there's some additional costs related to that as well. But nothing to point to that would be systemic of higher conversion costs going forward. Martin Englert : Okay. So there's certainly a one-off that seemed material for the quarter and then some lingering, kind of transitory as you're working on ramping the other value added assets that will -- how long do you think that will persist for -- through the fourth quarter and then in the first quarter of next year? Any idea? Theresa Wagler : No. So Martin, with the advent of Sinton now operating and not being a part of that outage, you're going to have that incremental volume, which is going to really make that conversion cost get back in line with what you're used to seeing. But the value added line, there is some incremental cost. It's nothing that is necessarily significant that you'll have to try to figure out for the fourth quarter. We have two of the lines coming line maybe even before the end of the year with the remaining two for the first, probably first couple months in the first quarter. Martin Englert : Thank you for that. If I could one last one here, excluding 2020, looking at seasonality in 4Q total steel shipments, they tend to decline around 5% sequentially. Is there anything you're seeing this year that would suggest something different? And I imagine comparing the sequential with the Sinton outage and then Sinton backup probably might have an impact here on a sequential basis. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. So you're spot on, Martin. We would expect to see normal seasonality within the steel operations, but as you have now Sinton ramping up and operating for the full fourth quarter, you will see some benefit from that additional volume. Martin Englert : And you're aiming for 70% utilization on exit for the year with Sinton, correct? Theresa Wagler : That's correct. Martin Englert : Okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations navigating the downward market on and the continued growth investments. Theresa Wagler : Thanks Martin. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carlos de Alba at Morgan Stanley. Carlos de Alba : Yeah. Thank you very much. Good morning. Just continue on Sinton. I wonder if you can give us a little bit of color on the EBITDA generated by the operation, and how you see that going forward. Theresa Wagler : Martin, I'm sorry. You cut out. David Lipschitz : Do you repeat that? Carlos de Alba : Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Just on Sinton, given the outrage and that you experienced, but things now are ramping up nicely and you expect full production, well at least production throughout the fourth quarter. How do you see the evolution of the EBITDA generated by the company, by this -- the plant Sinton? Theresa Wagler : Carlos, we can't give -- we won't give specific guidance on the earnings associated with Sinton. We are giving updated items on volume so that you can understand from a modeling perspective. So we would expect to see a significant improvement from the third quarter given the fact that we weren't operating all of July. But that being said, I really can't give you any guidance specific to what the EBITDA will be at Sinton. Carlos de Alba : All right. And then just maybe one more on the fabrication business. You did mention strong forward pricing in your backlog. Is there any additional color that you can provide given, the extraordinary strong pricing that we have seen in recent quarters relative to history? Theresa Wagler : No, that's okay. It has to do with fabrication the pricing in the backlog. So from a historical basis and even from recent 2023, the pricing in the backlog is very strong. Much higher than previous historical peaks. We've seen that be maintained the spot market, where the order activity isn't as strong as it was in 2022. It's still really good from the -- a historical basis, but that is contracting the backlog somewhat. So now it extends through the first quarter of 2024. And I think something else that we just -- I want to keep in perspective. Mark mentioned it on his opening notes, but I want to reiterate it because I think it's really important. We've been talking about the IRA monies, the Department of Energy monies, monies that are coming from the administration for public dollars. It's our estimate. And others would agree that there's likely not even 5% to 10% of that money that's been allocated or awarded yet. It's going much slower than anyone had expected and much slower than the administrative -- administration had indicated that it would. So those projects aren't benefiting the elongation of construction, steel consumption success, asset investment, steel joist, and deck demand as well. We're fully expecting, and what we're hearing from the administration and from others is that those dollars will start flowing in the first half of 2024. So right now there's a bit of a gap in funding and I think you're seeing that in the volumes, but we fully expect that to pick up and improve in 2024 and 2025. Carlos de Alba : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Tristan Gresser at Exane BNP Paribas. Tristan Gresser : Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, following up on the fabrication. You provided some guidance back in Q2 and I now understand that the stable volume guidance half and half is no longer valued. So I was wondering if -- and it's not the first time the guidance has been cut there, so what is driving quarter after quarter that they can have cut in that weakness? And you provided some color on the sequential movements. I guess on the scale side for Q4 volumes, can you tell us a little bit more about fab. And the same question a little bit on ASP, you guided for down 10% to 15% in H2 versus H1 on the ASP front. The Q3 ASP is already down 17% versus that level. So can you help us try to calibrate the weakness in ASP we should expect in Q4, but also in Q1 because you have some visibility into that quarter as well. Theresa Wagler : From a modeling perspective, just from a volume, I mentioned in my opening notes that we do expect to see some regular seasonality in the steel fabrication volume as well. So sequentially we would expect it to be modestly lower than what you would've seen the third quarter. But again, we're not attesting that to -- I think I addressed the consumption question when I responded to Carlos. As it relates to average pricing. Again, the backlog's very strong. If you're having seasonally lower volumes, I think it's a reasonable expectation to think pricing will be down somewhat, but we don't see it being in the same magnitude as the sequential second to third quarter, it'll be somewhat less than that. Tristan Gresser : Alright. If I may\u2026 Mark Millett : Relative to the pricing, it's -- the market actually has been a little confounding because since mid-July, we have seen the market being very, very strong, very solid. In fact, order input rate has been great. You have a situation where people -- it was more emotional there. There's no main structural change in demand that allowed, or pushed pricing down. It was more emotion relative to the strike. Mid-September when people recognized that it's sort of already been baked into the price, when they saw that inventories are very, very, very low and the supply chain, they see that lead times are stretch -- already stretching out, that we've seen an inflection and that there is definitely an upward momentum in collaborative pricing today. It's our anticipation and the anticipation of others that there's going to be quite a market increase in pricing once there's a resolution to that strike. Looking forward, we see a very positive -- very positive constructive market environment. Tristan Gresser : Thank you. That's very helpful. If I just have a quick follow up and this time more on the capital allocation side. I mean, given the current context, and I think you touch on and you reaffirm what are your capital allocation priorities are, can you just reiterate what you view on inorganic growth? And could you confirm that at the moment you're not interested in looking at large acquisition on the flat rolled side and that's not an area of focus and that right now a 100% of your attention is on aluminum? Theresa Wagler : Tristan, we can't confirm that. So from a growth perspective, we're very transparent on capital allocation. Our primary focus is for high return growth, and that can be both organically and it can be transactional. We are very much focused on the aluminum strategy and that will be a priority. We are sitting with record liquidity at the end of the quarter of $3.7 billion. So we really have, I think, the luxury and we don't take it for granted, it's because of the performance of the teams, which is incredible, the luxury to be able to both invest organically, transactionally if there was something that were to fit into our long-term strategy as well as continue with the strong shareholder returns. And that at this point in time is our full intent, is to be able to accomplish that. Tristan Gresser : All right. That's very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners at Wolfe Research. Theresa Wagler : Hey, good morning, Timna. Timna Tanners : Wanted to just ask a little bit more about Sinton. If I go back in my notes, a couple years ago you were talking about being at full capacity, 3 million tons, and now you're talking about 70%, 80%. So I'm just trying to understand, is there some reason that it's no longer expected to run full out or are you just assuming like maybe some gradual ramp up? I just want to understand that better. Mark Millett : Yeah. No. That's fine. We probably have not done an elegant job of explaining that. The 70% is just the run rate at the end of this year, Timna. Again, we'll continue to ramp up. We expect to be 2.4 million tons total production next year, which I think is around over 80% of the 3 million. And then we'll continue to ramp up from there. There's absolutely no doubt that the plant capability can exceed the 3 million ton nameplate that we've advertised in the past. Theresa Wagler : And I guess just to bring a little bit more clarity to that. We would expect to be operating around that full capacity by the middle of 2024, Mark's just giving a total year view. Timna Tanners : Helpful. Okay. Thank you. One other timing question was really on the downstream lines that are going to really enrich your product mix. And in the presentation it says they're starting in the second half, but I thought I heard you saying they were contributing more in the first half. So just trying to get the cadence of when that ramps up. Theresa Wagler : Yeah. It probably should have been updated in the investor deck. I'm guessing that's what you're pointing toward. We're planning to have the Heartland paint line and the Heartland galvanizing line running first, which could be towards the end of 2023. But probably moving into that first month and a half in 2024 and then very closely thereafter, Sinton's additional paint line and galvanizing line will be starting as well still within the first quarter of 2024. Timna Tanners : Great. Thanks. And then the last question, if I could squeeze it in is just on the CapEx guidance. I think we had -- last quarter you had talked about a number for 2024 of about 1.5 billion and just with the higher CapEx guide for Q4, we just wanted to check on if that number is still right for 2024. Thanks again. Theresa Wagler : You're welcome, Timna. Actually, we're in the middle of planning for 2024 on the capital investment side right now. It looks like it's going to be closer to $1.8 billion to possibly $2 billion. I'll be able to put a finer point on that as we get through the first quarter, but it's primarily comprised of a little bit more on the aluminum side just from a timing perspective, not a total investment. So aluminum may be as much as $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion next year. We also have the construction and startup of the biocarbon facility, which could be as much as $150 million to $175 million. And then we have some tail to the four value added lines as well of maybe a $100 million. So I will be putting a finer point on that, but right now I'd say it's probably in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Timna Tanners : Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Bill Peterson with JP Morgan. Bill Peterson : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. We've been seeing some reports that the US and Europe are ahead of this summit tomorrow. Maybe looking at removing some of the tariffs or adjusting quotas and things like that. I guess, assuming that some of this does happen and quotas go away, how would you see this impacting the US steel market? Mark Millett : Well, I guess we don't have the same intelligence that others have from our folks on the hill and just conversations. It really seems still up in the air. The European position and the US position are totally at odds, and not much progress has been made, but maybe you are wrong. That said, obviously the tariffs today, a lot of that has been negotiated away in only probably 25% or so of incoming, steel imports are affected by that. And obviously quotas are in place with Brazil and here and others. I would imagine that they will remain in place in some form of fashion. European tariffs maybe that is a little different, but Europe is not really a influence on our market, in all honesty. If you look at the straightforward arbitrage today between -- well, Asian pricing and European pricing, not that that attractive. We don't necessarily see a big influence there. We do feel strongly that any tariff and quota type activity will transition into some form of carbon tax on border tax. Actually, in the long run will likely be a lot more effective than the perhaps was in place today. Again, we need to remember and highlight that the principal trade constraints, the countervailing duty anti-dumping cases that were brought in 2015 went through sunset last summer and got continued. I think it's another five years. Those are legislative in nature. They won't change. They firmly, firmly, or eliminate these imports, for instance, certainly in addition with, or in concert with the kind availing duty. Bill Peterson : Okay. Thanks for that color. Second question. So on bar volume, so you mentioned that there's some impact with the strike, but the strike really only started, I guess in late in the third quarter. So how should we think about the trajectory of volumes, assuming a bigger hit in the fourth quarter for that segment? Mark Millett : Well, for us, we don't really see a major change in volume from an automotive perspective in the fourth quarter for us. As I mentioned in my notes, we have a large percentage of our auto book is European and Asian. They are not impacted by the strike as of now. We are -- we do have some business with Aymium and with Ford. But again, on a percentage basis, it's not going to be monumental to our book volume or earnings. Bill Peterson : Okay. Thanks for sharing the insights. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. David Lipschitz : Hi, John. Unidentified Analyst : With all the great dynamics benefiting the steel business, industry-wide apparent demand looks like it's trending about 8 million tons below the average of 2017, 2018, 2019. I don't know what's normal, but I'm looking to the pre-pandemic period. Your own choice business is off 16,000 tons sequentially, and I guess 56,000 tons year-on-year. And there's no inventories in choice because they're made custom order. What are the segments that are down that are negating some of the other growth or accounting for the decline? A high rise office building with work at home with lower consumer spending, ecommerce warehouses and retail space are poor. Are there any other segments that could account for the deviations? Mark Millett : Well, I think from a -- we got some feedback going on here, but the -- we're talking principally fabrication here. Yeah. I think it -- when -- again, all we can do John, is look through our book order book or lands, but obviously the distribution warehouse arena has come off, not stopped. It's not -- Amazon obviously came out very publicly and sort of almost holding the development because they over bill, but that's not the case with other distributors. It's still ongoing market for us. All of them is there. But I think we picked it up education, healthcare has been positive and the just manufacture -- manufacturing facilities, the battery plants, the chip plants are picking up. Not at the rate to offset, totally offset that distribution base, but nonetheless, it's picking up strongly and we would anticipate continued growth next year. Just the infrastructure, the IRA spending that certainly will bolster our order book there and give it some support. Unidentified Analyst : In terms of the two-year decline in spot sheet prices of $1,200 from big records, how much damage do you think that's caused across consumer and distributor inventory as you know, and prices fall, people don't want to hold the hot potato. Mark Millett : Well, I think the biggest impact is the reduced level of speculation in the supply chain. In fact, it's not a reduced level of speculation. People just don't speculate anymore. So you see people that's kind of hand in mouth. They tend to be ordering and buying on as needed basis that, that allows consistent shipping since July, mid-July, where we've seen very, very, very consistent order input rates and deliveries. Even as pricing came off the pricing this time and just as it was last year, last year with had a similar story with a very constructive outlook for 2023, which in all honesty came to fruition. The emotion last year was [indiscernible] us, we're headed for a recession and we got high interest rates, inflation, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There was no change, no structural change in underlying demand in the fourth quarter of last year. We're seeing the same thing today. Demand is very, very solid across virtually every market sector that we have. Yet we see -- saw that softness strike related emotional. People are starting to see lead time stretch out. They're starting to see, or get a little worried. We're booked out. And essentially our order book is closed for November. And given the interest, we see for December, we haven't opened that book yet., We're not so sure we will be able to satisfy the total appetite there. So it's a positive market momentum going into 2024. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. I'm a shareholder. Mark Millett : Thank you. Stay that way. Operator : [Operator Instructions] That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. End of Q&A: Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Holly. And for anyone that remains on the line, I would tell you I am blessed. SDI is blessed. Each and every one of us is blessed here because we have phenomenal loyal customers. Thank you for your support today and in the future. We have great service providers. We've got a phenomenal, phenomenal team of people that come to work, as I said earlier, inspired and positive each and every day. So thank you. Thank you for those that our shareholders and those on, I would hope that you consider us because we will create better shareholder value than most folks in the years ahead. So thank you very much. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

And now, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being with us on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. As you saw on our release, our teams achieved a strong annual 2023 financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving our best safety year with the lowest recordable incident rate ever. I want to applaud and congratulate all the teams because that it was a monumental effort put into get it. Steel shipments were record 12.8 million tons. I think, it needs to be emphasized that we've got 3 million tons yet of additional shipping capability to leverage. We have the second best year for revenues at $18.8 billion and cash flow from operations of $3.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.7 billion. I think, the year clearly demonstrated the through cycle earnings resilience of our business model. It's manifest by a diverse value add product portfolio supported by a superior operating culture, driving world class low cost operations. I can be more pleased at Sinton. Sinton is showing significant operating improvement was EBITDA positive in December, with a clear path to profitability in the first quarter of 2024 and thereafter. We're also achieving fast paced progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics. So the aluminum industry is considering a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. I'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They're the foundation of our company and they drive our success. And to be honest, they inspire me. Feeling they were esprit de core and commitment to the SDI family during the recent holiday parties was absolutely just simply humbling. And that is why we were so focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. They're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind in an active conversation each and every day. As I already suggested, with that focus, the team's safety performance was a record low incident rate in 2023. Obviously, though there's more to do, we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. So that said, I will hand it to Theresa, who will then bet the ball to Barry and then back to me to finish up. So Theresa? Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for being with us today. In addition to the achievements Mark just mentioned, the teams also achieved our third best year for operating income of $3.2 billion and net income of $2.5 billion or $14.64 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations and liquidity of $3.5 billion and a three year after tax return on invested capital of 32%. A truly great performance, my sincere thank you and congratulations to our entire team. As for the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $424 million, or $2.61 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $659 million. Fourth quarter 2023 revenues of $4.2 billion, an operating income of $519 million were lower than sequential third quarter results driven by seasonally lower volume and realized steel and steel fabrication pricing. Our steel operations generated operating income of $365 million in the fourth quarter lower than sequential third quarter results due to lower realized flat rolled Steel pricing. Our steel shipments remain steady at 3.1 million tons. Our four new flat rolled coating lines have or will begin operating this quarter, increasing our higher margin value added product mix by an additional 1 million tons, making our capacity in value added and flat roll at 7 million tons on the coating lines. For the full year of 2023, operating income from our steel operations was $1.9 billion with record annual shipments of 12.8 million tons. For those of you that track our flat rolled shipments in more specificity, hot rolled coil and P&O shipments were 927,000 tons. Cold rolled shipments, 124,000 tons and coated shipments of 1,192,000 tons. For metals recycling fourth quarter operating income was $6 million due to seasonally lower volume in nonferrous metal spread compression. For the full year, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $108 million lower than prior year results based on decreased ferrous scrap pricing more than offsetting higher volume. We're the largest nonferrous and ferrous metals recycler in all of North America, recycling aluminum, copper, and other metals. The team continues to lever our circular manufacturing operating model, providing high quality, low cost scrap to our steel mills, which improves furnace efficiency and reduces company-wide working capital. Our steel fabrication operations achieved operating income of $250 million in the fourth quarter, lower than sequential third quarter results, yet historically strong due to lower pricing and seasonally lower shipments. Our steel fabrication platform had another great year in 2023 with operating income of $1.6 billion. Congratulations to the team. Our steel joists and deck demand remained solid with good order activity. Our backlog extends through the first half of 2024 and forward pricing remains strong. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, the DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to support domestic fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel consumption and related joists and deck consumption as well. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we generated strong cash flow from operations of $865 million. For the full year, we achieved our second best annual cash flow of $3.5 billion. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable low cost structure. At the end of the year, we had liquidity of $3.5 billion. During 2023, we invested $1.7 billion in capital investments, of which almost 60% related to the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. For 2024, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to aluminum investments. During the fourth quarter, we maintained our cash dividend at $0.425 per common share after increasing at 25% in the first quarter of 2023. During the full year of 2023, we paid cash dividends of $271 million and repurchased $1.5 billion or 8% of our outstanding shares, representing a 62% net income shareholder distribution rate. The Board also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program in November, and $1.4 billion remained available at the end of the year. Since 2017, we've increased our cash dividend per share by 174%, and we've repurchased $5.5 billion of our common stock or 37% of our outstanding shares. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy. Prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with the variable share of purchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.8 billion. We are squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. Our three-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32% as a testament to our profitable growth. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities, and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We have an actionable path forward to carbon neutrality that has more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive, that then lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you for your time this morning, Barry? Barry Schneider : Thanks, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed exceptionally well throughout 2023, achieving historically strong earnings. At the end of the year, our steel joists and deck order backlog was solid extending to the first half of 2024. We continued to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs could continue to provide momentum for additional construction spending. Equally important, our customers tell us demand remains solid and share our optimism. Current pricing is stabilized at historically higher levels and order entry has improved. Fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations also perform well this year, considering the challenge of declining scrap prices throughout much of 2023. The North American Geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Particular our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They will strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our future flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand our scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime fair scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with significant advantage to materially increase recycled content for our aluminum flat roll products and increase the earnings opportunities. The steel team had another strong year achieving record volume of 12.8 million tons. During 2023, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 76%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 93% excluding the Sinton plant. We consistently operate a higher utilization due to our value added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain, and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. This higher through cycle utilization of all our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Regarding the steel markets, steel pricing improved in the fourth quarter 2023 and into January. Customer order entry rate has been strong and lead times have been extended, while their inventory levels remained at historically low amounts. In fact, our flat wheel steel operations have experienced one of the strongest order entry environments in January, especially for our value added products. Additionally, steel imports have generally remained at a manageable level with expectations of this to continue. As Sinton and the team has achieved significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They average about 65% of capability in November, December, and have been running even stronger rates here in January. We are planning for Sinton additional improvements in production after the team makes changes to certain transformers at the end of this first quarter, 2024, while we allow access to a 100% of our mill capacity versus the current 80% capacity. Additionally, the two new value added coating lines will begin operating in the first quarter, supporting increased volume and margins. Regarding the steel market environment, automotive production estimates for 2024 or estimated 16 million units, while automotive dealer inventories remain below historical norms. Non-residential construction remains solid as evidenced by the strength of shipments and backlogs at our structural rail division, and customer inventory levels are low. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide meaningful support to fixed asset investment in related construction oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, oil and gas activity is strong, driving approved orders for OCTG and solar, those areas all grow. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. With that, Mark? Mark Millett : Thanks Barry. Thanks Theresa. I think, our consistently strong through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As Barry mentioned, the four value add flat roll steel coating lines are starting this quarter, and Sinton should see a step function improvement hitting its stride in the second quarter of this year. Our aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling, responses from existing and new customers across all markets remain incredible, only strengthening as we move forward. Many customers have already indicated they would like to build facilities on our rolling mill site in Columbus, Mississippi, and this core location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money, and reducing emissions across the supply chain and has already proven itself clearly in Sinton. The project itself was 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. It's going to be a state-of-the-art plant, obviously, serving the sustainable beverage and packaging both the ore body and then TAM, automotive and industrial sectors. Roughly 300,000 metric tons of Canstar, which is about 45% of the output roughly 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 metric tons of industrial and construction products. The onsite metal cast slab capability of 600,000 metric tons will be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions, one in West, and one in Central Mexico. The expanded product scope is including additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. Our plans are on schedule, rolling mill should be mid-'25, the Mexico slab center at the end of '24, and then Arizona slab center around mid-'25. The total project cost, as you saw in the release, including the recycled slab centers has risen to $2.7 billion. The installation cost for the rolling mill has expanded due to inflationary installation costs that we are all facing. So with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we are confident in this final budget. As we've said before, 100% to be funded with cash. And the expectation is to have a through cycle annual EBITDA of around $650 million to $700 million from the [aluminum] facility with an additional $40 million to $50 million from [indiscernible]. I think we're definitely going to see superior financial metrics relative to our competition. The -- as we see it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago, other assets, little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs with inefficient high-cost operations. We're confident, we can emulate the performance-driven high-efficiency, low-cost model that drove our success in steel to drive superior financial metrics. Our organizational mill structure to just advanced layout and technology and our performance-driven sort of speed core culture will drive a census of around about 750 people versus typically 2,000 or more in a similar competitor out there. We will have higher yield through the system. We will leverage OmniSource's market position and their separation technologies to ensure higher recycled content. We obviously won't have the legacy burden that others have. We will have production cost efficiencies and along with the customer co-location. In the end, we also have a preferred sustainability profile. If you put it all together, we're confident that our earnings profile is going to be far superior to the industry today. We've developed the best financial metrics in the steel industry. And as I said, we have confidence we can do the same in aluminum. We're poised for continued growth. We have an additional 3 million tons, as I said earlier, have shipping capability that will be leveraged through our new processing lines, new products and new supply chains. And we are on passion by our future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest average five year after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. In the last three years, we had an average after-tax ROIC of 32%. I'm going to say that just doesn't happen. Our disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation and strong returns. I continue to be optimistic moving forward. I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in 2024 and the years ahead. North America will benefit from continued onshoring and manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Fuel dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joists and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. In closing, there is no doubt our teams are our foundation. And I thank each of them for their passion and dedication. We're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry and, in turn, mitigating volatility in cash flow generation through all market cycles. We're competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone, today and the years ahead. So with that said, Holly, I would love for you to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Martin Englert with Seaport Research. Martin Englert : Quick question on steel conversion. Costs were estimated around $5.30 per ton in the fourth quarter and kind of average around there for the year. Looking ahead at 1Q, taking that point of reference into account, should we expect some decline there based on the ramping of Sinton further and some better fixed cost leverage? Theresa Wagler : As the way that the information that you guys can use to back into our conversion costs, I know it's a little difficult, but you hit the primary driver with Sinton and ramping up as significantly as we're expecting them to do in the first quarter and as they are doing right now in January already, we would expect to see that overall as you calculate it conversion costs come down absent any other factors, correct? Martin Englert : Okay. And any goalpost as far as when we think about what that could potentially decline on a sequential basis? And I understand there might be other offsets there with substrate that's flowing kind of flowing through there as well. But. Theresa Wagler : No, it is really hard for us to give you guidance, as you know, Martin, as it relates to the conversion costs as you're calculating it. As conversion costs really stand within the steel operations themselves, the two conversion costs are very stable. We don't expect to see a lot of movement except for Sinton again because of the additional volumes. The substrate does have an impact, as you mentioned, but we don't expect to see that mix of processing versus production be dramatically different in the first quarter. Martin Englert : Okay. If I could one follow-up on steel fabrication in the release, you noted improved activity as well as well price backlog extending through first half of '24. On average, is the backlog price higher or lower than the fourth quarter ASP of $3,500 per ton? Theresa Wagler : Martin, the backlog prices held in very steadily. There's not a dramatic difference. And again, we don't give specific sense to the backlog pricing for fabrication or for other operations. But the resiliency and the price, both what we're seeing now and in that backlog is very steady. Mark Millett : I would just add, in the fourth quarter, and our belief is that the fabrication is kind of troughed in large part. But in the fourth quarter, we had the highest order input rate of the prior six quarters. So volumes are -- will turn. Obviously, you've got a little seasonality in Q1, but the expectation is things will go upward thereafter. Martin Englert : Your comment on you believe that its trough, does that pertain to volumes or price or volumes and price? Mark Millett : I would say that for sure, volume and pricing appears to have stabilized. Operator : Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas. Tristan Gresser : The first one is kind of a follow-up on the fabrication guidance, maybe on the volumes. If we look at the shipments you had in Q4, it's probably the lowest fab shipments we've seen in five years, and you mentioned you've seen that trough, but could you explain a little bit what is been holding you back there of late. And if we look at 2024, what kind of growth expectation do you foresee for the business? I know you provided some guidance last year on a half-on-half basis. So anything there would be helpful. That would be my first question. Mark Millett : I guess, I would just leave it as already stated, the order input rate increased in Q4. That will flow through this year. You all have as you -- I know you appreciate sort of seasonality in this first quarter with the winter months and construction being a little inhibited by the weather. But I think we will certainly see a turn into the second quarter and through the rest of the year. Tristan Gresser : All right. That's fair. And my second question is more on the CapEx hikes or the project budget hikes. I think you mentioned the aluminum, but I think the biocarbon project also the CapEx has been high. So what drove that? And when we look at this, let's say, $300 million budget hike versus prior, how should it be spread out between 2024 and 2025. I know you provided some insight on the budget for 2024, around $2 billion but there is a significant drop in consensus expectation into 2025. So it'd be helpful to get a sense of how much is flowing into 2025 for those projects? And also, do you -- when you look at this elevated CapEx budget for next year and your expectation for your several businesses, do you expect to be free cash flow positive for 2024? Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Tristan. So the biocarbon project hasn't increased in cost. It's stayed put. It stayed the same. It's $260 million. We did expect at one point in time to possibly get some tax credits that became unavailable once the definitions kind of became more precise from the administration. But otherwise, the capital cost of $260 million remains what we thought it would be. And that project is still online to be completed and to start before the end of 2024 which, as a reminder, is incredibly additive to our decarbonization path, and it's going to really help our customer base as you look at the carbon content across our steel operations with the benefit of using the biocarbon. So incredibly excited and the team is doing a fantastic job in Mississippi getting that up and running. So that will be spent primarily in 2024. And that $2 billion is a number that I would have given you last quarter as well. So that stayed the same for total CapEx in 2024. As it relates to the aluminum project, most of the incremental and it rounded to $200 million, but it was less than that in actuality. But most of that will be spent in 2024. So I gave you the spend for aluminum of about $1.4 billion. This year, and it would be our expectation. And then there would be a trailing, call it, $150 million to $200 million remaining to be spent in 2025 related to the aluminum projects. And so really nothing significant has changed on the capital front, except for that incremental addition in the aluminum project itself -- I'm sorry, I forgot, I had to look at my notes. You asked a lot of questions, Tristan. The last one was related to consensus for 2025. And I would just -- and free cash flow. I would just point out for everyone on the call. So for the last two years, unfortunately, Sinton has been negative from an EBITDA perspective. And Mark said on the call this morning that we will be EBITDA positive in the first quarter and thereafter, that's a significant swing in just earnings itself just as it relates to the ramp-up of Sinton. In addition to that, you have the four value-add flat roll lines that are coming online in 2024, which are significant additional opportunity for contribution to earnings on the value-added side as well as that's where the demand is today is in the painted products and the Galvalume products. And then if you couple that with the fact that we've been increasing and will continue to increase volumes in our metals recycling segment, both related to the collection of nonferrous scrap, specifically aluminum and to help service our steel mills on the ferrous side of the equation. And then finally, in 2025, we will be starting our aluminum mill, midyear is the current forecast. So that's contributing to earnings, as Mark mentioned, not we believe through cycle earnings of $650 million to $700 million. So I think everybody maybe needs to take a step back and kind of look at the opportunities that we have from an earnings perspective. And yes, we do expect to generate cash in 2024, and we expect to continue -- we plan to continue with our share repurchase program. Mark Millett : Just one added point. Although we are disappointed with the CapEx creep there at Sinton. We are very, very confident -- I mean, sorry, sorry, in Columbus aluminum. We're confident that that's the final creep, but it has no impact to schedule. To be honest, it is going at a breadth taking place, absolutely phenomenal job by the team down there. And there's no doubt we'll be up and running midyear of '25. Operator : The next question for today is coming from Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : My question is on the aluminum project. I don't know if you could maybe give a little bit of color as to what extent have you been able to contract some of the volumes that will come online in mid-2025? And what type of pricing mechanism or structure even at just high level and on a qualitative basis, have you been able to use to implement in those contracts, if you have done so? Mark Millett : Thank you, Carlos. The commercial team, in all honesty, has only been put together over the last, I would say, two months. They're very, very active with our customer base and all honestly, we all are at every level. And the reception is incredibly high. And I would suggest that we have total confidence that we're going to be able to support the ramp-up in '25 into '26. Carlos De Alba : And if I may ask on the -- what is the expected ramp-up and EBITDA contribution for the four quarter lines? I mean, I think two of them will start in the first quarter. Theresa Wagler : As far as the ramp-up, I'll let Barry address how quickly they ramp up. I would tell you from a financial perspective, the coating lines, they are in totality, all four, around $600 million and they tend to have a 2.5 to 3-year payback. So it's very nice returns. Barry Schneider : Yes, this is Barry. I'd just like to add the teams, the personnel are in place. They've been training, building the lines. That's our culture to be part of the construction. So the teams are already very familiar with the equipment. Two of the lines have actually run first coils, one at Heartland, the paint line and a coating line down in Sinton. So that's great news. That's always exhilarating for the teams to get that point. The next two lines are in hot commissioning now, and we anticipate those running first coils in the March time frame. So the ramp-up, keep product for them, we're pretty aggressive in what we do typically, and we anticipate these will be contributing to our customers here in the near future. I envision prime sales in Q1 from the two lines that have run first coils, and we see all four of the lines making and shipping salable goods into the marketplace in Q2. So we anticipate our experience and our culture will allow these startups to be very, very seamless. And we're very responsible to our customers to make sure the product that's leaving is nothing less than the best they expect from us. Mark Millett : When you think about the four lines or particularly the two lines in Sinton, obviously, it's going to expand our value-add sort of product portfolio down there and enhance the margin directly there. But as importantly, it will allow us to fully utilize the downstream lines. So yes, the team has done a phenomenal job on the hot side. The -- you're going to see great gains there through increased utilization. As Barry said, we're knocking on 75% utilization today in January and 80% is right around the corner. But downstream, when you take that product, you pickle it, you put it through the time mill and other lines. Having the additional what is 300,000, 400,000 tons of downstream. That's going to allow probably loading of those downstream lines and obviously a dilution of the cost structure. So it's a very, very important and effective impact to some here in the next three or four or five months. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I wanted to ask about -- I wanted to follow -up and just -- I know you mentioned that you thought volumes had hit bottom and prices were stabilizing. Do we have kind of the effect of the higher price from the -- into the fourth quarter hitting in the first quarter? Or is that more of a second quarter phenomenon? So that was my first question -- asking about costs from throughput from the hot-rolled side. Theresa Wagler : Okay. Yes. So [indiscernible] though, you were talking about fabrication, you're actually talking about flat roll. So the -- we're operating contract business lagging, let's call it, two to three months. So the increased pricing that we saw in flat roll in the fourth quarter is going to be benefiting the first quarter from a contract perspective. And the 80% is -- it's really been pretty consistent all year for the flat roll operations. So we'll see that benefit Q1. Timna Tanners : Okay. That's actually really helpful, but I was asking about fabrication and the throughput of flat-rolled price increases and the impact on margins on downstream. So if you could actually answer that as well, that would be great. Theresa Wagler : Sorry, I'll get this right eventually. From a cost perspective for the substrate for fabrication, they tend to have anywhere between call it, eight to ten weeks of inventory on the ground. That's the same thing that they would have had coming into the first quarter. So you're going to see some of that incremental price hike in the first quarter but you would have seen some of it in the fourth quarter as well. Timna Tanners : And then if I could, just one last one. I know Barry talked about and Mark talked about customer inventories being low. So I just don't understand that because I know that at least SMU actually had some really high inventories for December. So is that just not aligned with what you're seeing? Or can you help me understand why the difference of narrative there? Barry Schneider : Well, Timna, this is Barry. I think a lot of our relationships, especially with the galvanized and the pain at are very directly with customers. So we see our supply chains still needing to fill orders at a really good rate. So the MSCI inventories still are traditionally pretty low. But more to the point or specific OEM relationships are still pulling tons from us. And when we have conversations, the lead times haven't changed at all with a vast majority of the business we do that is on these contract relationships. So I think what we're seeing out there and the nature of our inquiries make us feel like that there is a real demand out there still underneath everything we're doing. Mark Millett : And just to add to that. I think generally, we believe we are just very, very constructive for 2024 relative to steel demand. And everyone gets a little excited by maybe a little backing off of hot-band pricing here of late. But for us, flat roll continues to be very, very solid. And maybe the macro indicators may not be overly constructive right now. The order input rate in January for us has been incredibly strong. And we would, as Barry said, suggest that supply chain inventories, not just MSCI or SMU, but just supply chain in general is relatively tight. And imports are not a material factor today and won't be. We're booked out for coated and prepayment, right? It's very, very strong for us. And I think the -- again, when you look at the -- just the hot band pricing because coated, prepaint is all very, very, very strong still. It's just like recent cycles, and its more emotion than anything else, but you get that steep climb. You have exuberance hence to overshoot the market a little bit, and it just sort of retrenches itself a little bit. And I think that's where we are today. And it's not a signal as it used to be. It's not a signal as the underlying -- the structural underlying demand because there's so little spot material transacted today. Just because you have a slight erosion in hot band price, it doesn't mean to say that that's reflective of where the demand is. So for us, demand is, as I said, very, very solid throughout our sheet mills. And I also see that long products is in a very, very solid territory. Would like to congratulate the team. They had record earnings and record volumes in 2023. They've done an incredible job. They've changed the commercial approach somewhat. They've expanded their product portfolio, and that's going to support higher through-cycle volumes going forward for the long product platform as well. So I think for us, [indiscernible] quite rosy. Operator : Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth with UBS. Curtis Woodworth : Just wanted to follow-up on the fab pricing dynamic. I think at the start or maybe at the end of the first quarter of '23, you talked about pricing in the back half of the year being down 10% to 15%, and you came in down 22%. And then I think for now two quarters in a row, you have talked about price stabilization. And obviously, you mentioned the order entry getting better. So would you be willing to provide any directional color on pricing? Like should we assume that the first half -- that the backlog you've priced for the first half of this year is somewhat similar to where you were in the fourth quarter, which would be consistent with kind of what you've said in the past two quarters, that pricing has stabilized? Mark Millett : Well, I never do well in Vegas. So I don't think that given a projection is solid projection is perhaps sorry -- perhaps right. But directionally, I do believe, again, that the underlying structural demand is there. If you look at -- literally the last 18 to 24 months, you've seen these hot band pricing cycles, and they have not been driven by demand. They've been driven by motion, whether it be the threat or the anticipation of high interest rates and inflation and recession and all these sorts of things. They've been emotional pivots as opposed to demand for us. And all we can say is that we do believe strongly that the underlying demand is going to be sustained through the year, and that should support pricing. Curtis Woodworth : Okay. And then in terms of -- I think you noted the order entry in fab was the highest you've seen in the past six quarters, which is a pretty healthy statement. So I'm just curious, like what's driving that? A lot of the data we've seen in terms of warehouse starts is still somewhat negative. I know data centers is growing in other areas. But how do you characterize kind of the composition of your end market composition of fabrication demand today versus maybe how that looked 18 months ago. Theresa Wagler : Here you may have additional commentary as well, but we're seeing a lot of incremental demand on the manufacturing side. We've been talking about onshoring that is actually happening, and that does have a good impact on the steel joists and deck market. We're also seeing a lot of activity in the education side as well as in the, I'll call it, pharma or health care. And then anecdotally, you have to separate warehouses from data centers. We're continuing to see really good strength in the data center arena as well. Barry, I don't know if there's anything I'm missing. Barry Schneider : No, I'd just say that the mix is -- it's a good mix for them on the engineering side of the business to keep up with their lead times. So it -- isn't substantially different than the typical business flow that comes through it's small changes in the segments that we're serving through fabrication. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Katja Jancic with BMO. Katja Jancic : Just quickly on the aluminum segment, you started disclosing the operating loss. Can you provide some color how we should think about the cost there over the next few quarters or how it should impact you? Theresa Wagler : Katja, we did break out. So aluminum, because of the investment size, we will have a separate segment going forward. The -- we can't really give you projections on start-up losses. We expect them during 2024 to not be of significant size, and you will be able to see them. The one thing I'd note that you should recognize though, it's kind of an odd thing that's required from an accounting perspective, but those start-up losses actually get reflected in our SG&A amount. So if you see SG&A fluctuating, and maybe being higher than it is normally, it's because those start-up losses during construction are actually included in that line. Katja Jancic : But is it a fair -- fair to assume that they should come up. I think in the fourth quarter, they were around $11 million? Or is that a fair assumption over the next few quarters? Theresa Wagler : We do have a good contingent of people on the ground now. But yes, during the year because we'll be expecting to actually still start up, as Mark said, in mid-2025, you're going to be seeing headcount increase as well as additional construction activity. So yes, you should expect to see those costs rise during 2024. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alex Hacking with Citi. Alexander Hacking : On Sinton, how much of Sinton's output is currently being sold into Mexico, if I remember correctly, you were targeting something like 30% before that mill started up? Barry Schneider : Yes, we've had a very good ability to move product into Mexico. We have a very established team down there that's been serviced in our Flat Roll Group for a while, but we added a warehouse capability in Monterrey. And last year, we moved about 600,000 tons into Mexico in various industries altogether. But we're very pleased with how the business is moving. We are welcoming -- being welcomed by the customer base in Mexico. And in many cases, we've had relationships and haven't had the ability to get the tons there. Sinton provides us the opportunity not just through proximity, but through the advanced product features that we have. So we have wider, we have heavier products than we would typically have. And these products are being very well received in the various industries. I would tell you that the continued near-shoring of manufacturing in the United States is very apparent with the investments we see in Mexico and the customer base there. So it continues to go along with our strategy as being a great place to do business, and we're excited about it. Alexander Hacking : Thanks, Barry. And then just a follow-up, if I may, on the ally rolling mill. How comfortable are you with your ability to source 900,000 tons of scrap or how much you need. I'm not as familiar with the ally scrap market, but it doesn't seem like there's particularly a lot of excess scrap. And I guess like how much -- just for context, how much does OmniSource handle today, how many tons? Barry Schneider : Great question. Obviously, I think we're advantaged by having OmniSource recycled platform because today, not only are they the largest or second largest ferrous scrap recycler that they are clearly the largest nonferrous recycler and they're recycling somewhere around 500 million pounds of aluminum. We also have a secondary aluminum operation here in Fort Wayne that we're making, I don't know, 260 million pounds or thereabouts of secondary aluminum. So we're not -- it's not a new environment for us. I think we've got a great team. We've actually hired some incredible talent to supplement our already incredible talent. And so sourcing the material is not a -- we don't believe a major issue. If you look at our strategy, there are two principal kind of scrap streams, you might say. One is for the automotive industrial base. The other is for Comstock and the UBC scrap is -- well, it's highly available in California. They're a deposit state. So there's a lot of aluminum UBC scrap generated up and down the West Coast, currently either moving to Asia or to the Midwest. And similarly, in Mexico, a sort of a UBC scrap arena, so that's why we're locating two facilities, two satellite facilities in those scrap-rich areas, like the scrap at the source, molded in the freight of then moving big solid slab versus scrap to the Midwest is at around about half the price. And so we're not only advantaging ourselves on the scrap collection side but economically on getting that aluminum to the mill. Alexander Hacking : Okay. Just one follow-up, if I may. This is probably a really dumb question, but I assume the facility can handle primary as well, if required. Mark Millett : We certainly will. And you don't -- because you've got 900,000 tons of just to be clear, of cash need because the yield loss through the system, and when I say yield loss, it's not what we call of loss. This appears is just sort of a circular within the mill, you still only need roughly 650,000 tons of total input, 20% of which is primary. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. William Peterson : Just on Sinton, I think you mentioned hitting stride in the second quarter. How should we think about utilization for the full year? If I recall correctly, I think you had expected on 80% for the full year at the last quarterly earnings call. Is that still the target? Or should we assume a bit lower? Mark Millett : It's my target, Barry? Barry Schneider : No. We continue to strive for 80%. We the team is doing, as Mark said, a phenomenal job. It's a big challenge of bringing such a big asset up all at once. Transporter problems have been unfortunate, but we have several fixes in the works. Approaching the problem for both resiliency is also is getting back to full power capacity. So we remain confident that the operational levels we're going to see 80% is the target the whole team is aware of. We're all incentive to make that happen. Mark Millett : And not to complicate the math. But if you think about it in January, we're approaching 75% utilization right now, that's 75% of ultimate even though the team is handcuffed because of the lower power input. So we are quite confident to get to that 80% for the year. William Peterson : Okay. We'll plug in 84%. No, just joking. Just on the -- I guess, things like onshore and the infrastructure bill. You said this is an expectation to benefit in 2024. I guess have you seen orders. When do you expect to see orders, should we think of this more as a second half '24 to really kind of benefit you? And then between, I guess, onshoring and infrastructure, specifically, which you've seen being more impactful for you this year? Mark Millett : Just from a sort of a product mix, so to speak, the infrastructure growth. On the solar, it's already -- the solar has exploded. Renewables exploded last year, continues to grow dramatically. We were advantaged hugely both structural for the TOR tubes and also for flat roll for the support tubing. We're starting to see -- I don't think we can be specific on how that ramps up. But directionally, we're starting to see orders from bridge makers currently. And so that's -- the start, at least from my perspective, the start of a ramp-up in spend. Barry Schneider : We also see in the long products, a lot of, let's call it, foundational type structural sales. And even though it's a smaller division, Steel of West Virginia is very, very full with us right now with stuff that is tangential, whether it's solar fields, the support deal that goes in the ground or fork trucks and things like that, that go into these new factories and these new warehouses and data centers. So we do see a good bounce from that. We also see the pipeline industry in the states is picking up orders some cases for carbon sequestration lines as well as some major pipelines. So those markets are awake, and we see a lot of inquiry activity that is very exciting for us ultimately. Theresa Wagler : And just I want to encourage that there are some of you on the phone right now that may not understand that the infrastructure program and the IRA and anything related to the roads and bridges and construction, they don't really benefit long products. They benefit long products, they certainly benefit our steel & joist and deck operations. But additionally, the front roll operations have exposure to that as well, whether it's through HVAC systems or pipe and tube, like Barry just mentioned there's a lot of impact on the flat rolled side, and I would encourage you to think about that perspective as well. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from John Tumazos, a private investor. John Tumazos : Could you give us a little feedback on the potential 2025 CapEx. And with Sinton and the four coating lines in the aluminum and the carbon projects behind us, what are some of the leading candidates for the next capital investments going forward. And in particular, could you talk about growth in recycling where aluminum, copper, zinc have much lower global recycling rates than steel, in particular. Theresa Wagler : Yes, we do have projects in mind for 2025. I'm not sure that we're prepared to go into that today. I would say from the perspective of capital spending, as I mentioned earlier on the call, aluminum will probably have a tail of somewhere between, call it, $200 million and $250 million. Our teams are consistently bringing us wonderful ideas that have high returns associated with them. Again, I'll point back to our ROIC. They do a good job of giving us those projects that have really great returns. So the number for 2025, I would say would be a minimum of probably $500 million, something like that, because you do still have some sustaining capital as well, which for us is very low at around $160 million, but there's still some benefit there. Mark, I don't know if you want to add any addition to that? Mark Millett : [Indiscernible] The deal just to get the CapEx part, not the whole thing. But no, John -- and Theresa has just mentioned, we have an absolutely incredible team that continues to be innovative. And if you were to -- I don't know, just be with us or be with that team. It's incredible. We have a new digital planning technology that we're exploiting, again, not big dollars, but it's going to be an incredibly, incredibly high-margin niche business. We have two -- suffice it to say, two product segments that we're not in today in flat roll that we're exploring and they have a couple of innovative things there. So the pipeline in steel is still there, for sure. I think also -- and we've got to walk before we run. But in aluminum, I see that growth kind of paralleling the growth in steel, yes. We get on the front end, make the basic substrate, so to speak. And then from a processing standpoint, for instance, there's a massive, massive amount of the aluminum that gets prepaid today. That's an expertise of ours. You can see growth and expansion there. So I think you witnessed it, John, almost personally over the years and shared our history, but we've clearly demonstrated the ability to be innovative and grow. I would emphasize grow in a very disciplined, intentional manner. That's the only way you can get the return on invested capital numbers that we achieve. So both organically, but also through acquisition will continue to be opportunity there. But you will see us remain very, very disciplined, very, very intentional. We're not going to overpay for anything, and we're going to retain the best financial metrics in our industry. John Tumazos : As we build our financial models, if in 2025, the CapEx fell to somewhere, let's just say, for discussion in the range of $500 million to $1 billion, should we be increasing the share buyback dollars from the levels of the last several years given the drop in CapEx? Theresa Wagler : So John, we want to be super clear that we see the share buyback program is a very good tool for us to be able to use and you've seen that. So very much the dividend, we've been increasing and we increased it with increases in our structural through-cycle cash flow generation when projects come online and then we do it pretty aggressively. We want to keep that positive momentum. But then we use that share buyback program during periods of excess cash flow when we maybe have less growth in mind, but we still are very much a growth company. To Mark's point, whether that's through greenfield assets or whether that's through acquisitions. But at the same time, we have the luxury that we don't have to sacrifice the share repurchase program. We absolutely can execute on all of those things. And that's what you'll continue to see us do in 2024 and 2025, absent extraneous things. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. I'm a happy shareholder. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up question coming from Martin Englert. Martin Englert : I appreciate the time for the follow-up. Just two quick ones here. Over the last four years, seasonal sequential 1Q gain in external steel volumes averaged about 7% quarter-on-quarter based on what you're seeing with order intake in the new year here, and then also taking into account the continued ramp in Sinton and value-added lines. Should we expect something at the core, similar on a sequential basis, around 7% and then layer in the additional volumes from ramping assets. Theresa Wagler : Martin, we can't give directionality. Obviously, we had outages in the fourth quarter at two of our steel mills, and we won't have those in the first quarter. We've just mentioned that Sinton's going to be ramping up aggressively in the first quarter. So all in all, absent any significant market moves, you should expect to see incremental volume from our steel operations. And as Barry pointed out, with the additional value-added lines, you're going to start to see that product mix get richer and richer. So it will go more into the processing lines. You'll eventually see some really great spread enhancement throughout the year as well? Martin Englert : What were the outages in 4Q? And assume that you mentioned it because it did have an adverse impact on volumes? Theresa Wagler : Martin, they weren't -- they were just normal outages. We take outages at our foot roll mills and in our long product mills. They weren't anything that were -- we didn't note them as far as from a volume perspective. But yes, obviously, when you have outages that does impact volume, but there was nothing of significance to note. Martin Englert : One last one, if I could, on the aluminum project. Based on the two cycle estimate to give implied EBITDA of around $900 to $1,000 per ton, when you were coming up with that analysis, are you able to share what you think the bottom and top quartile of profitability might look like when we think about peak to trough? Theresa Wagler : No, Martin, we're not. We do mid-cycle through cycle. And as we get more familiar, we just -- we don't provide that type of information. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, everyone, and thank you, Holly, and thank you, everyone, on the call. I guess, as John noted, he's a happy shareholder. To be honest, everyone at SDI are happy shareholders because we all are equity holders and as part of the compensation for each and every one of us. Collectively, we do own a reasonable amount of our stock. And I would just emphasize that we treat your dollars just like they are our own. And we're absolutely focused on continuing to outstrip our competition relative to shareholder value creation through the cycle but we can't do it on our own. So any customers listening at thank you for your support. We have loyal support, and it takes us through the cycles suppliers can do it without you and got to stress. We have the best metals team in the world. Our people are absolutely phenomenal. Thank you for what you do each and every day. For those that are owners on the call as well. Thank you for your support. Have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised this call is being recorded today, April 24, 2024, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Matthew. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually. Some of today's statements, which speak only as of this date, may be forward-looking and predictive, typically preceded by believe, expect, anticipate or words of similar meaning. They are intended to be protected by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 should actual results turn out differently. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with anticipated project returns and our steel, metal recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the Internet at www.sec.gov and, if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports First Quarter 2024 Results. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Super. Thanks, David, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you for our first quarter '24 earnings call today. Once again, our teams achieved a strong first quarter financial and operational performance. Quarterly steel shipments was a near-record 3.3 million tons. The team successfully began operating our 4 new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines, which adds about 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification to our portfolio. The Sinton team continues to make significant headway hitting record milestones and achieving positive EBITDA for the quarter, with significant improvements on the way. And we're also making fast progress on our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution provided by Steel Dynamics, as we are a well-known and highly regarded metals producer. And financially, the team continues to excel. They consistently achieve superior financial metrics and best-in-class return on invested capital. It's a product of the passionate can-do performance-driven culture and our high-margin value-added growth strategy. A stark and persuasive indicator of the effectiveness of our business model is our relative EBITDA per employee generation, which is substantially higher than any of our competition.  I'm incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company, and they drive our success, and I'm proud to stand among them. They are special and we're focused on providing the very best for their health, safety and welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level of our company, keeping safety top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. Despite excellent safety performance compared to industry peers, there's more to do. We will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of 0 injuries. With that, Theresa, would you like to give us some color on the quarter? Theresa Wagler : Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I add my sincere thanks to our teams for another strong performance. Our first quarter 2024 net income was $584 million or $3.67 per diluted share, with adjusted EBITDA of $879 million. First quarter 2024 revenue of $4.7 billion was 11% higher than sequential fourth quarter results, supported by strong volume and higher realized selling values across the steel platform. Our first quarter operating income of $751 million was 45% higher than fourth quarter results, driven by steel metal spread expansion, especially within our flat-rolled operations.  A quick note, as we construct the aluminum facilities, noncapitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. So you will see increased costs in that line item as we start operations mid-2025. In the first quarter, that additional amount was about $14 million. As we discuss our business this morning, we see positive industry fundamentals for 2024 and beyond, and we're focused toward our continued transformational growth initiatives. Our Sinton, Texas flat-rolled steel division operated close to 70% of capacity for the quarter, and, as Mark said, generated positive earnings. Our steel operations generated strong operating income of $675 million in the first quarter, supported by near-record shipments and increased realized product pricing.  For those of you who track flat-rolled products by type, in the first quarter, hot-rolled shipments were 1.62 million tons, cold-rolled shipments were 130,000 tons and coated shipments were 1.220 million tons. Operating income from our metals recycling operations was $23 million, significantly higher than sequential fourth quarter results as increased domestic steel demand supported higher volumes. As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler, processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations as well as shortly, our aluminum flat-rolled operations.  Our steel fabrication segment achieved strong operating income of $178 million in the first quarter, lower than sequential fourth quarter results due to weather impacted and seasonally lower shipments and metal spread compression as realized pricing declined and steel raw material input cost increased.  Our joist and deck backlog extends through the third quarter 2024 with strong forward pricing, and pricing has stabilized at historically strong levels during the quarter. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act and DOE decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investments later this year and into next year, which will support our steel operations and our fabrication business. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the first quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $355 million, which was reduced by an annual company-wide profit sharing contribution of $265 million.  We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion. For 2024, we believe full year capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion, of which approximately $1.4 billion relates to our aluminum flat-rolled investments and $175 million toward our biocarbon facility.  In February, we increased our cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our increasing dividend profile as through-cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $298 million of our common stock, representing 1.5% of our outstanding shares.  At March 31, $1.1 billion remained available for our share repurchases under our new $1.5 billion plan. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program.  While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation, our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million from 2011 to 2015 to currently $2.9 billion. We've strategically placed ourselves in a position of strength to have a sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment-grade metrics. We believe our track record proves itself with an average 3-year after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, clearly a best-in-class performance across industries. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable optimized long-term value creation. Sustainability is also a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity.  In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start operating late in the fourth quarter, could decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and, we believe, considerably less expensive than they lay ahead for many of our industry peers.  Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. We plan to continue to address these matters and continue our leadership role moving forward. Barry? Barry Schneider : Thanks, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the first quarter, achieving strong earnings. At the end of the first quarter, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, current pricing has stabilized at historically high levels during the first quarter. We continue to have high expectations for the business. Continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs, should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025. Our fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical and softer demand environments, allowing for higher through-cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices.  Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the first quarter as increased demand from North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume and the team continues to grow our volume and recycled aluminum in advance of starting our new aluminum flat-rolled operations. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap-generating customers.  In particular, our Mexican recycling operations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. The steel team had a strong quarter, achieving near-record shipments of 3.3 million tons. During the first quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 77%, while our steel mills operated at 87%. We consistently operated higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing businesses.  The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing improved across our product portfolios.  However, flat rolled prices weakened early in the first quarter before recovering in March and April. Value-add flat-rolled steel pricing spreads were incredibly resilient, actually expanding during the same time frame. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers are managing to a lower inventory level, which can cause some volatility in spot prices.  As order activity increased quarter-over-quarter, our steel backlogs also improved nicely from December to March across the platform. As for Sinton, the team continues to make significant improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. They averaged around 70% of capability for the quarter, breaking monthly utilization records across the lines in March. We are planning for Sinton to see additional improvements in production as the team took several maintenance days in April.  Among other things, in the outage, we resolved certain transformer limitations, which will allow us to access 100% of our melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with excellent results. These additional lines will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year.  Regarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024 were recently revised higher to just over 16 million units with continued growth expected in 2025 and 2026. This improved forecast is based on demand resilience and stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate across the automotive supply chain.  Automotive dealer inventories are also continuing to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained solid as supported by the increased sequentially quarterly order activity and shipments at our Structural and Rail division. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction-oriented projects in the coming years.  As for the energy markets, the solar industry continues to grow and oil and gas activity is steady. However, increasing OCTG and line pipe imports created a challenging first quarter environment for the domestic producer. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing demand for 2024. Mark Millett : Thanks, Barry. Thanks, Theresa. Well, consistently strong through-cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. As mentioned, the 4 value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines are now online and in various modes of startup. And certainly, the line in Sinton was an absolute unqualified success. The team has done a phenomenal job there. And Sinton should see a step function improvement in operations and profitability as those 2 new lines ramp up after the April maintenance, which occurred actually 2 weeks ago, and that's -- they're up and running again. The aluminum strategy, our growth is especially compelling. Responses from existing and new customers across all markets remains incredible and only strengthening as we move forward. We are currently in discussions with numerous customers who wish to locate on site with us and this co-location strategy provides a sustainably competitive model for all of us, conserving time, money and reducing emissions across the supply chain. And this model has already proven itself tremendously successful in Sinton. And to just sort of review the project itself, 650,000 metric tons of aluminum flat roll capability in Columbus, Mississippi, the state-of-the-art plant, it has served the sustainable beverage and packaging sector, automotive and industrial markets as well. The roughly 300,000 metric tons a year of can stock, about 200,000 tons of auto and 150,000 tons of industrial and construction. Actually at the site in Columbus, we'll have a metal cast slab capacity of around 600,000 metric tons and that will be supported by 2 satellite facilities, one out west around Gila Bend and one in Central Mexico, which are located in scrap-rich regions. We can capture the scrap, turn it into the cast slab and transport it very, very effectively and cost efficiently to the mill itself. Expanded the project scope to include additional scrap processing and treatment to maximize aluminum recycled content. The metals recycling team has also developed a commercially viable sorting solution at volume for 5000 and 6000 series aluminum scrap, which represents an incredible competitive advantage for us.  Our startup plans have not changed. The rolling mill should be operating mid-2025, the Mexico Slab Center at the end of '24 and then Arizona mid-'25. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers remains at $2.7 billion. And with virtually all equipment and construction contracts complete, we feel confident in the expected amount of investment. We also are confident that it will add around about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an initial $40 million to $50 million from the Omni platform as well. The investment premise, if you think about it, the market environment is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. They have older assets, they've had difficulty earning their cost of capital. So there's been a little reinvestment, heavy legacy costs, inefficient and operations are typically high cost. And also a significant aluminum flat-rolled supply deficit exists in North America, which is expected to grow. And this will be the first time we've ever entered a market where there's a supply/demand gap, pretty positive for us, for sure. We have business alignment and we can leverage our core competencies of construction and operational know-how. We can lever Omni's recycling footprint. As many of you know, we're the largest aluminum scrap recycler in North America. And again, we are developing some pretty exciting new separation technologies. So it's going to be cost effective. It's a very, very high-return growth for us. Moving on, learn passion, I think, by our future growth plans, as they will continue to drive the high-return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. We have the highest, most recent 5-year average after-tax return on invested capital within the S&P 500 materials companies. And in the most recent 3 years, we have had an average of after-tax return on invested capital of 32%, which I think is a stunning number and an affirmation of the ability of all our team.  Our disciplined and intentional growth strategy, focused on differentiated value-added supply chain solutions, has provided sustainable and growing cash generation. And we'll continue to do so in the future. So I'm incredibly optimistic moving forward. I believe the market dynamics are in place to support increased demand across our operating platforms in '24. North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses. And the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, the Inflation Reduction Act and other public programs. Steel Dynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand, flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum.  As I said earlier, our teams are our foundation. I thank each and every one of them for their passion and their dedication. We are committed to them, and I remind those listening today, the safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to positively differentiate our performance, leading to best-in-class operating and financial metrics. We're no longer a simple steel company. We're an industrial metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to numerous industries that are essential to global economies. This differentiation and diversification mitigates cash generation volatility in all market cycles, as we've just seen in this past quarter. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our companies, for our customers, team members and shareholders alike, and we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today in the many years ahead.  With that said, Matthew, could you open the line up for questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Martin Englert from Seaport Research Partners. Martin Englert : Within steel, conversion costs appear to have declined a bit quarter-on-quarter. Taking into account Sinton's continued to ramp up and substrate costs going into 2Q, would you anticipate a comparable reduction in the current quarter? Theresa Wagler : Martin, the way that you and others are able to actually calculate what you call conversion costs is a little bit difficult. But yes, with the increasing production at Sinton, which we expect to continue to improve into the second quarter and the second half of the year, you will see that the additional volume will help compress costs across the spectrum, but product mix is also something that you need to take into consideration when you think about flat versus long. But we would expect to see that the conversion rate, as you calculate it, would continue to reduce. I can't speak to the exact magnitude thereof. Operator : Your next question is coming from Curt Woodworth from UBS. . Curtis Woodworth : A couple of questions on the greenfield aluminum project. Can you kind of give us a time line on where -- when you think you could get to more of an EBITDA breakeven level on the facility and what type of utilization rate you think you would need to achieve that? And then can you speak to what level of commercial commitments or arrangements that you've been able to achieve at this point? And then just lastly, I saw you kept the CapEx guidance flat at $2.7 billion, but obviously, there's been some concern just around general inflationary pressures. But do you feel -- are you seeing any upward pressure on the CapEx number? And are you pretty confident on keeping that number at $2.7 billion going forward? Mark Millett : I'll go backwards. That's the easier way. From a CapEx standpoint, as I mentioned in my sort of preliminary thoughts, virtually everything is now contracted out. We did, and you saw here some months ago, we did bump it up to that $2.7 billion with the knowledge of some inflationary pressures. Those are all baked in to that $2.7 billion, and we see no expansion on that number going forward. From a commercial arrangement perspective, we've been working, obviously, with the major sort of beer can or the beverage can consumers. We've been working with automotive as well. And we're pretty confident that we have the ability to match our customer demand with the ramp-up curve.  And as we also mentioned, operations should start mid-'25. There will be some qualifications early on. But we're confident that we can match the demand from those customers with that start-up ramp. From a standpoint of EBITDA breakeven, I would imagine that from the end of the year, I would hope we are in that position. Curtis Woodworth : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on fabrication. Last quarter, you talked about order entry improving and pricing continues to be stable. But obviously, there's still downward pressure in the business. Can you just give us a sense for maybe volumetrically, how you see things performing into 2Q? I know 1Q is always seasonally weak, and there was some weather-related disruption, but do you think you can get close to getting back to positive growth in fabrication? And then just in joist and deck in general, can you give us a sense for maybe how those products fit into some of these federal programs in terms of the CHIPS Act, IRA battery plants? Do you see any new sources of growth that could mitigate what's been somewhat of an air pocket on the warehouse side? Mark Millett : Yes. I guess the -- from our perspective, and I will let Theresa and Barry chip in here in a little bit, but from a shipment standpoint in Q4 and early Q1, shipments kind of leveled off at pre-COVID levels. We've seen some general seasonality and there's some regional weather impacts here and there.  But booking rates increased in March and are up again meaningfully in April. Backlogs are around about 6 months. So we personally consider that to be kind of a volume trough, and we think things are going to move up volume-wise in the second quarter into the rest of the year. And I think the thing to emphasize there's only been slight quarter-over-quarter price erosion.  And so for that to -- or that market strength to be there, I think it confirms our thesis that there's been a paradigm shift in through-cycle spreads. And I think we've got a very, very, very constructive view of the long-term prospects for fabrication. Theresa Wagler : I think something that I would point out in addition to what Mark said. If you look at -- and take into consideration that volumes are, to Mark's point, at a pre-COVID level, but earnings were still, from an operating income perspective, about over $1,200 per ton.  If you looked historically in a very strong market, that number might have been $150 to $200 per ton. So structurally, there has been a significant difference, and it is proving out the theory that we had that there's a structural shift. Barry, maybe you want to talk a little bit about how the programs actually go into the public dollars. Barry Schneider : A lot of these public the CHIPS Act and the IRA Act, there's a lot of work that has to happen upfront. And once those projects are -- owners are identified and engineering companies are identified, that's when this starts flowing into all the steel products, but specifically, when we look at the joist and deck, once it's a concrete kind of a plan on what's going to be built, the time line is actually pretty quick.  So when those orders start to be in place, it's typically in a kind of a 3- to 6-month window, when they start shipping. So we're encouraged by what we hear, what we communicate through the general contractors, the fabricators out in the marketplace. So again, we have a good reason to believe the second half of the year fills up nicely with these projects, as they start moving from conceptual phase to actually enter in construction phases. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Carlos de Alba : Just maybe continuing with the discussion. The long steel volumes declined quite sharply or meaningfully year-on-year. Can you maybe provide more color as to the different end markets within construction and infrastructure, that may be leading to this decline? Clearly the backdrop for the coming years, for sure, is quite solid. But at least in the first quarter, the numbers just weren't there. So any color on the different construction markets would be great. Mark Millett : Carlos, I would say, as you look at the mix across line products, as we make sections that are lighter sections, that's more responsive to what the marketplace is right now. So we've had a pretty robust level of order input. And Structural and Rail has performed pretty well.  We tend to balance between our rail production and our structural production. And I think in general, I would say the market space has changed from one of where a lot of more fabricators were directly going to mills to more of a service center type relationship. And that's, again, a more historical way to go into the market, after the busy years for the last several years with construction spending. So we see a good response from our customer base, and we have healthy backlogs in our long products right now. Carlos de Alba : And if I may ask another one on the aluminum project. Have you been able to already secure contracts with some of your customers, or that's still undergoing in terms of discussions with them? Mark Millett : Carlos, that's still under discussion. Obviously, it's a -- we're a new mill. And so there's a balance between them making sure that they feel confident that the volume is going to be there. But as I said earlier, we have commitments in place that will support -- in large part, support the first 12 to 18 months of our ramp-up. Operator : Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I'm going to ask Carlos' question a different way, if you don't mind, on the long product side. The volumes, as I see them, were sharply down from last year and the year-ago period in the first quarter. So I guess, it sounds like from the answer, you're still seeing quite strong demand. So I guess should we expect that this was a blip and that maybe there were some weather-related reasons and the rest of the year could be more consistent with past years? Or is there something that's changed in your outlook for the long products across structures, bars, those -- all those divisions would be really helpful. Mark Millett : Well, I think it's, in large part, some of the seasonality and just the weather-related issues, Timna. The -- and you saw some price adjustment here in the marketplace, whatever that was, 2 months ago? 6 weeks, 8 weeks ago. And again, that wasn't necessarily market pressure that was just absorbing sort of some discounting that leaked into the marketplace over the prior month, 2 months. We feel confident moving forward for the rest of the year in that space. Timna Tanners : Okay. So maybe particularly challenging first quarter and rest of the year looks solid, it sounds like. All right. And then my other question, if I could, was just if you could remind us about the cadence of contribution from the 4 new lines, the paint lines and the galv lines, and how to think about increasing volume and profitability would be great. Barry Schneider : Yes, Timna, the -- all 4 of the process lines at this point have actually run product. We staged the start-up to best utilize our teams and also to really focus on improving the start-up process for the other lines. So a paint line in Terre Haute is up and running well, shipping prime product. We expect that, that ramps up through second quarter, third quarter, getting up closer and closer to what the final production will be.  On the converse, the new galvanizing line down in Sinton actually started up very well. It started up in January and is solidly contributing at a very high rate already, which, as Mark said, the team has done a fabulous job getting that line making quality like that so quickly. We have an all hands on deck approach. So all the other mills are supporting the team.  And we're continually moving people through to keep the energy high. So I see the second galvanizing line in Terre Haute coming up Q2 into more operational status and progressing to the end of the year, the paint line through Q2 through Q3 at Terre Haute. And then the new paint line in Sinton, Texas will actually be maturing to the end of the year. So all 4 units will be contributing soundly in second quarter, and progressing through the third, fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is coming from Katja Jancic from BMO Capital Markets. Katja Jancic : On Sinton, can you provide a bit more color how we should think about the utilization rates in the rest of the year? Barry Schneider : As we had talked, we're about 70% through first quarter. We did take some time for a significant outage in April that was planned to, among other things, address the power problem we had with the primary side voltage at the plant. So we see a really good path to 80% progressing through operational by the end of the year, getting up in the capacity.  In front of us, we see better and better performance, routine performance every day. So as the team encounters challenges, they work through them quicker. And through all this, they remain a very safe operation, which is so important during start-up. So the team is in place, the new assets will allow us to provide the best mix possible upstream so that the efficiency of the plant can really be explored further. So we continue to be very robust on where we're going and the success of the team. Katja Jancic : Maybe I missed this, but was there a power issue during the first quarter? Barry Schneider : We had talked about the primary side power last year and having some transformers that needed to be replaced. And that equipment has very long lead times. Our team was able to secure some shorter-term solutions that we've engineered into place and done the construction. So now that the outage is over, we could put that equipment in with the power off. We look to bring the new transformer support, so that the plant has full operational capacity. We've been internally limited at about 80% of the power capability on the melting furnaces. So at this point now, this will help us remove that restriction. When it's finally utilized, it will be somewhere between now and the end of May. But this April outage was key to give us the opportunity to get the construction done to work on the high-voltage bus. It requires the whole plant to be -- have the power off. So again, great work happening. It's unfortunate. These are long-lead-time items. And we've remedied the situation that we believe contributed to it. So we're very excited this problem will be behind us here shortly. Operator : Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder from Bank of America. Lawson Winder : Mark, Theresa, Barry, thank you for today's update. Could you share with us your views on the CRC, HRC spreads that have been quite robust recently? What are your thoughts on what's driving that? And I know you don't like to guide to pricing, but what are your -- I'll try this one and ask what your thoughts are on what that might look like going forward? Mark Millett : I will start. I would just reiterate what I've always said in past calls. Coated products are gaining more and more market share just generally. And there are some pretty dynamic changes within the marketplace that is even added to that. If you think about the solar market, which is absolutely huge, huge today. You're consuming around about 25 tons of coated product per megawatt. And again, we're selling Nextracker and a whole bunch of folks. I think we're something like 300,000 tons a year or thereabouts or even higher into that marketplace. And that's coated flat roll, people turn that into tubes for the support structure of solar. So there are more and more applications being served by coated products today. It's a tight market, and it's supporting the higher spread. Barry Schneider : I'd like to add to that, Mark, too, that the teams have been diversifying our coated profile. So we have many different kinds of coatings that we offer. And those various product lines provide a very good supply solution to our customers. So the whole supply chain has been maturing for these products, and it allows us to move our tons to balance our production needs as well as where the markets are interesting.  So, we continue to believe that the spreads between coated and hot roll are -- will be attractive. And it's an area where we've really invested quite a bit of money over the last several years to make sure we have the right capabilities at our disposal and the right supply chain solutions for what the customers are asking for. Lawson Winder : Maybe if I could just ask a follow-up on your -- you've provided some commentary on fabrication order backlog and then the pricing on that and indicated it was above pre-COVID levels. Maybe if I could just try to get a little bit more color on that. Would it be fair to say that pricing in your new bookings and backlog, at least, are converging to some level, and perhaps ask how that might compare to 2023 levels? Theresa Wagler : Lawson, I don't think that we're talking about comparing to 2023 levels. I don't know if you were speaking specifically about pricing, if you are speaking about volume. But the pricing that's in the backlog and the current spot pricing that we have, they are converging, to your point, which would be expected as pricing stabilizes. Operator : Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas. Tristan Gresser : Yes. Maybe a quick follow-up just on the fab business. It was my understanding we should have seen some further moderation in ASP in Q2. You talk about the backlog stability and forward pricing, et cetera. So is this still the base case that we should see another leg down in Q2, before we stabilize? Theresa Wagler : Tristan, this is Theresa. We're not specifically giving guidance on any of our segments from an earnings perspective. We don't do that, but I'll talk to you about certain levers. So, we do expect, as Mark said earlier, and you would see this normally, but we will have higher volumes, both across fabrication steel and mills recycling, as we move through the year, which is generally the case in the second, third quarter environment as you move out of the seasonality into stronger demand periods.  So we absolutely expect to see that. There's also the potential for additional support that we believe will be there as it relates to the public funding, probably more specifically in the second half of the year and then even more impactful, at least in my opinion, in 2025, which will help provide demand -- fixed asset demand-driven increases in volumes. As it relates to the pricing and fabrication, we said that the change or the differential in pricing should start to diminish as it's been stabilized, really it starts stabilizing in middle of the fourth quarter and certainly remains so in kind of January, March, February -- sorry, January, February, March time frame. So you need to take a view on that price differential that we've kind of just helped explain. And then on the steel input costs. So they keep about 8 weeks -- probably about 8 weeks of inventory, principally flat rolled on the ground. So as that pricing has changed in the first quarter, those input costs will move into the second quarter as well. Tristan Gresser : Okay, that's really helpful. And maybe another question on the situation in Mexico. You kind of have a unique perspective there, you sell quite some volumes in the country, you're building in the country, but you're also a U.S. steel producer first. So I mean, the situation, the U.S., Mexico situation kind of worsened a bit on the trade front, talks of tariffs, retaliation. So what's your view on the latest development? Do you believe that the situation could worsen? And what are kind of your options if it does happen? Mark Millett : Well, today, we haven't seen any, I don't believe, Barry, any direct impact to our business. We grew substantial market share in Mexico last year. We shipped, I think, 600,000 tons or so down there. I think it's more of a wait-and-see situation. It's sort of a tit for tat going back and forth. But I think again, just as you saw with the U.S. MCA some years ago, the U.S. and Mexico are huge trading partners, and these things get worked out. Tristan Gresser : All right. That's clear. And maybe just the last one. You mentioned in your outlook in your prepared remarks that you expect lower imports. Can you discuss that a little bit? And there have been some discussion at the high level between the U.S. and Europe of potential carbon-based tariffs. Do you believe that's still on the table and that could potentially materialize depending on who is the next president in the United States? Barry Schneider : Well, I think our position on the carbon border adjustment mechanisms, we don't see any meaningful change in American policy. There definitely is a lot of interest in Europe and the EU will continue to go forward with their plans. After the election, we would expect that there will be some kind of a united front to find out how to keep trading with Europe. We do believe that's a good thing for us as these develop, particularly with our incredibly low sustainability position. So we have a great position to lead into these kind of tariffs. We do see certain coated products moving into the country that are concerning. And as we address those through our downstream distribution and our customer base, we are aware of where certain products are moving in the country. And we do see certain areas where it's elevated. And we're doing our best to respond to that competitive challenge, as other economies kind of flush towards us when they get soft where they are. So, we're always monitoring it. There are solutions we'll look at, but we take that on a day-by-day basis. Operator : Your next question is coming from Will Peterson from JPMorgan. William Peterson : Nice job on the quarterly execution. I wanted to talk about some of the reshoring trends but -- and also the data center buildout. You've obviously seen a big uptick in data center. But on the same side, we've seen, obviously, warehouses continue to kind of remain negative. So I guess the question is, what is the typical steel intensity you see of data centers? And how does that opportunity compare to a warehouse opportunity, again, since that's kind of normalized here recently? Barry Schneider : Bill, this is Barry. I think each project is so different. There's a lot of variables. And we provide materials to all these different types of projects. So depending on what the owner is looking for, where the data center might be located, that will affect the steel intensity. But generally, the packages aren't wildly different than warehousing. And it really depends on where they're going to go and who's designing it. So that flexibility in providing the way we look at lots of different general contractors and lots of different engineering firms, we have solutions for each of them. So as they go, they might be -- maybe think of it maybe it's a less steel-intensive job, but it might have more design work involved. And the opposite may be true where it's a straightforward design work in bigger tons. So it's really a broad spectrum across these different projects. So depending on each one, it's really hard to say. But it is definitely an area where there continues to be interest because of the artificial intelligence, all the thoughts about what's going to be needed for that cloud computing. And so we remain very interested in there, trying to provide good solutions to the various stakeholders who are building those facilities. William Peterson : Okay. So I guess it just really depends on the project. If I could ask a second question maybe to Theresa. So CapEx came in a bit lower than expected. But I guess, how should we think about the cadence of CapEx through the remainder of the year, presumably to reach the $2 billion number you've provided in the past? Theresa Wagler : Yes. The biggest chunk of capital will relate to, obviously, the aluminum investment. And we would expect to see those tick up in the second and third quarter, as equipment continues to arrive and they hit certain milestones. So you should see the bulk of that additional CapEx or remaining CapEx being in the second and the third quarter, probably about equal and then probably go down to about the same level you saw in the first quarter and the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : I see that you're not staggering the 3 aluminum slab melt shops, with 1 or 2 of them to follow. Does that mean that you have a lot of customers pent up already for the aluminum rolling mill and that you're concerned that you need the raw material because it might sell out fast? Or is Mexico slab mill getting sequenced first because your scrap collection is very advanced in Mexico? And is there a concern that it might take a little longer to develop the scrap flow in Arizona and Mississippi? Mark Millett : Well, I wish it was all absolute strategic, but some of it is just luck or bad luck, John. But firstly, the satellite mills will -- or slab plants will be pretty well focused on UBC. And so the Columbus mill itself will have to produce the 5000, 6000 automotive stuff and some of the industrial stuff.  So the Columbus mill shop, at least 1 or 2 of the furnaces will come up reasonably early. We're focused on SLP or the Mexican facility, to be honest, because that one, the property was purchased first. Everything went incredibly well. The permitting went incredibly well. And it just is in line. Our property in Arizona, to be honest, had some initial permitting, I would say, slowdown. I mean it's just a bureaucracy delay that delayed that facility by several months. John Tumazos : So it's fair to be lucky than smart. Mark Millett : I've been -- I won't tell you the language my dad used some time ago, but he called me a lucky critter, let's just put it that way. And I've been lucky all my life, and you need luck in life. So -- and the biggest luck I have is being surrounded by a phenomenal team, to be honest. So... Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you for those that remain on the call and even greater thanks for those that support us, our shareholders. For us, hopefully, we've articulated that we have a very, very constructive near term on the markets, the start-up at Sinton and other sort of growth opportunities, the 4 lines. I think what makes us even more excited, to be honest, is just a long-term competitive position. We are the -- one of the most efficient lowest-cost producers in the world. We have a very balanced, I think, product portfolio and a very balanced kind of circular manufacturing profile. So we've got a lot of pull-through volume from our downstream from fabrication and from our conversion plants.  So -- and that amounts to about 2 million tons a year today. So the pull-through volume is very, very strong. It allows us for that -- the higher and more uniform cash generation through-cycle. I think Barry said we were at 87% utilization when the industry was at 77%. And that's been a historical norm for us. And I believe the -- our position in -- from a sustainability carbon footprint perspective is a huge, huge advantage. And I don't believe everyone understands it. Our flat roll mills are reportedly and not us reporting it, but our automotive -- European automotive manufacturers are suggesting that our 2 current mills, Butler and Columbus, are likely the lowest carbon footprint of any sheet producers in the world, and Texas is going to be somewhat similar. So that's allowing us to gain huge market traction, certainly in automotive. We actually have more interest than we can support today in that arena. And if you look at the fact that we're already here and the rest of the world is spending billions and billions of dollars to get to where we are. And recent discussions with a couple of different European companies suggested to us that just their conversion from blast furnace to sort of electric arc furnace and the DRI facilities. It's likely going to increase the conversion cost by $200, $250 a ton. And if you think about where that puts us on the global cost curve, we will be absolutely at the very bottom, and it's a very envious position to be. But most importantly, long term, we would suggest that it supports much higher through-cycle spreads. We've seen it in recent years, that's going to continue. Our earnings are going to be positively impacted by it. So incredibly excited for SDI going forward.   for those, again, employees on the call, thank you, each and every one of you for everything you do each and every day. We can't be here doing what we do without you. And you all put in a tremendous quarter and truly sort of punctuated the positive combination of culture and technology in creating the best financial metrics of any steel company, I think, in the world.  Thanks to our customers. Again, we can't do it without you and our service providers and everyone else, just thank you for your support. Have a great day. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great and safe day.",

You also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Second Quarter 2024 Results. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you being with us on our second quarter \u201824 earnings call. As you likely read, our teams achieved a solid second quarter financial and operational performance. I think most gratifying was achieving another great quarter for safety. Teams have been commissioning and ramping up four new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines at a record rapid pace, which is adding 1.1 million tons of higher margin product diversification. We're experiencing some challenges in the second quarter. The Sinton team continues to make progress, gaining full access to their melting capacity this past week. Steel shipments for the quarter with 3.2 million tons, revenues were $4.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA $686 million. Cash flow from operations was $383 million. I remain incredibly proud of the Steel Dynamics\u2019 team. They are family. It's an honor and pleasure to be honest to be part of the team that looks out for one another and that strives for excellence each and every day. And that's why we're so focused on providing the very best for their health, their safety and their welfare. We're actively engaged in safety at all times and at every level, keeping it top of mind and an active conversation each and every day. That's significant impact the team continues to be deeply focused on our take controller safety program that is yielding an even better safety culture. But as I always say, there's more to do and we will not rest until we consistently achieve our goal of zero injuries. So with that said, Theresa, would you like to add some color to the quarter? Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us and thanks to teams for another followed performance. Our second quarter 2024 net income was $428 million or $2.72 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $686 million. Second quarter 2004 revenue of $4.6 billion was slightly below sequential first quarter results due to lower realized steel pricing. Our second quarter operating income of $559 million was 26% lower than first quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs. Our steel operations generated operating income of $442 million, 34% lower sequentially due to average realized pricing declining $63 to $1,138 per ton, while total shipments were generally steady. Uniquely, all of our steel mills, except for Roanoke had planned maintenance outages in the second quarter, which impacted utilization and related conversion costs for the quarter. Additionally, our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel division operated close to 60% of capacity for the quarter compared to almost 70% in the first quarter due to required outages to implement needed changes, which Barry will describe in a moment. Operating income from our mills recycling operations was $32 million, significantly higher than sequential first quarter results despite lower realized pricing as volumes increase and the team continues to gain operating efficiencies. As many of you already know, we're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and non- ferrous aluminum, copper and other metals. The team continues to effectively lever the strength of our circular manufacturing model, benefiting both our steel and metals recycling operations and shortly also our aluminum flat rolled operations. Our steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $181 million in the second quarter, slightly higher than first quarter sequential results. Earnings were supported with an 11% increase in shipments more than compensating for a 5% reduction in realized pricing. Our joists and deck backlog extends to the fourth quarter of 2024. Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, DOE, decarbonization support and manufacturing onshoring are expected to increase domestic fixed asset investment and in turn related flat and long product steel consumption and joists and deck in consumption later this year and in the coming years. A reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup, so you'll see increased costs in this line item until we start operations mid-2025. This amount was $19 million in the second quarter. Our supplemental schedule provides visibility as a separate aluminum segment. We estimate that average similar costs of approximately $25 million per quarter will occur through the first half of 2025. We have expectations to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 for our aluminum investments with plans to initially ramp with industrial type products, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We expect to be operating the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capability for the full year 2026 and full thereafter. Mark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations for aluminum investments later on the call, as well as our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the aluminum rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. We want to reaffirm the total project costs at $2.7 billion of which $1.5 billion has already been invested through June of 2024. For the remainder of 2024, we expect to invest another $900 million in the aluminum investments. And finally, in 2025, the remaining $250 million. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the second quarter of 2024, we generated cash flow from operations of $383 million. Inventories were moderately higher in the quarter as we increased product ahead of our new value-added flat roll coding lines. Additionally, estimated tax payments were $273 million in the quarter, representing a 23% cash tax rate for the first half of the year. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $2.7 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.5 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion for 2024. We believe total capital investments will be in the range of $2 billion of which we have already funded $793 million this year. In February, we increased our quarterly cash dividend 8% to $0.46 per common share, continuing our positive dividend profile as through cycle cash flow grows. We also repurchased $607 million of our common stock in 2024, representing 3% of our outstanding shares. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return strategic growth with shareholder distributions, comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complimented with a variable share repurchase program. While we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit designation. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years from an annual average of $540 million to currently $2.9 billion, excluding our large strategic sentence in aluminum investments. In July, we successfully issued $600 million of 5.375% investment grade notes with 10-year tenure. The proceeds will be used for general purposes and anticipation of repaying our $400 million notes due December, 2024. We are very pleased with the transaction. We thank those who invested. Lastly, sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy. In that regard, we remain excited about our joint venture with Aymium, a leading producer of renewable biocarbon products. We believe our first joint venture facility, which we plan to start commissioning late in the fourth quarter to decrease our steel Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35%. We uniquely have an actionable path towards carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe is considerably less expensive than may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Finally, for those of you on the call that track categories of our flat rolled steel shipments, in the second quarter, we shipped hot-rolled and P&O of 1,004,000 tons, cold rolled products of 124,000 tons and coated products of 1,245,000 tons. Barry? Barry Schneider : Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the second quarter, achieving strong earnings and steady volume aligned with first quarter results. The market segments that we participate in influence the mix of joist deck that we engineer for each job. Our team's ability to engineer and manufacture the best solution for each segment remains a core strength. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, not extending through the end of the year. We continue to have high expectations for the business, continued onshoring and manufacturing, continue with infrastructure spending and fixed asset investment related to the IRA programs should provide momentum for additional construction spending later this year and through 2025. Our steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, critical and softer demand environments allowing for higher through-cycle utilization compared to our peers, but also helps to mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operations improved earnings in the second quarter, as increased demand for North American steel producers supported higher ferrous scrap volume, more than compensating for the challenging price environment. We believe ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantaged our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings potentials. Field team had a solid quarter, achieving shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the second quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78%, while our steel mills operated at a rate of 81%. We consistently operate at higher utilization rates due to our value added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions in the support of our internal manufacturing businesses. The higher through cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized steel pricing declined across product portfolios as prices weakened throughout second quarter. However, value-added flat rolled steel pricing spreads remained very resilient during the same time frame, supporting our earnings as we already are the largest producer of these products in North America. And we are growing with the new addition of four coating lines with 1.1 million tons of additional capacity. Underlying demand remains steady, but customers remain hesitant to place orders due to the continuing decline of scrap prices throughout the quarter. Additionally, a surge in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics. However, order activity has increased over the last month, especially within the last several weeks, stabilizing our lead times, we believe this is the bottom ranch for pricing with positive moves in the future. The Sinton steel team continues to make improvements in operating efficiency and consistency. We are planning for setting to see additional improvements in production and profitability as the team took two different four day outages during the second quarter to, among other things, resolved the transform limitations we have previously discussed. The outages were necessary to install the necessary additional safety circuits and restore our electrical capacity, which will now allow us to access 100% of our the melting capacity versus the previous 80%. Also, the additional two new value line -- coating lines that's in were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations with great success, improving the mill's value added product mix and improving the operating efficiency of the facility. The additional alliance will support increased volume and margins as we head through this year. Regarding the steel market environment, North America automotive production estimates for 2024 recently revised was strong 16 million units, with continued growth expected in '25 and 2026. This forecast is based on demand resilience of stronger production results as supply chain constraints continue to dissipate. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms despite the recent cyber disruptions. Non-residential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some building types due to hesitancy around higher interest rates. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further meaningful support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented projects in the coming years. As for the energy market, the sole industry continues to grow and keep oil and gas activity steady. However, increasing OTCG and line pipe imports created a challenging second quarter environment for the domestic producers. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics for 2024. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Millett : Well, thank you, Theresa. Thank you, Barry. I appreciate that. But looking toward continued growth, our consistently strong through cycle operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies. The four value added flat rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and have performed extremely well. These types of high return investments are key to our value added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. Regarding Sinton's progress, Barry will provide some more information but the team completed a key task this week. And as we look forward to the rest of the year, we have confidence in increased volume and profitability from them. Aluminum growth strategy, I believe, is especially compelling. We're achieving fast paced progress on the construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. There continues to be strong commercial support for a new and innovative supply chain solution from Steel Dynamics for the aluminum industry has become to consider a well-known and highly regarded metals producer today. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets still remain incredible. As a quick overview of the project is a 650,000 metric ton aluminum flat rolled facility in Columbus, Mississippi. So the state-of-the-art plant and with an optimized target mix of 300,000 ton of can stock, as in tons of industrial and construction products. On-site melting and casting slab capacity to 600,000 metric tons and be supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap ridge regions. We expanded the product scope to include additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize our aluminum recycled content. Start-up plans right now for the rolling mill to start up in mid-\u201825, the Mexico slab center in the first quarter '25 with the U.S. slab center coming in online in the second half of '25. From an investment premise perspective, I think the market environment today in aluminum is similar to the domestic steel industry when we started SDI 30 years ago. It has older assets that has heavy legacy costs, the mills are somewhat inefficient and high-cost operations. As an industry that has difficulty -- or has had difficulty in earning cost of capital and hence, has little investment in facilities and new technologies over time. Different though than the steel environment 30 years ago is that there's an absolute supply deficit which exists in the market in North America, and that deficit is likely to grow. It's aligned with our business, we can leverage our core competencies of our construction and operational know-how and we can drive performance through our culture, which in turn will drive high efficiency and low-cost operation. It also levers our Omni recycling footprint. Today, Omni is the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler and has developed some very unique and innovative separation technologies that can segregate the different aluminum supply streams coming to them. So very, very cost effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us. The team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, as I said in the first quarter '25 followed by the commission on the Roanoke mill mid-\u201825, and those are both on schedule for those days. In '25, we plan to begin production with a mix heavier weighted to industrial and construction product sectors, as we qualify our can sheet and automotive products. We believe volumes for the second half of 25% will be at 50% of capacity, growing to 75% in 2026. Through the first 24 months, we will continue to transition the product mix to more can sheet in automotive targeting the 45% can sheet, 30%-35% automotive in probably 2027. We have some key can and auto customers that are keen in helping us achieve the highest quality in a shorter time as possible. And I know our team is up to it. The total project cost, including the recycled slab centers is $2.7 billion, and we are confident in the budget. Virtually all equipment and construction contracts are complete. And we also expect to add about $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA plus an additional $40 million to $50 million for the Omni recycling platform, and we are confident in our operating cost assumptions. And some of you have asked us to try and quantify these areas of savings as we've outlined them in the past and help you differentiate our project to the rest of the industry. The most significant savings are in four key areas : labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. The labor, which makes up, in our mind, about 35% of the differential, we will have a reduced workforce. We would anticipate somewhere around 750 people versus over 1,200 or more for a competitive plan today. That comes from an optimized plant layout and material flow. And we also have a central automated storage system. So when there will be no sort of human touch to the product from slab to truck, eliminating a massive amount of material handling and a huge number of folks, we drive productivity through our culture and our performance-based incentives. We obviously will not have the high legacy costs that some, again, existing competitors have today. And I would suggest that there should be no data that we can achieve these sorts of things, the productivity levels, et cetera, as we have done in steel over the years. The second differential would be recycled content and that's probably 25% of the differential. I believe can do that through levering the OmniSource platform. Again, the largest non-ferrous recycler in North America today. We already have a secondary aluminum operation that we can also lean on. The satellite facilities will also help being close to UBC rich areas. Again, I think the innovative segregation technologies that we've developed actually in-house will also allow us to increase the recycled content compared to our competitors. The third area would be yield. And I think we're being a little conservative here, but that would be about 20% of the differential. Firstly, obviously, we're going to have just a brand-new state-of-the-art facility, which will help for sure. The sculpting technology is an innovative state-of-the-art, it doesn't just rely on just shaving off a half an inch or three quarters of an inch whatever of the slab. It measures the profile of the slab, measures the quality of the slab and we will only take off what is absolutely needed. We will also be utilizing through the mill sort of supersized coils. So the less front-end tails, et cetera, yield loss there. So I think we're comfortable with the substantial improvement in yield. And then logistics are probably 10% of that. And again, locating the slab satellite lab centers next to or within UBC rich areas, allowing us to melt and cast that material and ship big, heavy, solid slab versus less dense UBC bales and then taking the yield loss there is a considerable freight advantage to that. We're excited, and I think that excitement is palpable within our company as our younger generations want to emulate our steel history and revolutionize the North American aluminum market. More generally, we're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we've consistently demonstrated over the years. A disciplined, intentional organic and acquisition strategy focused on differentiated value added supply chain solutions is providing sustainable cash generation. Near-term, the continued symptom ramp-up of four new coating lines, closely followed by our aluminum strategy will significantly increase that through cycle cash flow generation. And I'm excited looking forward. I believe that the market dynamics are in place to support long-term demand growth across all our operating platforms. As Theresa mentioned, North America will benefit from continued onshoring of manufacturing businesses and the U.S. will benefit from the allocation of public monies from the infrastructure program, Inflation Act and other public programs. Geodynamics is levered to benefit from those programs through increased steel joist and deck demand flat and long product steel demand and the associated higher demand for recycled scrap and aluminum. Furthermore, and I don't believe it should be understated, we were blessed with the best-in-class carbon footprint. Our integrated peers, both domestic and global will be spending substantial CapEx to bring their carbon footprint down. Those that are including hydrogen-based DRI, but also incur additional operating expense of some $200 per ton. This will materially steepen the global cost curve and will support higher product pricing in the future. And we, SDI being at the bottom of the cost curve will effectively expand our long-term metal spread through the cycle. In closing, our teams, as I've always said in our foundation, I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication, we are committed to them and remind them to listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. Our culture and our business model continue to positively differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. And we are no longer a pure steel company, but an integrated metals business providing enhanced supply chain solutions to the industry. In turn, mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles. We are competitively positioned and continue to focus on providing superior value for our company, our customers, team members and shareholders alike. We look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. That being said, Matt, would love to listen or here the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Just wanted to ask you, Mark, can you remind us what is the recycled content that you expect to have in the aluminum project and how that may evolve over time? Mark Millett : Well, as it depends, to be honest, on the product from an over time, it will improve, obviously. Our target for the UBC is around about 90% to 95%. UBC raw material. But for the can sheet will be 90%, 95% with a certain aim of 95%. And I think that to some degree is reliant -- is achievable because of the segregation technologies that we've developed to get differentiate the 5,000 series from other products. The automotive would be lower than that. And I think our aim would be around about 70%. Carlos De Alba : So overall, it's probably going to be something closer to 80%, 85%? Mark Millett : I've not done the math, but it had intuitively, that sounds right. Operator : Your next question is coming from Martin Englert from Seaport Research Partners. Martin Englert : For low copper shredded scrap, can you provide an update on the processing capacity within the internal network and any ongoing growth initiatives there and where you think that capability might be entering next year? Mark Millett : I think the question was the low copper [shrimp]. Yes, we're continuing to expand that to all our shredding operations. As far as the absolute volume I would just say we -- in addition to the technologies to segregate the scrap, the fare scrap, get the copper residuals out requires quite a bit of know-how in the melt shop to fully utilize that. So we've been expanding that growth down to our Mississippi mill and also into Sinton. So right now, we have a very healthy mix at our Columbus flat roll or Butler flat roll mill, where we have the requirements we need. So the investments that Omni's making takes that product even further down into the South where we can get better utilization at the other flat rolled mills. So we're very excited about the opportunity and also how to deploy it once it gets to the mills. That's -- as -- probably half of the problem is how to get it usefully into your mix in the mills. And we're making great progress on that as well. Martin Englert : Are you putting the technology in at the shredding facilities or are you co-locating it at the mills? Mark Millett : To this point, it's at the shredding facilities. And it is a series of equipment to pull the value streams out along the way. So not only does it reduce the copper in the actual scrap shred for setting to the mills, but it also allows us to obtain better recoveries in the other elements coming out of the scrap stream, the Zorba the Twitch and so forth. So at the facility is the best place to put those. And right now, that's where our focus -- our efforts have been focused. Martin Englert : And no current estimates as to how much of your capability is for processing that today? Mark Millett : I can't give you the actual number, but we're confident that we will be able to create a volume that matches our productivity of our sheet mills. Operator : Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas Exane. Tristan Gresser : The first one is on Sinton. I think back in April, you mentioned that you had that maintenance and that the transformer issue kind of -- was about to be solved. But now it seems this issue lasted for longer, as you only mentioned that you only got full capability back last week. So if you can explain a little bit of what happened and why it took longer essentially? And also was Sinton EBITDA positive in Q2? And do you expect a significant step-up in profitability into Q3? Or is that going to be a much more gradual process given the market conditions? Barry Schneider : On the outage front out in Sinton, the work we had to do take place in the high-voltage switchyard. So we bring in transmission voltage in Texas. We're the only facility in the state of Texas that actually brings in 345,000 volts. So in the early April outages, we put the concrete down it's necessary to support the equipment and made bus modifications. And as the equipment arrived, there's a protocol of both testing the equipment, pressurizing it, safely bringing it to a position where we're ready to turn it on. And during that process required us to they have the high voltage also shut off. So as we actually got the equipment fully on-site, fully installed and now turned on the equipment, there's a series of outage that comes along with that. And we kind of identified the kind of the key steps in the process. So we did have a slight delay with the hurricane situation in South Texas. And just out of prudence, we decided to make sure we weren't in the process of messing with our high-voltage system when we add hurricane winds. So we're in a much better place now. We're very comfortable that we've addressed the root cause. We put in some new safety gear that works in the electrical world, and that's as deep as I can go into it myself, I'm mechanical guy. But we're confident that we're positioned now to really fully utilize the power in the furnace. And the teams are practice-wise are up to speed. So we do see this as a big key step in getting even more productivity out of the plant. Mark Millett : And if I could add and perhaps expand a whole further. And we took a little bit of a little below in an hour's report last night with our performance there at Sinton. But I think there needs to be a recognition that we're developing the next-generation technology down there. It is an absolutely phenomenal technology and it's what the world is going to be using going forward. And the important things such as the product qualities that we wanted to achieve, the improved surface quality, the tougher higher-strength qualities produced through the moment mechanical rolling. But the productivity, the design capability from a productivity standpoint is totally proven. We can produce over 5,000 tons a shift down there. So the technology is absolutely there. All we have to do is simply increase the utilization of that facility. Tristan Gresser : So I guess Sinton was not EBITDA positive in Q2. And that means there could be a significant step-up in profitability into Q3? Theresa Wagler : Tristan, you're correct. So for the second quarter, we were basically breakeven from an EBITDA perspective. And so there's very high expectations for the second half of the year as it relates to Sinton. Tristan Gresser : And maybe a quick follow-up on that -- on the supply outlook as you bring more volume from Sinton. I mean if we look at U.S. HRC prices is down 40% from peak and margin on a spot basis. They haven't been that low for a long period of time. So I guess, why do you think that the market can absorb a higher volume from Sinton? And have you contemplated it instead reducing production more capacity at this time. And lastly, in that type of environment where some of your peers are probably much more difficult conditions, have you been able to gain market share? Barry Schneider : We're very confident that the products that we offer out of site, as Mark spoke, we had to get new technology to be able to respond to the customer base in that region. We're selling quite a bit of tons into Mexico. And a lot of these tons are heavier, higher strength steels where we find more value, and there are also products that the market needs in that region. So we've been welcomed across the different market segments with the abilities that we brought to the table there. So we do see the market being receptive to having a regional supplier. As you know, the import action in that area is particularly different. It's heightened versus the rest of the country. And so to have a local supply chain of high-value products is welcome right now for the customer base. And when I say regional, that's Mexico, we're a few short hours truck right in the Monterrey. So we continue to see good response, good results down there. And we're being very judicious with our time. We know we will develop new products in the future. But right now, we have a very good offering. And with the new value lines, both painted and galvanized capability, we're able to really penetrate further into the markets where there wasn't local providers before. So we remain really bullish on what the capability in the market is to absorb high-value tons from a regional source. Mark Millett : And to be honest, today, we can sell every time we can produce in Sinton, it's not a market restricted shipment number. And I think you also have to look at the incredible growth that will take place in demand growth that will take place in Mexico over the next few years. If you look at we -- and others talk about onshoring, reshoring, transhoring, however you want to look at it, the growth then in Mexico, you've got to be there to witness and experience is absolutely phenomenal. So the market is going to continue to grow as we anticipated back in, I think, '18 -- 2018, 2019, when we came up with the project in the first place. Operator : Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : Wanted to just one quick follow-up on different take on Sinton. Trying to understand why it's still at 75% guided in your release into second half and not full out? And then also, is there an opportunity to boost exports given that Lazarus Carnis has been down for, I think, almost 1 month, 1.5 months? Or is there any issue with the trade protections against Mexico, does that change the dynamic any? Barry Schneider : We don't see the trade dynamics changing with Mexico in the short-term. There is an effort, of course, to stop the surge, and there's been recent activity in the 232. We anticipate that the products that we're currently moving into Mexico will continue to move that way. There is a shortage in the Mexican market because of other outages that are in Mexico. So we'll continue to take advantage of opportunities where it makes sense. And as we look at the total capacity, we -- like most things, as a steel plant, it's not a light switch, we just turn on. So as we look towards growing through the second half of the year, we believe as we look at the second half, we're going to achieve those utilization rates. Operator : Your next question is coming from Katja Jancic from BMO. Katja Jancic : Maybe going back to the aluminum rolling mill for a bit. I think you mentioned that initially, the mix is going to be more tilted to industrial products. Can you talk a little bit -- is there a margin difference between industrial products, the can sheet and auto markets products? MarkMillett : Yes. I guess the thinner margins tend to be in can sheet, if you were to stack them, again, because of the just the volume of that product. The industrial products, particularly if we were to put them through our paint lines are going to be as valuable as any of the outputs. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrew Keches from Barclays. Andrew Keches : A question for Theresa. Look, you've refinanced the 2024 notes or maybe even some of the '25. You generally just seem to be in a pretty favorable balance sheet position right now that you've been upgraded by two of the agencies in the past year. You got another positive, you through a lot of the aluminum spending, leverage is still pretty low and you'll get the cash flow benefit from that probably by the end of '25 or '26, it sounds like. So I guess just taking a step back, can you just give us an update in terms of what the direction of the balance sheet is from here? Do you see the capacity to carry more leverage knowing how leverage has been relatively conservative at low pricing points? Or do you want to preserve some optionality for future opportunities? I guess that's a hidden second question on what the pipeline might look like for you. Theresa Wagler : So yes, the balance sheet does have extra capacity for leverage. As you know, ahead of large projects, organic projects, specifically like Sinton at just under $2 billion and now the aluminum investments at $2.7 billion. We like to be a little more conservative with the balance sheet and build cash in advance of those investments so that we can make sure that we still have optionality for growth if there would be a downturn, because we like to have that optionality, you tend to get better value and better valuations and return in a weaker demand environment. So there is room on the balance sheet. And that's why we've been able to actually stay consistent and grow the shareholder distributions during these high-growth period, which is very important to us and we think is very beneficial to the shareholders as well. So we -- you will likely see us continue -- well, you will see us continue with our strong shareholder distributions. There are other opportunities for growth. There are some organic opportunities that the teams are talking about, they're not nearly at the size or scope of aluminum at Sinton, but they are absolutely beneficial differentiating high return, et cetera. In addition to that, we do believe that there could be some optionality in transactions. We're very particular. We're very disciplined as it relates to acquisitions, ensuring that there is an appropriate valuation and return for Steel Dynamics. So you do see us being more disciplined than some others in the industry. But that being said, we think that there will be some opportunities along those lines as well. So I would just say more of the same, yet at the same time, we understand that the balance sheet is there to use. Operator : Your next question is coming from Bill Peterson from JPMorgan. Bill Peterson : I guess the question is, when do you expect to lock in long-term contracts for the rolling mill maybe across the markets as well as can you update us on your latest thoughts in terms of the qualification time line for packaging and automotive, those markets? How long it will take to kind of just qualify in those markets? Mark Millett : As we say, I said earlier, the initial material for qualification of the can sheet and auto will start in '25. As you can recognize, the consumer base is not necessarily going to dedicate long, long, long contracts at that moment in time. But come to the end of '26 would expect the longer-term contracts, which in those markets are three, four years duration would be in '26. Theresa Wagler : I would just add to that, that we have -- there's a very extensive both demand draw and plan in place for 2025 and 2026 purposely with a numerous number of customers that have already indicated volumes that they would have available to us, for all of the industrial for the automotive and for the can sheet. So it's a very robust commercial dialogue that we're having, and we feel very confident in having the ability to market those materials in the interim. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alex Hacking from Citi Investment Research. Alex Hacking : Just a clarification on the aluminum mill. When you talk about 50% utilization in '25 and 75% in '26, is that the average or that's the exit rate? Theresa Wagler : No. For the 2026, Alex, that's not the exit rate. That's for the full year. The exit rate would be close to full capacity in 2026. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Concerning the total steel market, last year, indirect steel imports rose another 3 million tons. And in April and May, total steel imports, including slabs were 30% share. I didn't get it right. I thought with all the new beautiful, new electric furnace steel capacity coming online, domestic shipments would rise and imports would fall. Do you think there's a customer preference for blast furnace metal? Or do you think domestic pricing in hindsight was just too aggressive, too high. It amazes me when the customers want the foreign steel because the delivery window isn't precise, and they have to carry much more inventory and have much more steel price risk, et cetera. Mark Millett : Well, I think, John, as we see the imports, I think generally for the year, year-to-date are up like 10% or thereabouts and that the licenses are mitigating a little. The propensity is in coated products. They were up minus 60% year-to-date. And obviously, the spread, the hot band, the coated spread is still above $200 or thereabouts and our dear foreign friends have taken advantage of that to some degree. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : I just want to see if you can comment on the pricing for the backlog in the fabrication business. If I heard correctly, the backlog extends into the fourth quarter. Any color that you can offer on the pricing for that material? Theresa Wagler : Carlos, we can't be specific about that. I would tell you that from a historical basis, it's very strong on a go-forward basis, and there has been stabilization in pricing and specifically around the joist products and the decking products as well. So that's all the color we can give you. I apologize. Operator : Your next question is coming from Chris LaFemina from Jefferies. Christ LaFemina : Most of my questions have been asked, but I just had one on the cash flow in the second quarter and in particular, on the working capital build, how should we think about the reversal of that through the second half of the year? And what portion of that working capital build is a function of the aluminum mill and still ramping up? Is some of that going to kind of linger into 2025 and 2026? Theresa Wagler : None of it related to really the aluminum mill at this point in time because we're still constructing and as it relates to the San Luis Potosi slab center they're just getting ready to kind of start maybe building some scrap reserves in anticipation of slab production in the first quarter of 2025. As it relates to the build, there has -- there was a structural increase in inventories related to the four value added lines as we were putting substrate in front of those lines in anticipation of ramping them up during this period of time. And so there will still be some increase as Sinton ramps up the second half of the year structurally, but there is also availability of inventory reduction at the long product steel mills and some of the other areas. So I would expect to see working capital not be a significant draw in the second half of the year, but rather potentially be either not neutral or a funding source. The biggest part of the moving cash flow was really our estimated tax payments in the quarter. Operator : Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I was also asking about cash flow. If we think about the $1.2 billion remaining CapEx in the second half, the $400 million debt pay down, I'm just trying to think about if you want to keep the buyback steady as you have over the last several quarters? Or if there's any shifts that you might make to your capital allocation policy given those big uses of cash? Theresa Wagler : We're very comfortable with our cash flow generation capability at this point in time, given what we can see, there's no expectation of changing our capital allocation policy for the remainder of the year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alex Hacking from Citi Investment Research. Alex Hacking : I'm just curious in your perspective or are you concerned about some of the rhetoric around Mexico and the steel trade with Mexico. The U.S. is a net export for flat steel to Mexico, right? Sinton is targeting Mexico for off take. Are you concerned that some of the rhetoric that's sprung up recently could lead to more tariffs, retaliatory tariffs. And is that a potential risk that you're considering? Or how do you think about that? Mark Millett : Well, I guess from my perspective, there's certainly some noise and perhaps short-term aggravations going back and forth. But longer term, as I said earlier, the growth -- the steel demand growth within Mexico is going to continue to be considerable. They're going to continue to be still short. They're going to need our products. In particular, they're going to need our coated and downstream products, perhaps more -- a little more so than hot band. But they're going to be still short and in the big picture, I don't see a material problem now. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well, again, thank you, everyone. I just want to close and saying, I think SDI, it's an incredible company doing incredible things. We couldn't do it without our inspirational teams and their families. We can't do it without the support of our loyal customers. We will continue to work with you to create innovative value creating opportunities for you, both of things you need today and what you may not even know you need tomorrow. And again, we need the support of our service providers that you folks are integral with everything we do. And for those that are shareholders, thank you for your faith in us. We treat your investment as our own, and we will continue to grow our company wisely. Thank you. Have a great day. Be safe. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",

Please be advised that this call is being recorded today, October 17, 2024, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to David Lipschitz, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. David Lipschitz : Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and welcome to Steel Dynamics' Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded and will be available on our website for replay later today. Leading today's call are Mark Millett, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Steel Dynamics; Theresa Wagler, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Barry Schneider, President and Chief Operating Officer. The other members of our senior leadership team are joining us on the call individually.

Such statements involve risks and uncertainties related to integrating or starting up new assets, the aluminum industry, the use of estimates and assumptions in connection with our anticipated project returns in our steel, metals recycling and fabrication businesses as well as to general business and economic conditions. Examples of these are described in the related press release as well as in our annually filed SEC Form 10-K under the headings Forward-looking Statements and Risk Factors, found on the Internet at www.sec.gov, and if applicable, in any later SEC Form 10-Q. You will also find any referenced non-GAAP financial measures reconciled to the most directly compared GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday entitled Steel Dynamics Reports Third Quarter 2021 Results. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter '24 earnings call. As you have read and seemingly many have concluded, our teams executed well through the quarter, achieving another solid financial and operational performance. Most gratifying to us to me, in particular, was achieving another great quarter for safety. The ramp-ups of our 4 new value-add flat-rolled steel coating lines have been an unqualified success with the expectation of full earnings benefit in 2025. These lines represent an additional 1.1 million tons of higher-margin product diversification for us. In Texas, despite a couple of challenges early in the quarter, the Sinton team gained considerable momentum, running at a 72% utilization rate of scheduled run time in September. We had extended periods in excess of 90%, and were achieved during that quarter. And I think it proves the mill's ultimate capability. Steel shipments were 3.2 million tonnes, third quarter revenues, $4.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $557 million and cash flow from operations of $760 million. As I stated, we had a great quarter in terms of safety. Historically, the summer months can be a challenging period, but the teams reversed that trend this year with an excellent performance. Not only was that trend reversed that both our total recordable incident rate and lost time rates were the lowest in our history. Our employee dedication to our tape controller safety program is extraordinary. Our core safety teams visited 30 facilities in the third quarter alone, which is, I think, a clear testament to their commitment to keep each other safe. We continue to build a world-class safety culture and the positive results have been clearly demonstrated. 84% of our locations in the third quarter did not have a recordable injury. That's 104 locations out of our 124 and 94% of them did not have a lost time incident. I'm continually inspired by the commitment of our team members have for one another. They really truly consider themselves family and challenge the status quo every day to do better in every way. That's why we are so focused on providing the very best for the health, the safety and their welfare. That said, there's still a lot of work to do as we strive toward a 0 incident environment. But with that, I will pause for Theresa first and then Barry to add color for the quarter. Theresa Wagler : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. We really do appreciate you taking the time to be on the call with us this morning. And I want to add my thanks to our teams for a really solid performance this quarter. As Mark suggested, our third quarter 2024 net income was $318 million or $2.05 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $557 million. Third quarter 2024 revenue of $4.3 billion was below sequential second quarter results due to lower realized flat-rolled steel pricing tied to lagging contractual volume. Our third quarter operating income of $395 million, was 29% lower than sequential second quarter results driven by steel metal spread contraction as average realized pricing declined more than scrap raw material costs in the quarter. Our steel operations generated operating income of $305 million in the third quarter, lower than sequential results due to average realized pricing declining $79 and to $1,059 per ton, while total shipments were steady as increased flat-rolled volume offset lower structural and SBQ volume. For those of you that track our individual flat-rolled shipments quarter-by-quarter, in the third quarter, hot-rolled shipments were 942,000 tons. Cold-rolled shipments were 118,000 tons and coated shipments were 1,335 000 tons. For metals recycling operating income was $12 million, lower than sequential second quarter results due to lower realized pricing and volume. In addition, we had an unrealized noncash copper hedging loss of $10 million in September. We're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other metals, and we're growing in support of our increased steel and planned aluminum production investments through new and expanded relationships and through the use of innovative new separation technologies, I'm really proud of the team. They're also reducing operating costs very effectively. Our steel fabrication team achieved strong operating income of $166 million in the third quarter lower than second quarter results as a 5% decrease in realized pricing offset steady shipments. Order activity in the third quarter was the strongest we've seen this year, supporting our Joist Index backlog extending through the first quarter of 2025. As interest rates decline in public funding begins to be distributed post election and into 2025 and we expect to see increased fixed asset investment and corresponding demand drivers for steel and steel fabrication products next year. Regarding our aluminum investments, as a reminder, as we construct the aluminum facilities, non-capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. As a result, our SG&A will be higher until we start operations in 2025. You have visibility to this amount provided in our supplemental data schedule for the third quarter, it was $24 million. We have expectations for aluminum investments to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 and plan to operate the rolling mill at approximately 75% of its capacity in 2026. Mark is going to provide more details related to our ramp and product mix expectations later on the call as well as define our differentiated cost expectations. The construction of the rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi recycled slab center is going extremely well. Approximately $1.9 billion has already been invested through September of 2024, with expectations of funding between $350 million to $400 million in the fourth quarter and the remainder then to be spent in the first half of 2025. Our cash generation continues to be strong based on our differentiated circular business model and highly variable cost structure. During the third quarter of 2024, we generated cash from operations of $760 million. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity of $3.1 billion, comprised of cash and short-term investments of $1.9 billion and our fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. For the fourth quarter of '24, we believe capital investments will be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Preliminarily, we believe 2025 capital investments will be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. We repurchased $970 million of our common stock year-to-date 2024, representing 4.5% of our outstanding shares and as of September 30, we have $486 million remaining available for share repurchases. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high-return strategic growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment-grade credit designation. Our track record has proven achieving 5-year after-tax return on invested capital of 24% during a period of transformational growth and strong shareholder returns. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last 5 years from an annual average of $540 million to $2.9 billion, excluding our large strategic Sinton and aluminum investments. In July, we successfully issued $600 million of investment-grade notes with a 10-year tenure in anticipation of repaying $400 million of our notes that are due this December. Before I conclude, I want to thank the decarbonization and biocarbon teams. I'm proud of them and excited about the recent announcement concerning our new certified science-based greenhouse gas emissions intensity targets for our steel mills, which are aligned with the 1.5-degree Celsius scenario set forth in the Paris agreement. In fact, our steel mills are already well ahead of that curve. We recently set both 2050 emissions intensity target, which is aligned with the International Energy Agency's net 0 by 2050 industry targets. And an interim 2030 target, which represents a 15% reduction in our greenhouse gas intensity. These targets were established using the Global Steel Climate Council's steel climate standard of which we are a founding member. The biocarbon project is also going incredibly well with expectations for a first quarter 2025 start. Sustainability is a significant part of our long-term value creation strategy, and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We're committed to operating our business with the highest integrity. We uniquely have an actionable path toward carbon neutrality that is more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive that may lay ahead for many of our industry peers. Our sustainability and carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey, and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. Thank you. Barry? Barry Schneider : Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well in the third quarter, achieving historically strong earnings and steady volume in the quarter. Our steel fabrication order backlog remains at a healthy level, extending through the first quarter of 2025. We remain optimistic as it relates to demand for the steel joist and deck markets over the next number of years. Based on a moderating interest rate environment, continued manufacturing onshoring, and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs. The uplift from this macro environment could be considerable for this platform as well as our steel operations. Our steel fabrication platform also provides meaningful volume support for our steel operations, which allows us to constantly operate at a higher through-cycle utilization rate. It also mitigates the financial risk of lower steel prices. The metals recycling team did a good job navigating a challenging marketing -- market environment in the third quarter. There were a number of domestic steel outages, which decreased ferrous scrap demand coupled with pricing volatility. Ferrous scrap prices have stabilized, and we believe should remain relatively stable through the rest of the year subject to seasonal moves. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. Our Mexican recycling locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support increased procurement of aluminum scrap for our future flat-rolled aluminum operations. Our metals recycling team is partnering even more closely with both steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through process and technology solutions. This helps mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It also provides us with a significant advantage to increase the recycled content in our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. The steel team also had a solid quarter, achieving steady shipments of 3.2 million tons. During the third quarter of 2024, the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 78% while our steel mills operated at a rate of 86%, excluding our Sinton operation. We consistently operated at higher utilization rates due to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support of our internal manufacturing business. The higher through-cycle utilization of our steel mills is one of our key competitive advantages, supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and best-in-class financial metrics. Our realized average flat-rolled steel price declined in the quarter due to contract lags, but prices stabilized and improved in the quarter. Positively, value-added flat-rolled steel pricing spreads remained resilient, supporting our earnings as we are the largest producer of these products in North America and growing. Our activity is solid heading into the fourth quarter with normal seasonal trends expected, in general, our flat-rolled steel mill lead times are actually at levels higher than we've seen over the last 6 months. Underlying steel demand remains steady, but a surge in steel imports put pressure on the supply dynamics in certain product areas, specifically for coated flat-rolled steel products. In response, we levied a trade case, and we expect to get a preliminary ruling from the ITC in a few weeks. Our Sinton, Texas, flat-rolled steel mill team successfully completed needed changes early in the quarter to access 100% of the mills north capacity. The team experienced some difficulty ramping back up after the outage. However, the reliability of the mill improved dramatically in September, and the company believes Sinton's product utilization rate will increase around 75% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Also, the additional 2 new value-added coating lines were successfully commissioned and have commenced operations, improving the mills value-add product mix and through cycle earning capability. Regarding the steel mill market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2024, where we recently revised to stable production over the next several years. Automotive dealer inventories also continue to remain below historical norms. Nonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some industries. However, we believe moderating interest rates will unlock pent-up project work and create new opportunities in 2025. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further support to fixed asset investment and related construction oriented products. As for the energy market, the solar industry continues to grow and be a meaningful part for both our Flat Rolled Products and structural sections. Oil and gas also remained steady. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics as we end 2024 and get ready to enter 2025. Mark Millett : Super. Thanks Theresa. Thank you, Barry. Well it's more than evident that our performance-driven employee-centric culture in combination with a proven highly diversified value-added business model drives superior through-cycle financial metrics. Our consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a balanced cash allocation strategy that has consistently delivered best-in-class shareholder returns. For instance, our investment strategy achieved a 3-year return on invested capital of 32% from '21 through '23 compared to only 12% per the S&P 500. And our disciplined high-return investment approach continues. As I said, the 4 value-added flat-rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and performing very well from a quality perspective. These types of high-return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. As I mentioned also, Sinton continues to improve its operational reliability, with expectations for strong production capability in 2025. Our recent aluminum growth strategy is especially compelling. The market environment in aluminum is not unlike the steel industry was when we started SDI 30-plus years ago. It has older assets, heavy legacy costs, a lot of the facilities are inefficient and high cost, and they've had -- the industry in general has had a difficulty in earning the cost of capital. And hence, there's been little investment in facilities and new technologies in recent years. But unlike our steel entry, the one huge positive is that the -- there's a significant deficit in aluminum, just in North America in general. And that deficit is expected to grow considerably. There's a clear business alignment, they leverage our core competencies. Core competency of construction and operational know-how. And one only asked to look at the drone video on our website to see the extraordinary progress the team has made to constructing the new mills. It also will leverage our performance-driven culture, driving higher efficiency and lower cost operations. It also level Omni's recycling footprint. As Theresa suggested, we're the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler. And we also are developing some in-house new technologies to separate the 5,000 and 6,000 series alloys. It's a very, very cost-effective and a high-return growth opportunity for us. Construction of the expansive rolling mill in Columbus, Mississippi, as I said, is proceeding at an extraordinary pace. And I believe the aluminum industry is now recognizing that we truly will be a force to be reckoned with. The future customer base across all sectors is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer-centric and responsive to their needs. Commercial arrangements are being put in place to match an order book to our ramp-up needs in 2025. Responses from existing and new customers across the markets remains incredible as the first for new supply. As in Sinton, we are developing an on-site industrial part to locate aluminum processing and consuming facilities. The arrangements are currently being negotiated that would create approximately 100,000 tons of annual tonne of processing capability per year. And as our project has become a visible reality and our reputation permeates the aluminum industry, aluminum professionals have been knocking at our door. And we've been building on a phenomenal team with an in-depth knowledge of aluminum operations, commercial markets, process technology and customer service. For those that may not have heard in our last call, the scope of the facility. It's a state-of-the-art 650,000 metric tonne a year aluminum flat road facility located in Columbus, Mississippi. We'll have an optimized mix of 300,000 tonnes of can start, 230,000 tonnes of auto and 130,000 tons of industrial and construction products when we're up fully running. The actual site in Columbus, Mississippi has a melt cash and lab capacity of 600,000 metric tons, and it's going to be supported by 2 satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC scrap rich regions. We expanded the project scope to include, as I said, additional scrap processing and segregation technologies to maximize aluminum recycled content. These in-house developed technologies are currently operating successfully separating the 5000 and 6000 series alloys on a commercial basis every day. The team plans to begin production of slabs in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, in the first quarter of 2025. We will commission the Columbus cash outs in the first quarter, downstream lines in the second quarter, with commercial shipments in mid-2025 and that is absolutely on schedule. In 2025, we plan to begin production with a product mix weighted to industrial and construction products as we qualify our Can sheet in 25 and auto products into 26. We anticipate production to grow to 50% of our annual rate by the end of 2025 and expect 75% capacity in 2026. The project is expected to add $650 million to $700 million of through-cycle annual EBITDA, and we should generate approximately $40 million to $50 million through the resegment platform in addition to that. Although this computes to a higher EBITDA per tonne than the industry has experienced in the past, we're confident in that projection. And the most significant savings are in 4 key areas : labor, recycled content, yield and logistics. Labor, we should have a reduced workforce of perhaps 700 to 750 people versus perhaps 1,200 or more in a conventional facility of this size. We have optimized plant layout and material flow. We'll have a centralized automated storage system, so there'll be no touch from slab to truck and our proven performance-based incentive-driven culture will drive high productivity, high efficiency and low cost. And we will have no legacy costs. So for those who dare the impact, I would just ask you to look at what our teams have done throughout our steel operations over the years. Recycle content. Again, we will lever our metals recycling platform to drive higher recycled content. We have the largest nonferrous operations, recycling operations as has already been stated. -- we also have a secondary aluminum facility that has been operating for many years that will be additive. We're locating satellite facilities close to the UBC rich areas to the west and in Mexico. And again, leverage the sorting technologies. The yield will be improved. We do believe it's going to be a new facility, state-of-the-art equipment and technologies. The scalping technology is absolutely state of the arm and will minimize material removal. And we're actually processing through the facility supersized coils, produce less heads, less tails, less line stops, all adding to lower yield losses. In logistics, again, locating slab centers close to rich areas will be a huge benefit as well. So the excitement within our company and particularly at the ADI sites, continues to grow as our teams recognize their ability to help revolutionize the U.S. aluminum industry as they did in steel. We're impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. The capital spending for Sinton, the 4 value ad lines and aluminum dynamics is approximately 85% complete with an estimated collective future through-cycle annual EBITDA contribution of over $1.4 billion. As a prominent institutional portfolio manager recently pointed out to us, Steel Dynamics has grown to an incredibly resilient cash-generating business, driven by the best teams in the world. We said in the last 5 years, you've invested billions of dollars in organic strategic growth. You earned a return on invested capital of 24% compared to the S&P 500 at only 12%. You've increased your cash dividend over 90%. You repurchased over 30% of your outstanding shares or the while maintaining best-in-class investment-grade credit metrics. We said it's better than a textbook capital allocation lesson. And obviously, somewhat biased, I agree. And I'm excited as investors recognize the power and consistency of our through-cycle cash generation, combined with our consistent and high return capital allocation strategy. And it's our belief that the steel industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, a shift that will further support our earnings profile. There's a pervasive sense of mercantilism, which will provide a level plan field through continued and appropriate trade relief. We have COVID-driven supply chain dislocations, which have accelerated reinsuring of manufacturing. Decarbonization should materially steepen the global cost curve, providing SDI a huge competitive advantage to gain market share and increase metal spreads as our mills have some of the lowest carbon footprints in the world. AI and cloud computing should support nonresidential construction through data center buildout. And there will be growing fixed asset investment driven by the inflation reduction chips act and other public monies. In turn, with the interest rates moderating, demand will be strong, we do believe going into and through 2025. So in closing, we've been blessed with good fortune and our people are our foundation. I thank each of them for their passion and their dedication. We're committed to them. And I remind those listening today that your safety for yourselves, your families and each other is our highest priority. Our culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're an integrated metals business, providing enhanced lower carbon supply chain solutions to our customers. in turn, mitigating volatility in our cash flow generation and providing enhanced shareholder returns and value to all participants. We truly look forward to creating new opportunities for everyone today, tomorrow and in the years ahead. So with that said, we will open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is coming from Martin Englert with Seaport Research Partners. Martin Englert : You briefly touched on this in the prepared remarks, but for the greenfield aluminum project, are there any other key personnel additions that are still needed. And could you just more broadly touch on the general labor market and how you found the process of filling the needs there. Mark Millett : Certainly, I think the there are no key folks or talent needed from a skill set of experience. We are pretty well built out, but we will always, always talk to anyone who wants to join us. So the management team, I think, is absolutely solid. It's a blend, a combination of seasoned aluminum folks, managers, leaders alongside our SDI proven leaders, and so you'll get the blend of aluminum experience and knowledge base with the cultural performance-driven sort of passion that we have within Steel Dynamics. So I'm incredibly, incredibly impressed by the team. It's actually a much better location and finding talent is not an easy thing nowadays, but compared to the challenges that we experienced in Sinton I think it's a much, much better location. Fortunately, we have one of our large flat rolled steel facilities right across the road. That's allowing again a transfer of people at all levels. And they can transfer over without moving the families and dislocating their lives. And so that is a huge benefit for us as well. So no, we're excited by the team there. Martin Englert : Excellent. If I could, one last one in steel fabrication with more recent sales that you've had that have been added into the backlog over the past month or 2, are you seeing any pockets of pricing strength relative to where you had been? Theresa Wagler : Martin, I would suggest that heading into the fourth quarter, we're going to see that normal seasonality that you typically see in anything that's tied to construction. But as we look at 2025, we definitely think that there's opportunity for not just price support, but price appreciation as we've talked about interest rate changes and additional demand coming from public funding, et cetera. So we're feeling really good with the steady aspect of what we've seen in the last 6 to 9 months. And now we'll just get through the fourth quarter seasonality and then head towards what we think is going to be a really robust 2025. Operator : Your next question is coming from Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Katja Jancic : Right now, 80% of your business is contractually based. Does that change with further symptom ramp up? Or should we continue to see about 80% contractual? Barry Schneider : Katja, this is Barry Schneider. Contractual relationships are a big part of our value-added supply chain solutions. So as we've increased our paint lines and our coating lines, it keeps that concentration about in that 70% to 80% range. We anticipated this growth with our new lines. So I would see us being in the same kind of market, perhaps a little bit less in the future once we get the established customer bases and work out the supply chains in each region. Mark Millett : Just to clarify, I think you recognize it, but the 80% contractual is on the flat rolled side of our business. We obviously have a whole bunch of other stuff being a very, very diversified provider, which is more in the kind of the spot day to day. Katja Jancic : Okay. Maybe just one quick one. Barry, I think you mentioned that Sinton had a bit of a challenge starting up after maintenance, if I'm not mistaken. What was the issue there? Barry Schneider : Just whenever we work with high-voltage systems, you have kind of a normal making sure everything is safe as you ramp up. So having the team \u2013 the outage was about 4 days. And it was just a little bit slow to get back up to regular running rates. It\u2019s not unheard of in our industry. It was just worth noting because we did so much work. The team was really resolve some of those high-power problems we\u2019ve had from the beginning, and we safely were able to do that. So all in all, I consider it a good outage the team did very well. But it wasn\u2019t like turning a light on and off. It\u2019s just a little bit more complicated with that high voltage. Operator : Your next question is coming from Tristan Gresser with BNP Paribas Exane. Tristan Gresser : First one is just on the increase in spreads in metal spreads for your long portfolio. Where did you see more strength? And maybe if you can discuss a little the differentiated outlook for your structural or shape or whatever drove that strength that would be appreciated to get your perspective on your loan product business. Barry Schneider : This is Barry. The scrap that we're able to move to our mills from the metals recycling platform is really beneficial because we find the best value and the timeliness of our supply chain allows us to really optimize that. So having the right material at the right time is essential for that business to really to get the value from it. As we look specifically at long products, our structural and heavy section mill in Columbia City is not just a heavy section mill, is also a railroad -- the largest railroad producer in the country. So we have a nice balance of where we tend to move our products. So as the markets tend to change over time, we're always able to optimize into the right product mix for the opportunity and make sure that we keep our regular customers invested and they understand what we're doing. So having that diversification of product across all of our business is essential when we're looking at how we're moderating quarter-to-quarter with the natural flow of business. So long products remains very resilient. We're excited about the opportunities that we see coming, particularly with the investment and reshoring opportunities. Tristan Gresser : All right. That's helpful. And maybe a follow-up just on the update carbonized trade case you mentioned and the potential impact of that. I understand Vietnam being part of the investigation, but I think there has been a push to include certain countries like Canada and also Mexico. And given your exposure to Mexico, can you explain a little bit the rationale behind including those countries in the investigation? Mark Millett : Yes, sir. The \u2013 there was actually 10 countries involved in the investigation. And each of those countries, there was very demonstrative increases in the actual tons that have surged through those various countries into American markets and the necessity of including Canada and Mexico, was because of the volume of tons that are coming through those countries. The U.S. MCA is a great treaty that we all enjoy. We do good business based on that. In that agreement, there is provisions to do just what we did, which is engage the ITC for antidumping and countervailing duties cases, the numbers are staggering. And in many cases, these tons are not melt to report in those countries, but they\u2019re flowing from some of the other countries listed. So as there\u2019s problems in Asia, that puts pressure on that part of the world, and they all want to flow to our shores. So this mechanism is expensive, it\u2019s lengthy, but it\u2019s necessary to make sure that the competitive markets that we have in our United States are truly fair trade. So I think the process will render out what the appropriate duties are in each country. And if there truly was less damage for some of those countries, the final tariff amounts will reflect that. So it is something that was absolutely necessary. And as we watch, we don\u2019t ask for handouts or protection. We just ask for a fair field to play the game on. And this is all part of that process. Operator : Next question is coming from Carlos Diaba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos de Alba : Maybe continuing with the conversation on the antidumping case. Somewhat related, the spread between galvanizing steel and cold-rolled coil has been depressed, you low level is probably not economical. If the antidumping investigation doesn't go your way, or even if you don't see a big improvement if it does, what is the dynamics as a leader in this sector prepared to do to maybe enhance those spreads? Barry Schneider : Carlos, this is Barry again. We do anticipate great success with these trade cases, especially with certain of these countries that were the most egregious offenders, but we routinely evaluate how we move our flat rolled products through our process lines. So we routinely move hot rolled all the way through the process into galvanized and painted. We make those decisions about where the margins are. So we've been having very good success in dealing with these pressures over the last 12 months. And you can see from our earnings results that we're finding a solution to the problem. It has to do with -- we have so much diversity in our product mix that we respond to where we can go and be safe. So I believe the ITC will come back favorable, particularly with some of the more egregious offenders and that does create an opportunity for us to go balance into a more a product mix that is more perhaps friendly to those times. Carlos de Alba : If I may squeeze another one... Mark Millett : If I could just add, you've heard us say before, we don't manage to hope nor do we manage and make strategic decisions based on, we think, trade or policy of any nature is going to go one way or the other. You have to take control of your own destiny. And I think the teams year-over-year do an absolutely phenomenal job further diversifying our product mix. I think I don't know what the recent number is 65%, 70% of our flat-rolled product mix, 65% is value add. And when we say value-add, I'm talking about really value-add. When you get into prepaint and you get into the coating developments that the teams have achieved. And most recently, they've got into this digital print stuff that literally is absolutely phenomenal. Wood grains for the Garage Door, folks and architectural. You just have to have innovation and creativity continuing to drive up the product mix. So no matter what happens, we will succeed and no matter where the trade goes, to be honest. Theresa Wagler : And the thing that Mark and Barry talked about, but without saying the exact words, the supply chain differentiation that we have. with all the products that you just spoke about. And so that's the key for us. Carlos de Alba : Right. Just if I may squeeze another one on the sea fabrication business. Any further details on pricing? I think Barry, maybe I missed this, but I think Barry talked about stable pricing from current levels from what you saw in the third quarter. But any further color there or on volumes, how you expect that going forward? Theresa Wagler : Yes, Carlos, thanks for the question. But again, we\u2019re pretty consistent. We won\u2019t talk about pricing and commercial things as it relates to that. The commercial team they would be outside my door and they\u2019d be ready to do bad things. So we can\u2019t do that. But from a volume perspective, we do expect regular seasonality here in the fourth quarter as it relates to the construction-related businesses, which deal fabrication is one. But we do expect to see much stronger volumes next year, which should support pricing as well. Operator : Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Lawson Winder : And thanks for the update today. Barry, maybe I think this question would be best directed to you. Could you just walk us through the path from 72% utilization at Sinton in September to your optimal utilization. What is that optimal fully ramp utilization? And what are the remaining bottlenecks and steps to resolve that? And if possible time lines when you hit that number? Barry Schneider : Yes. Lawson, I'll try to articulate why we have confidence in what the Sinton team is doing. And the first major thing is reducing the unplanned downtime. So when things happen, as the teams not only develop themselves as teammates, but also as competency develops, they're able to address issues that they occur. So we've been making significant strides at reducing the unplanned downtime. Necessary to make that happen is improving the reliability of the equipment in the plant. As you may know, our flat-rolled steel mills are actually coupled units where we go from the furnace to the hot rolling mill as one coupled unit. And to make that happen as various parts of the system have normal issues, it can impact the other units. So what we're seeing now and we've seen days, we've seen weeks now we've seen months of continuous reduction of unplanned downtime, better reliability of the equipment, and also just as important, making sure that all the products that are actually being produced are able to get to higher value destinations through the mill, whether it's selling it as hot rolled, cold-rolled or coated products. So as we see each of the units in the mill respond, we see the uptime increasing. We see the yields getting better and better. And as we start controlling the cost situation, we see a very good path towards this facility running well. We have had weeks that we're nearly at capacity. And that, again, is more reasons we have confidence in what we see. So we see kind of the watershed moments happening under our feet. We anticipate fourth quarter to finish strong, and it really sets the stage for 2025 to really allow this facility to show the stakeholders what they've been doing and how well they've been earning it down there. I hope that helps. Lawson Winder : Yes. The color is definitely helpful. And then maybe if I could, just a follow up to that, I think it's probably directed toward Theresa I mean when you think of Sinton now kind of being there or close to being where you need it to be and you look at the dividend consideration for February. Could we anticipate that the dividend increase in February might be more material than we've seen more recently? And then how will the aluminum dynamics start up factor into that decision effect. Theresa Wagler : That is a very good question, Lawson, a very tricky question. So the Board is who determines what the dividend will be, and you\u2019re correct. We like to keep a positive dividend profile that generally happens in the first quarter of each year. And I would anticipate the same absent any extraneous things occurring this year as well. We do expect to have certain significant EBITDA contributor next year, which it hasn\u2019t been up to this point. So that\u2019s a significant change in the earnings profile. That being said, we\u2019d like to see how Sinton operates in 2025. So I would expect to see a positive dividend move, but I can\u2019t really speak to the magnitude of that at this point in time. As it relates to the aluminum assets starting in 2025, very excited about that. As I mentioned in my prepared notes, we do expect those investments to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025, which is pretty extraordinary. So we\u2019ll really start to see that benefit 2026. So I would think that would generally be kind of a time frame to think about how that contributes to through-cycle cash flow and positive possible dividend moves. Operator : Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I wanted to probe a bit more of the status of the value-add lines ramp up, ramping up the 4 lines between paint and coated galv. Just looking at the volumes, it wasn't clear to me like what utilization you have those lines at and what we might have yet to see play out as they ramp up. Barry Schneider : Timna, this is Barry. The line -- all 4 of the new lines we added are actually operating at somewhere around 65% to 75%. As we discussed with the trade cases, we've seen some pressure in certain coated products, particularly Galvalume. So we are trying to make sure we're efficiently running those lines and making sure we don't waste money by operating it at levels that perhaps we could do with the existing lines. So what we look at is the ability to really allow each line to do the proper product mix to be very efficient and to be very good yields. So we're really excited with what we've seen. The Terre Haute operations are definitely improving the opportunity for that facility to reach more markets, diversifying that product mix there by adding a second coding opportunity with Galvalume and with the prepaying opportunity. has really opened up relationships with new customers as well as existing customers who needed those products in that region. And at Sinton, the additional lines really allow us to have a more efficient operation between our galvanized coatings and our Galvalume coatings. So it might be a bit technical, but we're really excited how the lines perform. The quality itself has been very good. And that is difficult with these type of products. These are -- a lot of this new capacity is prepainted markets, which have very demanding customer base. So we've been really excited to see how the teams have responded and the sales team continues to bring new opportunities to the mills to [indiscernible]. Theresa Wagler : Timna, as it relates to their contribution to earnings, I would say that, that really hasn't been significantly impactful up to this point. So as a reminder, the 4 lines were about a $600 million investment. And generally, the paint and galvanizing lines for us, given our supply chain differentiation have a payback period of anywhere between 2 and 3 or 2.5 years. So pretty significant. You're going to start to really see their impact in 2025, I think as everything gets ramped up. Mark Millett : And just one follow-up thought at Sinton. Obviously, the volume throughput on those lines is a little inhibited right now because the hot side not being at full capacity. So as you see, as we increase the throughput on the hot side, the volume through those 2 lines down there will increase in tandem. Timna Tanners : Okay. That's really helpful. So for modeling purposes, if we look at the, what, $1.3 million plus tons in the quarter of galvanized that represents about -- or galvanizing coated, that represents about 65% of the new capacity ramping up. So we have yet to see that remaining 1/3 or so flow through, and we would expect that conditional to the imports coming off. Is that fair? Theresa Wagler : So in that coated number, it\u2019s not just our lines that you\u2019re seeing Timna. And no, it wouldn\u2019t show like shipments of that \u2013 at that rate because you also have our our United Steel Supply and you have other processing facilities rolling through that that aren\u2019t really included in a lot of the benefit of the additional volume in the third quarter actually came through different avenues. So there\u2019s \u2013 I think \u2013 I would suggest there\u2019s more volume that still the benefit. It\u2019s not just a 1/3. Operator : Next question is coming from Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Bill Peterson : Maybe following up some of the questions around utilization and also run the last question, too. Can you help us understand if Sinton's profitability meaningfully improved in the third quarter. I think it was around breakeven in the second quarter. And then on the 4 new coating lines, are these profitable yet? And I guess obviously related to some of the trade questions you were answering earlier, but if they're not, when would you expect them to be profitable? Theresa Wagler : So from the perspective of Sinton, No. In the third quarter, because we had additional outage time that Barry actually mentioned and because we had additional maintenance costs related to that. Sinton wasn't EBITDA positive in the third quarter, but we have full expectations that it will be in the fourth quarter and certainly next year. As it relates to the lines, they're really integral into the operations of the steel mills themselves. So to answer that question a little bit difficult. Again, I would tell you, as Mark mentioned earlier, Barry and now I will for a third time, we expect the value-add lines to really benefit 2025. So as you think about your modeling, I would add that as an additional benefit for us that's outside of just normal market dynamics. Bill Peterson : Great. And on sort of the lower carbon items, and thanks for providing the color there. It looks like on the biocarbon project in particular, it looks like it's going to be a few quarters before operation. But what means to be done before operational start? And then I guess, when do you plan to introduce internally produced biocarbon into your steel production flows? Do you have -- is there -- I mean, is there a need for customer commitments for the products with this biocarbon or you do expect the premium for products coming using that product? Theresa Wagler : That's a good question. I would hope to have a premium, but Barry's laughing at me. So the biocarbon facility, the team is doing a great job. It's still under construction. And again, everything is pointing toward a first quarter 2025 start. We will have that product. It's already been fully tested at each of the steel mills that we'll be receiving it. We don't have enough product to satisfy all of the carbon needs at our steel mills, but a majority of it, so we'll start using that and easing that into the product mix for the steel mills as we enter the first half of next year. As far as whether or not there's premium charged to that product, that's just going to be part of our decarbonization journey. So it's going to be used as a matter of whether -- it's not for a specific customer necessarily. Mark Millett : Yes. Theresa, I would just add on that, that we don\u2019t need customer approvals for this product. It\u2019s so early in the process that the use of what kind of carbon doesn\u2019t factor into what the final steel product will actually how it will perform. And I would think of it as it\u2019s not a binary decision or it\u2019s one or the other. So the path towards introducing this to the mills will really flow based on how the startup goes in the proximity and how the teams respond to it. The trials that have been done have been very successful through the Aymium pilot facility. So we have a good working knowledge going into this. And the melt shop teams are regularly meeting with the biocarbon team. And we\u2019re excited about it. It\u2019s a beautiful plant down in Mississippi. Operator : Your next question is coming from Andrew Jones with UBS. Andrew Jones : Just on the market range environment. I mean we hear the comments we've made on the positive outlook and potential for demand to recover. But just in a more pessimistic, Mark you are aware that doesn't happen, Big River 2 starts to come through. Maybe you don't get the same trade protection that you are hoping for. I mean -- what would you consider doing within your portfolio to kind of do your bit to help to balance the market? I mean, would it change your production plans in any way? Or would you be an active participant in trying to write the market? Or do you see as just a low-cost producer and you can essentially take share and expect others potentially draw out at the higher end of the curve, how do you look at 2025 in that more pessimistic store? Mark Millett : Firstly, we're not pessimistic. We're very, very constructive on the future market in 2025. There are too many things there that will drive that. And our customer base, in general, our customer base is very, very positive for '25. You should have a lower interest rate environment that will kick start nonresidential construction. New Millennium right now, the order book, the order -- the engineering, the whole flow of things is strong. It just needs a slightly lower interest rate environment for those developers to push buttons and move forward. So again, I just want to emphasize, we're constructive on the marketplace. Just in general, and it's not a matter of 2025 or it's just a matter of any market cycle. We will produce to what our customer base requires quite simply. Andrew Jones : Okay. Mark Millett : Sorry, if I can, just -- and I think one has to recognize part of our whole business model, it revolves around just that. We recognize that the markets are cyclical in our business. And so over the years since the very beginning, 30 years ago, we have always focused on a very diversified product mix. That product mix is value add, very diverse across actual products, but also markets. That allows you a huge, huge, huge flexibility as markets ebb and flow. A very, very strong part of our strategy has always also been the pull-through volume. So if you look today, New Millennium, they consume about 600,000 tonnes, I think, what they're about last year, maybe a little bit more of the products that we make. The conversion facilities at Heartland. They've got roughly 800,000 tons of capability. You have the tax, they have about 800,000 tonne capability. So in all, our internal sort of substrate requirements is well over 2 million tonnes. We supply some of that internally, but Barry and his team also procures a lot in the marketplace. So we're actually one of the strangely, and a lot of people don't recognize it, but we're one of the largest buyers sheet products in the U.S. today. That pull-through volume can flex. So if you look at our utilization rates through cycle, those utilization rates are always superior to any of our peers because of the value-add diverse product mix and also the pull-through volume that we have internally. So even if it does come off a little bit, you will see that we retain our strong cash recycle cash generation capability without that. Andrew Jones : Okay. Fair enough. But no major closures of higher cost lines or older lines or any sort of reaction to kind of volumes potentially displacing volumes [indiscernible] else in the portfolio, that's not on the agenda. Mark Millett : I didn\u2019t hear that. Theresa Wagler : That\u2019s okay. You would say no. No. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is coming from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Independent Research. John Tumazos : Looking out a couple of years, which sectors do you think are most fertile for the next big investment. This year, U.S. aluminum demand is trending up 5%. Steel has been down in apparent demand 5 out of 6 years now. Lots of companies have built a lot of steel capacity. Did we expect that aluminum or recycling or some other new area is the candidate for the next big project in 2026 or '27 or '28. Mark Millett : Well, firstly, John, we will always take your questions, sir. The \u2013 as I look across the \u2013 our portfolio, we\u2019re not strong on the recycled markets just in general, where there are regional focused opportunities to vulcanize our supply chains. We certainly will anticipate that or look at that. But I think we have a good recycle sort of platform. You will see us grow here and there to expand our aluminum supply chain. But that\u2019s well, it won\u2019t be meaningful dollars to do that. On the steel side, I think you\u2019re correct. I don\u2019t see the opportunity necessarily for another 3 million tonne a year greenfield site. We\u2019re not \u2013 as you know, we\u2019re not in business just to grow big for the sake of it. We want to differentiate our value chain. We want to always sort of diversify. \u2013 that the team has identified several value-add opportunities, products that we don\u2019t make today. And those are sort of percolating in the background and you\u2019ll see over time us continuing to lever those higher-value products. Aluminum is obviously new to us. We want to walk before we run. Get the first mill up. But there\u2019s no doubt the volume growth in aluminum going forward will be much stronger than steel and gives rise to opportunity there. As you\u2019ve seen strategy in the past in steel, the move downstream again into value-add products in aluminum, capitalize on prepaint expertise. I think you will see that also. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Well, super. Well, for any of our employees and our teams out there that are still on the call, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for what you do. You're an incredible, incredible team doing incredible things. We can't do what we do without a loyal customer base. And again, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your support over the years. We will continue to try and bring value and create value for you. Shareholders that are on the line that own us, thank you. Those investors that don't own us, all I can say is you should. So from SDI and every employee. Thank you for all those that support us. Have a great, great, great day and be safe. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Millett : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us for our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. As you saw, our teams achieved a solid financial and operational performance in 2024 in what was a challenging market environment posting best-in-class financial metrics, which is a certainly a testament to our business model and performance driven culture. The highlights obviously second highest annual steel shipments of 12.7 million tons, cash from operations of $1.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 billion and most importantly, we celebrated our safest year ever. Additionally, we've been ramping up our four new value-added flat rolled steel coating lines with the expectation of full earnings benefit in 2025. These lines represent an additional 1.1 million tons of higher margin product diversification for us. The Sinton team gained considerable momentum in the last two months running above 80% capacity and they are doing even better in January, with expectations to reach profitability in the coming months and Barry will go into more detail in his comments about the progress and what is yet to come. Aluminum Dynamics cast its first aluminum ingot two weeks ago at our Columbus facility and we're extremely proud and excited for the team. Everything is on schedule for a systematic commissioning of the rest of the plant to ensure commercial shipments this June. I could not be more proud of the entire Steel Dynamics team. They are the foundation of our company. There's no doubt that their passion, innovative spirit and commitment drives our success. As I mentioned, certainly the most gratifying achievement was having a record year in terms of safety. Both our recordable injury and lost time rates were the lowest in our history. We continue to build a world-class safety culture and our teams' dedication to our Take Control of Safety program is absolutely extraordinary. The core safety teams visited 85% of our 124 locations in 2024. These teams are made up of our teammates who volunteer to sacrifice time from their families to keep their colleagues safe and they are truly making it happen. 60% of our locations had zero recordable injuries and 81% had zero lost time incidents last year. I'm continually inspired by the commitment of our team members have for one another. They consider themselves family and challenge the status quo each and every day. And even with those phenomenal performance metrics, we certainly have a lot of work to do as we strive toward our zero incident environment goal. With that introduction, Theresa, would you like to give us your thoughts for the fourth quarter and for the year? Theresa Wagler : Thanks Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. As Mark mentioned, 2024 had its challenges, yet the team performed well and I want to recognize that. In 2024 we achieved operating income of $1.9 billion and net income of $1.5 billion or $9.84 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion and liquidity remains strong at $2.2 billion as we continued meaningful organic growth investments and strong shareholder returns and not to be ignored, our three-year after tax return on invested capital was a resilient 23%. As for the fourth quarter of 2024, our net income was $207 million or $1.36 per diluted share with adjusted EBITDA of $372 million. As some of you noted, our effective tax rate benefited the quarter approximately $13 million or 5.4% due to state adjustments and another 3% benefit related to certain reserve items. Fourth quarter 2024 revenues were $3.9 billion and operating income was $238 million lower than sequential third quarter results driven by lower realized steel pricing and seasonal volume. Our steel operations generated operating income of $165 million in the quarter sequentially lower as average pricing declined $48 per ton while scrap pricing remained relatively flat. Seasonally lower shipments declined 5% in the quarter across the steel platform with a 50,000 ton negative impact at our Butler flat roll division related to an unplanned outage. For the full year 2024, operating income from our steel operations was $1.6 billion with near record annual shipments. For your modeling purposes for the quarter, our hot band shipments were 901,000 tons, our cold rolled shipments were 119,000 tons and our coated flat rolled shipments were 1,282,000 tons. Likely many of you noticed a reclassification in our supplemental data. In the fourth quarter, we reclassified the financial impact of certain aluminum operations from our Metals Recycling segment to our new Aluminum segment, impacting the associated revenue and operating income lines in our historical data. For context, for 2024, this would have shifted income of approximately $15 million from our metals recycling unit down to Aluminum operations. For the fourth quarter, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $23 million as nonferrous metals spreads improved more than offsetting lower seasonal shipments. For the full year of 2024, operating income from our metals recycling operations was $77 million, higher than prior year results as volume and metal spread improved across the platform. We're the largest North American metals recycler processing and consuming ferrous scrap and nonferrous aluminum, copper and other materials, and we are growing in support of our increased steel capacity and soon to be aluminum flat rolled operations through new and expanded supplier relationships and through the use of innovative new separation technologies. I'm really proud of what the mills recycling team is doing. As it relates to steel fabrication, our steel fabrication team achieved fourth quarter operating income of $142 million lower than sequential third quarter results as realized pricing declined a modest 4% and shipments seasonally decreased. For the full year 2024, earnings from the platform were $667 million representing a very good year. Our steel joist and deck demand remained solid with good order activity and Barry will expound more on that in a minute. We believe that the Infrastructure Inflation Reduction Act, manufacturing growth and onshoring will still increase and support fixed asset investment and related flat and long product steel and steel joist and deck consumption in the coming year. Heading to our aluminum operations, a quick reminder as we finish constructing the aluminum facilities, non capitalizable expenses are required to flow through SG&A until startup. As a result, our SG&A was higher in 2024 by approximately $88 million. We continue to have expectations to be EBITDA positive in the second half of 2025 for this platform and plan to operate the rolling mill at approximately 50% in 2025 and 75% in 2026. The construction and commissioning of the rolling mill and the San Luis Potosi Recycled Slab Center are progressing extremely well. Approximately $2.2 billion has already been invested through December 2024 with expectations of funding the remaining $500 million plus in 2025. During the fourth quarter of 2024 we generated cash flow from operations of $347 million. For the full year we achieved annual cash flow of $1.8 billion. Working capital in the fourth quarter grew with the improved performance at Sinton and preparation for startup at our aluminum facilities, which represented an increase generally of around $100 million. In addition to some unexpected increases we had in WIP and finished goods at some of our long product divisions, which we expect to be right-sized shortly. Our cash generation is consistently strong based on a differentiated circular business model and highly variable low cost structure. At the end of the year we had liquidity of $2.2 billion comprised of cash and investments of approximately $1 billion and a fully available unsecured revolver of $1.2 billion. During 2024, we invested $1.9 billion in capital investments of which approximately 70% relayed to construction of our aluminum flat rolled investments. Approximately $200 million of funding for the aluminum investment shifted from the fourth quarter to 2025 spending, as did some other smaller projects throughout the company, increasing our full-year capital investments estimate from the original $750 million to $800 million to closer to $1 billion at this point. Again, this is simply a timing shift. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $295 million of our common stock and $1.2 billion for the year, representing 6% of our outstanding shares. At December 31, we had $194 million remaining authorized for repurchase. These actions reflect the strength of our capital foundation and consistently strong cash flow generation capability and the continued optimism and confidence in our future. Our capital allocation strategy prioritizes high return growth with shareholder distributions comprised of a base positive dividend profile that's complemented with a variable share repurchase program, while we remain dedicated to preserving our investment grade credit ratings. Our track record is proven achieving a three-year after tax return on invested capital of 23% as I mentioned, during a period of transformational growth and strong shareholder returns. Our free cash flow profile has fundamentally changed over the last five years. Our annual average free cash flow used to be around $540 million. Today in the last five years it's closer to $3 billion. We've placed ourselves in a position of strength to have sustainable capital foundation that provides the opportunity for meaningful strategic growth and strong shareholder returns, while maintaining investment grade metrics. We're squarely positioned for the continuation of sustainable, optimized long-term value creation. On the sustainability front, as we mentioned on the third quarter call in 2024, we did announce new certified science based greenhouse gas emissions intensity targets for our steel mills. They are in alignment with 1.5 degree set forth in the Paris Agreement. We have interim 2030 emissions intensity goals as well as 2050 goals and we feel very strongly that we can accomplish this. Decarbonization is a meaningful part of our long-term value creation strategy and we're dedicated to our people, our communities and our environment. We uniquely have an actionable path forward that's more manageable and we believe considerably less expensive than we ever had for many of our industry peers. Our carbon reduction strategy is an ongoing journey and we're moving forward with the intention to make a positive difference. And uniquely, actually, Tricia just let me know last night, we received an award from the Corporate, is that right, Tricia? The Corporate Knights and we're one of the world's most sustainable companies. In fact, we're 29th out of 100 companies and we're the only steel company that was mentioned, so I think that's pretty good and I want to give a congratulations to the teams because we can't do it without them. So with that, Barry? Barry Schneider : Thank you, Theresa. Our steel fabrication operations performed well throughout 2024, achieving historically strong earnings. At the end of the year, our steel joist and deck order backlog was solid, extending through the first half of 2025. We continue to have high expectations for the business due to the positive customer sentiment, high quoting activity, a moderating interest rate environment, continued manufacturing onshoring and public funding for infrastructure and other fixed asset investment programs. The uplift from this macro environment could be considerable for this platform as well as for our steel operations. Our steel fabrication platform provides meaningful volume support for our steel mills, critical in softer demand environments, allowing for higher through cycle steel utilization compared to our peers. It also helps mitigate the financial risk of lower steel prices. Our metals recycling operation also performed very well this year considering the challenge of declining scrap prices through most of 2024. The North American geographic footprint of our metals recycling platform provides a strategic competitive advantage for our steel mills and for our scrap generating customers. In particular, our Mexican locations competitively advantage our Columbus and Sinton raw material positions. They also strategically support aluminum scrap procurement for our flat rolled aluminum investments. Our metals recycling team is also partnering even more closely with both our steel and aluminum teams to expand scrap separation capabilities through both process and technology solutions. This will help mitigate potential prime ferrous scrap supply issues in the future. It will also provide us with a significant advantage to materially increase the recycled content for our aluminum flat rolled products and increase our earnings opportunities. Ferrous scrap prices have stabilized and have increased in January. We expect prices to be moderately high in February as well based on the extreme cold weather through much of the United States and resulting diminished scrap flows. The steel team had another strong year. During 2024 the domestic steel industry operated at an estimated production utilization rate of 77% while our steel mills operated a rate of 86% excluding Sinton. We consistently operate at higher utilization to our value-added steel product diversification, our differentiated customer supply chain solutions and the support for our internal manufacturing businesses. This higher through cycle utilization of our steel mills is a key competitive advantage supporting our strong and growing cash generation capability and the best-in-class financial metrics. Regarding the flat rolled steel markets, pricing stabilized in the fourth quarter and into January. Flat rolled customer order entry has been seasonally strong to begin 2025. Lead times remain steady and customers remain optimistic on the outlook. Inventories remain historically lean, but increased imports have kept incremental buying at bay in certain product areas, specifically for coated flat roll steel products. As most of you know, we levied a trade case late in 2024 and expect to get favorable countervailing and dumping rulings sometime in the next few months, which should significantly decrease these unfairly priced imports. Long product steel markets were challenged in the fourth quarter with seasonal weakness across the platform based on customer feedback. The severe weather definitely had an impact as well as cautiousness related to the election outcome and possible administrative moves. We have already seen order activity improvement and expect 2025 to pick up nicely in consumption as we progress through the first half of the year. Based on our railroad rail customers' discussions and project activity, we believe we will see increased demand for rail products in 2025 which will further help our product diversification in our long products group. Our Sinton, Texas flat rolled steel mills production reliability improved dramatically beginning in November, exiting the year with the utilization rate over 80%. The team continues to improve with operation levels approaching 90% levels in the last four weeks. The team continues working through quality and yield issues that are keeping costs at elevated levels. However, we expect these costs to moderate as we progress through the first half of the year, reaching positive earnings soon. We continue to work on product development with Sinton's capabilities to expand our flat rolled product offering. Also, the additional two new value-added coating lines are up and running, improving Sinton's operating efficiencies, value-added product mix and through cycle capabilities. Regarding the steel market environment, North American automotive production estimates for 2025 were recently revised slightly lower; however, they remain at historically normal levels. Automotive dealer inventories continue to remain below historical norms and actually have declined further in December. The auto fleet in the United States continues to age and has now reached a record high. Our specific automotive customer base has remained strong and our participation with this base has remained steady and in some cases growing. This is for both flat rolled products and our automotive SBQ customers. Nonresidential construction remained stable with slowdowns across some industries; however, we believe moderating interest rates will unlock pent up project work and create new opportunities as we progress into 2025. Additionally, onshoring and infrastructure spending should provide further support to fixed asset investment in related construction oriented projects. As for the energy market, the solar industry continues to grow and be a meaningful market for both our flat rolled and long products mills. Oil and gas activity remained steady with recent signs of increased activity for both flat rolled products and SBQ products. Looking forward, we are optimistic regarding steel demand and pricing dynamics as we enter 2025. With that, I'll turn that over. Mark Millett : Super. Thank you, Barry. Thank you, Theresa. So I believe it's more than evident that our performance-driven team-based culture in combination with a proven diversified and value-add business model, drive superior through cycle financial metrics. This consistently strong operating and financial performance continues to support our cash generation and growth investment strategies, allowing a very balanced cash allocation strategy that has delivered the highest shareholder returns in our industry. Our disciplined investment approach continues to support a strong and growing through cycle cash generation profile, while maintaining the highest return on invested capital of our peers. As mentioned, the four value-added flat rolled steel coating lines are increasing volume and performing very well from a quality perspective. These types of high return investments are key to our value-added product and supply chain differentiation strategies. As we mentioned, Sinton continues to improve its operational reliability with expectations for strong production and financial contribution in 2025. And most recently, our aluminum growth strategy is unfolding and is especially compelling. The ADI [ph] investment premise parallels our disruptive entry into the steel industry some 30 years ago. Back then the market environment was similar to the domestic aluminum environment today; older assets, high legacy costs, inefficient high cost operations. They had difficulty earning their cost of capital over the years. Hence there's been little additional investment in facilities and technology. They have somewhat of an arrogant customer approach and but unlike our entry into the oversupplied steel market, there was a significant North American supply deficit for aluminum sheet and it will continue to grow. There's a clear business alignment where we can leverage SDI's core competencies. Our construction knowhow is quite persuasive. All you have to do is look at the rate of construction of this project and it's absolutely remarkable. And we also have operational knowhow and our performance-driven culture will drive higher efficiency and lower cost operations than our peers. The project also levers OmniSource's recycling footprint. They're the largest North American aluminum scrap recycler and they have done a great job here of late developing new separation technologies to separate the various aluminum grades from the scrap stream, particularly the 5000 and 6000 series from automotive process scrap. This is a meaningful investment. It's cost effective and a high return, growth and diversification opportunity. The project is no longer just a vision, but quickly becoming a reality. And as I said, just look at the website. We update that I think on almost a monthly basis. And just to think that we started digging in the ground July 5th of the year before last, somewhat 18 months ago is absolutely incredible the progress to date. Construction of the expansive mill in Columbus, Mississippi as I said is at an extraordinary pace. SLP, our slab and cast house down there is also proceeding incredibly well and should be operational here in March or April. The future customer base across all sectors is excited to have a new market entrant that is known to be innovative, customer centric and responsive to their needs. And I have to emphasize, after I talked to a bunch of the customers out there, aluminum customers out there, we will be innovative. We will be incredibly responsive and provide best-in-class service which will translate directly into customer value. We will be a differentiated supplier. Conversations with existing and new customers across the markets remain robust as they need and desire new supply options. As we strategically initiated at Sinton, we're developing an onsite industrial park to locate aluminum processing and consuming facilities there. We've already announced one such relationship with Klockner. It will help service our automotive customers. And we are currently negotiating a second arrangement that will result in approximately 100,000 metric tons of annual onsite processing capability. As our aluminum growth has become a visible reality and our reputation permeates the industry, we found aluminum professionals have been signing up to join this exciting project. They're helping us build a phenomenal team that combines in-depth knowledge of aluminum flat roll operations, aluminum commercial markets and process technology along with customer service, which complements our SDI professionals that will bring our performance-driven culture to bear. As we stated in the past, just to recap the facility itself, it's a state-of-the-art plant, 650,000 metric tons of flat roll capacity Columbus, Mississippi. The mix will be around 300,000 metric tons of canned stock, 230,000 metric tons of automotive material and about 130,000 tons of industrial and construction products. Actually at Columbus onsite mill cast slab capacity will be 600,000 metric tons supported by two satellite recycled aluminum slab casting centers located in UBC's scrap rich regions. The project scope includes additional scrap processing and segregation technologies as I've already mentioned, to maximize aluminum recycled content. Our aluminum team is executing exceptionally well. The team successfully cast their first industrial and beverage can ingots on CAS complex #1 in Columbus the this past January 12th and we've had six or seven casts since in developing process variables for the different grades. We plan to continue commissioning throughout the facility during the coming months as we produce commercially viable products before midyear 2025. Production is expected to grow to a 50% annual run rate by the end of 2025 and 75% capacity in 2026. Given current market conditions we also expect to be a little EBITDA positive before year end 2025. We expect through cycle annual EBITDA of around $650 million to $700 million plus about $40 million to $50 million for the metals recycling platform. The most significant savings relative to our competition center on four key areas; labor savings, higher recycled content, significant process yield improvements and logistics. It can hardly be explained, but the excitement within our company is palpable, especially within the Mississippi and San Luis Potosi aluminum sites and it grows as our teams recognize our ability to revolutionize the North American aluminum industry as we did in steel. We are impassioned by our current and future growth plans as they will continue to drive the high return growth momentum we have consistently demonstrated over the years. The earnings growth of these new projects is compelling. The capital spending for Sinton, the four value-add lines and Aluminum Dynamics is largely spent with projected future through cycle EBITDA contribution of over $1.4 billion. Steel Dynamics has grown to an incredibly resilient cash generating business of scale and diversification driven by the best teams in the world. In the last five years we've invested billions of dollars in our organic strategic growth. We've earned a return on invested capital of 24% compared to the S&P 500 at only 12% and way higher than the best of our steel peers. We've increased our cash dividend over 90%. We repurchased over 30% of our outstanding shares, all while maintaining best-in-class investment grades, credit metrics and creating outstanding value for our customers and suppliers, our teams and our shareholders. I'm excited as investors recognize the power and consistency of our through cycle cash generation combined with our consistent and high return capital allocation strategy and they value us accordingly, more like industrial companies. It is our belief that the steel industry has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years that will amplify this position. There's a pervasive sense of mercantilism that will provide a level playing field through continued and appropriate trade mechanisms. Risk mitigation to address numerous supply chain dislocations is accelerated re-shoring of manufacturing. AI and cloud computing will support nonresidential construction, data centers, chip factories, battery plants and the like along with growing fixed asset investment associated with public dollars. And lastly, decarbonization will materially steepen the global cost curve, providing Steel Dynamics with a huge competitive advantage to gain market share and increase metal spreads, given our position of some of our sheet metals of the lowest carbon footprint in the world. This evolving metals business environment will amplify our earnings capability going forward. We are blessed with good fortune. Our people are our foundation and I thank each of them for their passion and dedication. We are committed to them and I remind those listening today that safety for yourselves, your families and each other is the highest priority. I would be remiss not to thank our loyal customers, many whom supported us since our inception some 31 years ago. These partnerships are based on trust, on doing what we say we will do, creating new solutions to enhance their value proposition. Our new aluminum partners will experience the same and also our suppliers and service providers who we value and trust, thank you. Our culture and business model continue to differentiate our performance leading to best-in-class financial metrics. We're a circular metals business, providing enhanced lower carbon supply chain solutions, in turn mitigating volatility and cash flow generation through all market cycles, providing enhanced shareholder returns and value to all participants. So we look forward to creating new opportunities for all of us today and in the years ahead. And with that said, Matthew, could we turn it over to questions please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Tristan Gresser from BNP Paribas. Your line is live. Tristan Gresser : Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, I was wondering, have you witnessed any weather impact either on your operations so far this year or on demand dynamics? And also what type of volume increase should we expect in steel and fabrication Q1? I'll start there. Barry Schneider : Tristan, this is Barry Schneider. With regard to the weather, it does definitely tighten up scrap, just the availability to move it. I know there are lot of discussions out there about energy and what's going on in the various regional transmission areas. To date we haven't been significantly impacted. We have a really good relationship with both our utilities and our communities. So if there are emergencies, we have the ability to taper our usage. But it's been minimal to this point and we continue just to work with the cold weather as everybody else does. A lot of our teams work outside and could you repeat the second question, please? Tristan Gresser : Yes. If you can share a bit of color on the guidance for volumes, what should we expect for your steel business and your fabrication business sequentially into Q1? Theresa Wagler : So Tristan, as you know, we give limited guidance as it relates to things like that. But as you look at the first quarter, definitely and you look at some of the disruptions we had in the fourth quarter because as Barry mentioned, there was some weather impact with shipping as well with some of our steel divisions, but we would expect seasonally to see higher volumes in the first quarter. I think more importantly, like looking beyond just a quarter, but looking toward 2025, as all three of us mentioned in our opening remarks, the customers and our teams are really looking to see increased consumption and volume across the platforms in 2025 as it relates to some of the public funding. But I think more importantly as it relates to maybe some additional benefit from reduced imports from what we think will be a pretty robust construction environment, specifically in the second half of the year and then potentially some things from the administration as well. So we're more focused on the longer term than just quarter-over-quarter. Tristan Gresser : Okay. No, that's fair. And maybe just another question on the hot dip galvanized trade case. Can you explain why the investigation was asked to be delayed? Is that because there were signs that the tariffs may not be applied in full? And also regarding the import situation, obviously there's a lot of chatter around potential tariffs. Have you witnessed some import bounce in recent weeks or before those potential tariffs take place? Mark Millett : As regarding the timing, that is pretty typically just a procedural type event that happens with trade cases. There's an incredible amount of data that has to be collected and then the government agencies have to have to pore through that data. There are 10 different countries that where cases were filed against and we have seen an import bump and in some cases just being able to store any more material limits what could come in. But we have seen it, we see it subsidizing right now. And regardless of what new trade actions that may happen with the administration, these cases are traditional cases that are based on regular commerce between countries. So we're expecting very favorable rulings and we do anticipate taking this unnecessary noise out of the marketplace. As the rest of the world has struggled in certain areas with slowdowns, America becomes the place where these tons make their way. So again, normal cases, they're going to process through the system like they always would and then whatever the administration does going forward, obviously we'll react to and work with that. Tristan Gresser : All right, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Timna Tanners : Good morning and thanks for the detail. I wanted to really understand better the situation at Sinton and the finishing lines. So in the Q4 results you talked about Sinton at 80%. So it looks like great progress there, but I'm not understanding why that's not more profitable at that utilization? And similar question for the finishing lines, like what does it take to get to greater profitability, when should we see that switch over and what could the contribution look like? Thanks a lot. Barry Schneider : Timna, this is Barry. It's interesting when we talk about the progress of Sinton. I remain incredibly excited about what that team is doing. And the throughput is a very large part of any cost compression any operations in steel mills. So the gains we've seen on the hot side have really been excellent. And it's really a function of our teams are really working well together and our culture is being realized. The mentoring that our other steel professionals, the men and women at all our other steel plants have been going down there working with the Sinton team. And what started early as basic education on equipment is now mentoring. And the decision making they make every day drives the decisions to the floor and empowers the team to really make good decisions and find their best practices. Machine reliability improvements also. So as throughput is increased, that definitely gives us a great opportunity. Extraordinary cost right now are really a matter of a big part of the financial impact and that extraordinary costs are related to the reliability of the machine as well as improving the maintenance and the redundancies that our equipment needs. So as we've figured out where the weaknesses are, we're putting money, expensive money to put systems in place and people in place to make sure that the money we're spending today reduces the money we need to spend in the future. These costs also have a direct impact on the quality. And probably the single, to go specifically at your point about productivity, productivity alone is great, but what we have to really do is drive yields and prime rates. It's expensive commissioning, particularly downstream units because the products that are going to those lines as they start up have a lot more value in them. So we continue to drive more of our tons that we make, leaving the plant on a prime order of high value that drives the mixed average selling price up. So right now in the past month it's sitting the hot side is operating at a prime rate that is actually exceeding our Butler and Columbus plants. Butler and Columbus are world-class when it comes to turning every piece of raw material coming into our plant into a prime shipment. We're also very focused on product development. So instead of just having one product line, we continue to try to cost effectively and conscientiously develop products that will help the productivity and the product offering that we have out of out of Sinton. So the customer is not going to compromise their needs. So as we commission the lines as we go through the acceptability and the new customer qualification processes with these new lines, that does have a cost. So we're really excited with where we're at on the curve. It was ambitious, but the addition of the two new lines at Sinton, have allowed the mill to be more efficient. So as we work through these commissioning efforts and these approval processes, more of the product leaves the plant at high selling values. So that's a lot of what the Sinton cost is behind the productivity improvements. Mark Millett : And I would say Timna, that one should focus on the step function improvement these past three months for them to be hitting 80% and I think, you know, all last year we said that mill would be operating at that rate by year end and so accomplish that. More recently they've been operating in excess of 90%. They're getting 10,000 ton days, they're getting 35, 36 string heats on the caster. The performance there has literally shot up exponentially and the fact that it didn't make money in the fourth quarter is not atypical. We're ramping up and the profitability as Barry well-articulated follows and our expectation is that profitability will be gained in the second quarter. Theresa Wagler : Just one thing to follow. I want to level set everyone. So Barry and Mark mentioned that even though it's been a couple of years in, it's still in that startup mode where once it gets to a fully mature facility which will be later this year, it would be just like all of our other facilities. So as a reminder, our structural and rail division operated at less than 30% of its capacity in that 2009 great recession environment. And they were not just cash flow positive, but they were operationally positive from an earnings perspective as well. So Tynton will get there and the teams will achieve that here in the first half of the year. Timna Tanners : Okay, thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Lawson Winder from Bank of America. Your line is live. Once again, Lawson, your line is live. Lawson Winder : Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, Mark, Theresa and Barry. Can I just ask on capital allocation priorities? So, I mean it's a very nice setup for Steel Dynamics heading into 2025 with a pretty material free cash flow inflection expected here. Are there any new projects in the pipeline that could possibly be green lit in 2025? And then on the other side of potential growth options, what is Steel Dynamics appetite to potentially acquire new capacity? Thank you. Mark Millett : Sorry, what was the second half of that question? Oh M&A\u2026Obviously we have allocated a lot of cash to phenomenal growth at Sinton the four new lines and aluminum and they are being realized. There is no, I would say imminent large scale organic growth anticipated right now. We have several projects, but our focus currently is to execute, execute, execute, get Sinton up and running incredibly well from a profitability standpoint. Get Aluminum Dynamics up and running and it's going to be a fabulous, fabulous mill, fabulous investment and return for us. So that's our immediate, I guess, focus for the team. On the M&A front, again we continue to look at opportunities as they come in and if one were to make sense then maybe we would look at it, but nothing imminent right this second. Lawson Winder : Then would it be fair to conclude in absence of an obvious new growth project, and nothing obvious I guess for M&A, could capital return accelerate then just given the setup for 2025? Theresa Wagler : So Lawson, we are absolutely a growth oriented company and we're very committed to our investment grade metrics and that being said, we've had because of the business model that we have, that consistent cash flow generation allows us to really have meaningful shareholder returns. So I think you've seen that in the last three, four, five years and I don't see anything changing that, absent something that's unforeseen at this point in time. So we'll be focused to Mark and Barry's point on execution first and foremost, but then you will continue to see us look to avail ourselves of what we think is an attractively priced company by buying our own shares back and by keeping that positive dividend profile. Lawson Winder : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alexander Hacking from Citi. Your line is live. Alexander Hacking : Yes, hi, Theresa. Can you just clarify the expectations for the aluminum mill in terms of production? I think you said 50% this year, 75% next year. Is that sort of exit rate or is that average? I guess, put another way, like, how many tons would you expect to ship this year and next year? Thanks. Barry Schneider : The 50% for 2025 is ending the year at a 50% utilization rate, 75% for 2026 is total capability. Alexander Hacking : Okay, thank you. And then just to follow up, if I might, on the fab segment, you know, margins were very stable there last year, actually, you know, around 37% to 40% EBITDA margin, if my math is correct. I mean, is it too early to call that a new normal? It's obviously a lot higher than it was pre-COVID and lower than the kind of peak COVID years, but surprising amount of stability there. Any comments would be helpful, thank you. Theresa Wagler : So you know Alex, as we talked about it in the past, we do believe that that whole industry went through a commercial change as it relates to pricing and what that means. And what I mean by that is that there was a product and a service that was probably not, probably was underpriced pre-COVID and there wasn't a recognition of the engineering and the value add that's a part of that. So yes, we right now if you look at 2024, those volumes were actually pretty low even for pre-COVID. And we would expect to see that change in 2025 and in the out years as we start to see what we believe is an environment that will support increased fixed asset investment which will therefore absolutely support increased steel consumption, steel joists and deck consumption and therefore, you know, more scrap required in the U.S. as well. So we see this as a pretty stabilized period of time with margins that are going to be higher on a go forward basis and on a mid-cycle basis. Alexander Hacking : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Bill Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is live. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, this is Bennett on for Bill. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to get your thoughts on recent tightness in UBC scrap spreads and whether this could be a structural trend with greater demand from two new rolling mills ramping and China recently removing scrap import controls. And if you could also remind us what the expected scrap intensity will be across the three product groups out of ADI. Mark Millett : Well, we don't anticipate this being a new norm. Aluminum scrap, steel scrap, they're incredibly efficient, effective markets. There is I think some emotion out there as we're getting into the market and people are doing some strange things, but I think it will normalize over time. The scrap across the -- individually I would say we're looking at for can stock at around 95% utilization, recycle content and when you get to the automotive grades, probably if I remember correctly, around 60%, 65%. Again we are absolutely focused on being best-in-class there. We do have OmniSource, the largest aluminum recycler in North America today. They've come up with some phenomenal sorting segregation capabilities just as we have over the years for steel scrap and the shredded obsolete flow. They're achieving the same capabilities in aluminum. So there's absolutely no doubt we will be best-in-class there going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for that detail. And as we think about losses moving forward, I think in the past, it was guided to around $25 million a quarter. You were a bit above that in the fourth quarter. Is that still a good guidepost or could we see them continue to move higher? Thank you. Theresa Wagler : As it relates to that, as we ramp up in the first half of the year, you will see some incremental increase. I think for the first quarter, it's still going to likely be in that $30 million to $35 million dollars range, but as they start to operate, you will see additional expenses come through until it's offset with sales, which Mark mentioned earlier should start in the June time frame. So, a little bit of incremental increase first half of the year before we start to see the offsets from operations. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Tumazos from Very Independent Research. Your line is live. John Tumazos : Thank you. Could you give us some color contrasting the lightning blitzkrieg startup for the aluminum versus Sinton, where we're in the fourth year who were the equipment suppliers primarily for aluminum versus for Sinton? Are there issues at Sinton that the product mix is different than anticipated, narrower coils or more batchy or tougher to procure scrap or if there's nonprime steel, is it because of dirty scrap or the melt shop not getting the chemistry right or the rolling practice? It's just such a contrast. Aluminum is ahead of schedule and we are where we are in Sinton. Mark Millett : Well John, great to hear from you. Thanks for supporting us and being on the call as you always are. I think the two projects are very, very different from a startup ramp up utilization perspective. I guess if you look at Sinton, that was essentially a new technology on the caster, that is generation. I don't know whether we call it generation three, four or five or whatever it is, but that is absolutely at the forefront of any technology for that sort of mill in the world. People are coming to us. In all honesty, they're wanting to replicate it in Europe and in Asia. With that new technology comes risk and issues and challenges. And given that, as you know, a CSP plant is a continual process from the very beginning, metal refining, casting, hot strip mill, any bug, any maintenance issue, any shutdown issue shuts the whole mill down. You compare and contrast that with the aluminum mill. The aluminum mill, it's state-of-the-art technology, but there's nothing new there, certainly way, way, way ahead of any technology in the US for sure. But in Asia, in China, these mills, the equipment, the SMS equipment has been supplied quite, quite broadly. So we're not sort of revolutionizing it or pioneering a new technology. The design of the plant, the layout of the plant is a lot more effective and efficient for sure. And there's a lot more batch nature to it. So for instance on the melting and casting side of it we have four units in Columbus. We have a fifth unit in San Luis Potosi and we have a sixth unit out on the West Coast. So again, you lose one, you have a problem with another that's not going to impact the startup for the next two years even if you're missing a couple of those units. So it is a definitely a different beast and we do expect that startup to be quite rapid. Barry Schneider : John, if I could add the quality coming out of Sinton, we're actually quite pleased. We made this technology decision because of where we see the products being needed in the United States. So we've been very happy with high strength products. That product development is going very well. And not to get too specific, but high strength steels of various widths are under demand because that allows you to lighten the weight of things. We're also seeing really good response on the melting side. The steel making at that plant is very good. But as Mark spoke, when you have a continuous process, if you have an issue anywhere amongst the main hot side units, the whole side shuts down. So as the team gets better at making good decisions and operating with confidence, that's where we've seen these incredible gains. That's what the rest of our steelmaking team goes down there to support. It's mentoring. They know what they're doing. They're just making better and better decisions. But we're very happy with the quality. We're happy with should we see a boom in pipe and tube, we're developing those products because we have to be able to service all those markets. So we're excited about where we're at. We're excited with how the technology performs and it's been a rocky road. But at the same time, sometimes when you're first, you have these experiences. But we continue to put more and more capabilities in the mill so our sales team can go to the marketplace with those. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Timna Tanners from Wolfe Research. Your line is live. Timna Tanners : Hey, I had a follow up, if I could. I just wanted to look at your balance sheet. I know at the year ago at this time, you said that you were planning to keep buybacks steady year-over-year and you did that. You know your cash and short-term investment position as far as I could see was the lowest in a decade. Is that an appropriate level and do you think that you would keep buyback steady from recent years levels? Thanks a lot. Theresa Wagler : Well, I'm not sure it's the lowest in a decade, but I've been here too long. I've been here like 26 years. That being said, we feel very comfortable with the capital structure and the capital foundation. We do have another tranche of notes that are maturing here in the second quarter, so we'll be looking to refinance those. But yes Timna, we still plan on having a very active share repurchase program along with the complementary dividend increasing profile simply because as we start to see again the fruition Mark mentioned in his opening comments, we've in the last three years spent or last five years spent money for organic growth. Now we're going to start seeing the benefit from a cash stream perspective and an earnings stream perspective in 2025 and that will be a great resource for us to continue to again as I mentioned buy back company that we think is pretty well run at a pretty significant discount. So we don't see anything like that. We don't see anything changing from this point forward. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Millett for any closing remarks. Mark Millett : Well again thank you everyone for joining us. And I guess as I reflect we on these calls tend to get driven into sort of near-term detail. But just to acknowledge those that our shareholders and those analysts that have literally started looking at us as a metals business and more of a perhaps an industrial type valuation. If you just look at our total shareholder return over the years, I mean you can't argue against it. I mean whether it's a one year or three year, five year, 10-year, I think the team has done an incredible job following through on what we've always said and that's a long-term value. We don't look at just building the company for the next six months. When you have a 10-year total shareholder return of 813% which is three, almost four times our best steel peer, and even the S&P 500 index at 255%. I mean we blow those statistics away and it's because of the of the business model the team has built over the last 15 or 20 years, essentially the foundation of the company. And so I would just thank those that recognize that and continue to support us. And then finally, again, to every single employee teammate out there, thank you for what you do. You're incredible. Be safe. Thank you. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation and have a great and safe day.",
