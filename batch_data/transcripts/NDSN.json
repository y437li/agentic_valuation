At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Nicole, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, February 26, 2014 on Nordson's first quarter results. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until March 5, by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 63062969. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our first quarter 2014 results, and some comments about our 2014 second quarter outlook. Please go ahead, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. And thank you for attending Nordson's first quarter 2014 conference call. Nordson's first quarter results reflect our normal seasonality, lower demand and selected technology end markets and regional variations in the pace of macroeconomic growth. We're encouraged by the solid organic growth in the quarter in our consumer non-durable end markets which make up the largest portion of our revenues. Those results set by softness related primarily to select applications in our electronics end markets. On a geographic basis, conditions remained mixed with organic volume growth during the quarter in the U.S., Americas, and Europe being offset by softness in Japan and Asia Pacific. We've begun and will continue to make near-term adjustments to spending as prudent in this mixed environment. Quite frankly, our top line performance in recent quarters has been below our long-term expectations. At the same time, our global team is strongly positioned to capture demand when and where it occurs. And we remain optimistic about our prospects over the next several quarters. In a few moments, I'll share additional comments about those prospects, current business trends and our near-term outlook. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide more detailed commentary on our first quarter financial results as well as some comments on our guidance for the second quarter of 2014. Greg? Greg Thaxton : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sales in the quarter were $359 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year first quarter. Overall, the sales improvement included a 6% increase related to the first-year effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition a 1% decrease in organic volume, and a negative 1% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation primarily related to the devaluation of the Japanese yen. Looking at the sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing delivered a relatively strong quarter where overall sales volume increased 4% on an organic basis and 16% due to the first-year effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition as compared to the prior year first quarter. The organic growth was broad-based across most product lines. On a geographic basis, we generated organic growth in all regions except Japan in this segment where this region was impacted by the timing of nonwoven system sales. Overall, we are pleased with the growth rates in the segment. Given the generally soft macroeconomic backdrop and particularly pleased with the return of solid growth in standard systems supporting the rigid packaging needs of consumer non-durable end markets across most, all regions. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment decreased 10% in the quarter from the prior-year first quarter. Growth was solid for fluid management components serving medical and general industrial end markets and for test and inspection equipment in electronics end markets. This growth was offset by softness in automated dispensing systems for mobile device and other niche electronic end markets. Going into the quarter, we had fairly strong order growth rates as compared to the prior year. However, during the quarter, the pace of orders for some product lines slowed, which impacted the quarter sales. Michael has more to say about the mobile device end markets and the impact on our business. The softness in mobile demand impacted performance in most all regions within this segment where we otherwise experienced growth in other product lines. Within the Industrial Coating segment, sales volume in the current quarter decreased 3% compared to the prior-year first quarter, a period in which this segment delivered organic growth of 38% over the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Growth in powder and liquid coating product lines for durable goods and markets was offset by softness in other product lines. Organic volume growth in the U.S., in the Americas was offset by softness in other geographies. Gross margin in the first quarter was 54% or 55% excluding a non-recurring charge of approximately $2.3 million related to the short-term purchase accounting associated with a step up in the value of inventory acquired in the Kreyenborg acquisition. As compared to the prior year, gross margin was impacted most in the quarter by the dilutive effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition. Unfavorable absorption due to lower organic volume also impacted total company gross margin. Moving down the income statement, operating profit was $54 million and operating margin was 15% in the first quarter, or 16% excluding the non-recurring charge related to acquired inventory. Negative leverage due to lower sales in Advanced Technology had the biggest unfavorable impact on total company operating margin compared to the prior year. As a reminder, our first-quarter margin is typically our lowest given the seasonality of our business. Sales growth in future quarters should provide considerable leverage on operating margin. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 23% in the quarter, or 24% excluding the short-term purchase accounting charges noted previously. Excluding the entire impact of the Kreyenborg acquisition on the quarter, this segment's operating margin improved over the prior year's 24% operating margin with strong incremental margin on the growth and the legacy business. Within the Advanced Technology segment, operating margin for the first quarter was 11%, reflecting the impact of lower volume as compared to the prior year's first quarter. We expect to leverage sequential sales volume growth to generate improved operating margin performance as the year progresses. However, we will continue to manage spending to match the pace of the business. In the Industrial Coating segment, operating margin was 9% in the quarter, also reflective of the lower volume as compared to the prior year's first quarter. This operating margin performance is within our range of expectations for this segment given the quarter's level of revenue and product mix, and we do expect sequential growth in sales along with a leveraged impact on operating margin in the future quarters of fiscal 2014. Continuing down the income statement, reported net income for the quarter was $35 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.54. As in previous quarters, we have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule on our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain items. The current quarter's earnings per share include a $0.02 charge for short-term purchase accounting related to the step-up in the value of the inventory acquired from the Kreyenborg acquisition. The current quarter's EBITDA was $68 million. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter increased 20% over the same period a year ago to $48 million. First quarter free cash flow before dividends was $40 million, 114% of net income, again, representing strong cash conversion. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. We continued our disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter where we return value directly to shareholders through dividends and our share repurchase program totaling $14 million. We had approximately $194 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization at the end of the first quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very liquid with net debt at 1.6x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter, and we have approximately $310 million available from cash and our current revolving credit facility. Before moving on to our second quarter outlook, let me provide some comments on recent order trends. As we typically do, we've provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with the Kreyenborg acquisition included in both years. Looking at orders for the 12 weeks ending February 16, 2014, they are down 4% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, orders over the last 12 weeks increased 5% compared to the same period in the prior year. Order rates increased in all product lines except those serving general products assembly markets and in all regions except Asia Pacific. As noted with our sales growth in the first quarter, we are pleased with this segment's order growth, particularly in light of some market dynamics and macroeconomic trends we've commented on previously. In the Advanced Technology segment, orders over the latest 12 weeks are down 13% compared to the same period in the prior year, most notably in the automated dispense systems associated with mobile and other electronic end markets. Orders for test and inspection systems, surface treatment systems and those product lines serving medical applications were notably strong in the quarter. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week orders are down 17% as compared to the prior year. A large portion of the orders within this segment tend to be larger dollar orders causing swings in order patterns, and these orders tend to have longer lead times. With that, our current forecast does include sequential growth in sales for this segment. These order rates reflect the varying pace of activity we are seeing by end market and region. Strength in consumer non-durable end markets such as packaging and disposable hygiene, flexible packaging and other polymer processing end markets, tests and inspection and medical end markets is being offset by softness in consumer durable and selected electronics end markets. Regionally, Asia Pacific continues to show the most near term softness, but our long-term view for this area continues to be positive. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was up 23% compared to end of the first quarter a year ago. The increase was inclusive of 4% organic growth, and 19% growth due to the Kreyenborg acquisition. Current backlog increased 5% compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. We are forecasting sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 9%, as compared to the second quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of 0% to 4%, and 5% growth on the first year effective acquisitions. The effect of currency translation is expected to be immaterial as compared to the prior year's second quarter based on the current exchange rate environment. And the midpoint of our revenue forecast, we expect gross margin to be 56% and operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 22% and equal to the second quarter a year ago. The short-term charges for acquired inventory are immaterial in the second quarter. At the midpoint of the range, sequential incremental operating margin is approximately 66% reflecting strong leverage on a sequential sales forecast increase of 14%. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $3.5 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30.5% resulting in second quarter forecasted diluted earnings in a range of $0.85 per share to $0.94 per share. At the midpoint of the range, diluted earnings per share would increase approximately 7% over the same period a year ago. In addition to the second quarter outlook, the following fiscal 2014 full year data points may be helpful for modeling purposes. We mentioned during our last call that we are forecasting a full year effective tax rate of about 30% assuming a continuation of the R&D tax credit. As this credit has not yet been extended for 2014, we are now forecasting a full year tax rate of approximately 30.5%. For capital spending in 2014, we are still forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be in line with 2013 or between $45 million to $50 million about 3% of 2013 sales. In summary, our first quarter reflects our normal seasonality with respect to sales volume along with the impact of both continued challenging macroeconomic conditions and certain unfavorable sector trends particularly in the mobile electronic space. We continue to generate strong levels of free cash flow during the quarter and we remain optimistic about our prospects over the long-term. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. At the midpoint of our second quarter guidance, sequential sales growth would be about 14% and we would expect to leverage this increase volume to deliver significantly higher operating margin and earnings as compared to the first quarter results. While this is encouraging, and acknowledging the macroeconomic environment has been a headwind, our sales growth has been below our long-term expectations in recent quarters. While we continue to manage spending where short-term conditions dictate, we do not intend to offer our basic strategy. Our view is that Nordson will continue to generate long-term value. As we look out over the next several quarters, let me add some specific perspective about why we're encouraged. Our organic growth strategy rest on best-in-class technology, direct customer service, diverse and growing end markets and emerging market penetration. All of these drivers are intact. On the technology side, we continue to introduce innovative products that provide value to our customers. Specific and notable for the first quarter is our patented new Wafer X (sic) X-ray Metrology platform. By focusing on wafer level inspection, this product offering provides a significant new market opportunity and we expect to begin generating revenue from this new platform in the back half of this year. This is one of several recent product introductions over the past year. More fundamentally, we continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunities afforded by our diverse end markets. Food and beverage markets provide excellent prospects for rigid and flexible packaging applications especially in emerging regions. The same is true for our products serving disposable personal hygiene applications. Medical applications are amongst the fastest growing in the company. And while demand in electronics end markets can vary from quarter-to-quarter, industry and technology trends in this space remain in our favor over the next several years. And we are well-positioned geographically to capture the increasing demand from emerging markets that benefit from each of these segments. We supplement our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. Our track record is one of acquiring good companies, improving their performance and fueling their growth. Recently, we had done just that with our acquisitions in the medical space. We are in the midst of doing the same with the suite of companies we have acquired in our polymer product line. While the polymer product line has faced some short-term headwinds in terms of demand driven by market dynamics, we expect performance will improve steadily and contribute long-term value to the shareholders. Overall, we continue to develop our acquisition pipeline and we have the financial and organizational capacity to continue to add properties that fit our strategy. As we look at our operating performance, we still see opportunities to improve margins. Our continuous improvement initiatives span engineering, operations, marketing, sales and functional areas. We also continue to accelerate and institute best practices across the company. We're making good progress, but have additional opportunity especially in the acquired property. Finally, our business continues to generate a high level of cash, which gives us the ability to continue our multi-faceted capital deployment strategy. In addition to funding organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, our strategy includes returning capital directly to shareholders. We have increased our dividend on average, 20% over the last three years as we move to a more reasonable payout ratio. In terms of share repurchases, we have been active under this program at a relatively modest level. We expect to become more aggressive towards completing our repurchase authorization during the balance of the fiscal year. In summary, our core strengths include innovative technology, diverse and growing end markets, direct global customer support, a continuous improvement mindset and strong cash generation for investment. These core strengths will continue to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. In summary, our fundamentals are intact and have not changed. At this time, let me turn to your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Mark Douglass : Hi. Good morning gentlemen. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Mark. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Mark. Mark Douglass : Can you discuss the \u2013 can you kind of reconcile the higher backlog, I mean you're up 4% organically, certainly the Kreyenborg in there, but still significant drop in orders, help us kind of reconcile what's happening with the order rates versus where your backlog is and some of this backlog going into third quarter, which is maybe why we're not seeing it in second quarter, you think it would be a little stronger organically in your second quarter guidance? Mike Hilton : Yes. Let me provide some couple of high level comments. If you look at sort of entering this quarter, we had pretty solid order rates, let's say they continued nicely up until we sort of hit the holiday period, and normally we see a pretty significant drop off in the holiday period. And the way I'd characterize that is, we've been a little slow to see that as orders pick up like they naturally do coming out of the holiday period. So we had sort of the western holidays combined with a little earlier Chinese New Year and they've been a little bit slow coming back out. What I would say though is if we look at sort of level of project and prospect activity and bid activity across most of our businesses and most of the geographies, that's pretty solid. We haven't seen all that translate into orders yet, but we're encouraged by what we see across most of the businesses. I'd make one specific comment around mobile. We had some continuing strength last year in the first quarter in terms of orders that we wouldn't necessarily typically see. And typically, we'd see Q2 and Q3 as the period of time where we'd see the mobile orders pickup based on launch, timing of new products. And I'd say we would expect to see that this year. The exact timing whether it's Q2 or Q3, not clear, but based on the projects we're working on, we're encouraged by what we see as the opportunity out there. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then, Greg, can you just walk us through how we get to 22% operating margin? And with little shortfall in 1Q that the gross margin of 56% year-over-year is a little - is a percentage point lower than 57% in the second quarter. Are you being aggressive on the target operating margin here? Do you think you're being conservative enough assuming you get into the sales guidance range? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Mark. I would say I don't think we're being aggressive in our guidance for this margin improvement. What's going to drive this improvement is that 16% or so sequential improvement in volume. And so with the level of gross margins that we deliver, with that kind of volume growth, there is a bit of some mix benefit in each one of the segments that will otherwise raise margins. But it's primarily the increasing volume that's going to improve our absorption rates as well. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then just switching gears a little bit on Freedom. Can you talk about the success of the launch just last year relative to other new product launches and has that also done a good job of stemming the entrance of new competitor? Mike Hilton : I would say on the Freedom side, we've had good acceptance in the marketplace. I'd say the mix that -- sort of a mix of different types of systems in the highest end systems under a Freedom unit go on to sort of the biggest end customers has been very successful, until some of the mid-Tier customers are testing the product, but didn't any other step up. So I'd say units are probably a little behind. Revenue probably on track, and profitability probably on track, and we're encouraged by the level of acceptance. I'd say from a material standpoint there's still some improvements coming from the adhesive suppliers that will add to the acceptance rate there. But we feel pretty good about that technology. Certainly we treat all of our competitors and potential competitors seriously that's why we continue to be the technology leader and innovate. And I'd say we've been fairly successful so far in what we've seen from Freedom. We have other versions of Freedom coming out to support our OEM in different applications later in the year, but right now I'd say a little behind on units but generally on track and revenue. Mark Douglass : Do these have higher than \u2013 like legacy products, better margin from legacy products or what can we say? Mike Hilton : What I would tell you is it varies on what a customer buys, so the most sophisticated piece includes the full system of the feed systems and the new controls and the new dispense technology and the melting approach. They've got a whole system that tends to give more performance than we get paid for the performance, if their volumes \u2013 certain components from that, I'd say it's typical of our historical margins. Mark Douglass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kevin Maczka : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Kevin. Greg Thaxton : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Maczka : Mike, can you revisit mobile again? It sounds like \u2013 I mean, that's clearly been one of the areas of strength for you in the last few years. And it sounds like that surprised to the negative very late in the quarter, but I'm taking from your comment about expecting better order trends in Q2 and Q3. If this isn't an issue that maybe we're not involved in some of the key model or product launches that are coming. So can you just kind of square what happened late in the quarter because maybe I missed it, but I didn't follow that. Mike Hilton : Yes. So I think your last comment is correct. So to be blunt, we don't think we're losing share in this \u2013 in the market. It really is linked to timing of launches. And if you go sort of year-on-year compared to last year, in the first quarter of last year, we had some, what I would say components related to mobile devices that were new and had some business in the quarter from that and that didn't repeat yet this year. So as we look at where our customers are looking to provide sort of the next launch and as we've said in the past, it's more important about what they change, whether it's the size or features to get more new systems and so it's really a function of new products. We are working with key customers on their new products and we'd expect orders to pick up. We're not 100% sure of how much will come in Q2 versus how much would come in Q3. And if you look back historically, it's been Q2 and Q3 into the early Q4 that have been stronger until the last year we had some additional benefit in Q1. And then from time to time, you can always have some orders here and there, push your core deal from one quarter to another. So yes, it was a little softer in the first quarter than we had seen last year. But if we look at the project activity, we feel encouraged and no, we don't think we're losing any share. Kevin Maczka : Okay. And then it sounds like you're reacting to some of the softness you'd seen here with new cost actions. Can you say a little bit more about that, and maybe describe what kind of magnitude or what type of initiatives you have? How much did that affect, or does that benefit you in terms of achieving that Q2 guidance or these longer-term type initiatives? Mike Hilton : Yes. So just a couple of high level comments. I think we've mentioned the last quarter that we are going to go in the year expecting to start out a little slowly but from a high-level guidance most people expected the global macro to be better in 2014 than 2013. And I would say that's still the case particularly with some improving strength in the U.S. and Europe coming off as zero. I'd say the start is slower like we anticipated and I think people are more cautious in emerging markets. That said, we are watching our discretionary spending. Last quarter we continue to do that. In addition, in some of our businesses we have built in flexible capacity to ramp up and ramp down as business moderate in the short-term and we're taking advantage of that in the short-term. Beyond that, we're looking at attrition and managing attrition, we're looking at when we bring on new hires for various applications. But in a couple of areas, select products and select geographies, we've also done some internal benchmarking and we're putting some plans in place, there'll be a cause to implement those plans and we'll see a net benefit this year, probably not much of an impact in Q2. We'll see a net benefit this year, it's not going to be material benefit but it'll be a net positive benefit. Kevin Maczka : Okay. So you've always been pretty tight with discretionary spend and you're always looking at other initiatives in the benchmarking and things that you mentioned. But this is not a big new sweeping at cost action in response to a material slowdown in the second half of the quarter? Mike Hilton : No, I would say it's more surgical, or we maybe got ahead of ourselves a little bit and we're addressing it to recognize in the current environment. Kevin Maczka : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Good morning. Mike Hilton : Hi, Matt. Matt Summerville : You mentioned Mike that you've gone through kind of this period of internal investment whether it'd be on product development side with Freedom developing more of a tiered product offering across the businesses, and then you also mentioned that you've been a little bit disappointed with the top line. So I'm wondering if you can kind of reconcile those two comments relating that where things not going right for Nordson in converting those internal efforts to top-line volume? Mike Hilton : Yes. So I talked a little bit about Freedom and I think we're pleased with the launch of that. We see that will continue to grow. Remember, we haven't really launched it in Asia yet. We're just doing that in the next few months, so we expect that to continue to trend up. We talked a little bit about the wafer project in my comment. That's the one where we spent a fair bit of money last year on. We've done a lot of testing with customers. We've got some good interest to the first part of Qs that are coming in. So that's encouraging. That's going to be second half of the year orders and then beyond that, but we're encouraged by the customer reaction so far from the launch and that's a brand-new technology area for us. I'd say we have some other areas in the electronics related space that are coming in. Again, the medical space, we've been introducing a number of new products and getting really good traction on that so far. I'd say the areas where things are a little softer \u2013 I think geographically, we've seen some softness in Asia and in China particular. And I think some of that is related to sort of macro transition to the consumption-related economy. Now, that said, we have good prospects and projects out there and some of our core businesses like the adhesive packaging and nonwovens businesses have finally ticked up the nice orders there. We've had some anomalies on package \u2013 on product assembly with year-on-year kind of timing of orders, but the sort of core packaging has picked up. Similarly, in the coatings business, things like big auto platform, orders can vary year-to-year and we've seen some of that come through in the first quarter. So I would say we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the product piece. We're seeing some select geographic macro impacts, and I think timing on the mobile piece has been a pretty, a big impact here and that reflects over to geography too because most of that is in Asia. Greg Thaxton : Matt, this is Greg. Just to add a comment on Tiering. I think as we've characterized in the past, we're much further along with that endeavor within the adhesive segment, and are doing very well in those Tiering opportunities particularly in the emerging markets. It's still an area where we have upside within both Advanced Technology and Industrial Coatings. So that's a particularly area where we think we have growth opportunity yet going forward. Mike Hilton : Yes. And then I'd say as Industrial Coatings, we're making good progress. I'd say on the Advanced Tech, it was all about building our capability in Suzhou and we're just sort of launching the first products there really in the next couple of months. Matt Summerville : And just a follow up on the margin performance in Advanced Tech, I went back and looked at the last time Nordson generated roughly $97 million, $98 million in revenue. That would've been the first quarter of 2011, and I know this isn't completely comparable, but your margins then were 24%. Today they're 11%. I guess I'm trying to understand how you get that sort of \u2013 I mean the detrimental year-over-year was 93%. So I guess I'm trying to understand more behind that math there? Mike Hilton : Yes. So I think that's an area where we consciously stepped up spending to invest both in technology, and we're in the midst of this transition to the East. Naturally, we've got I'd say some one-time cost there in terms of the technology step up and some one-time costs that weren't in 2011 from the transition over to building our capability in Asia and the revenue is trailing the -- that investment. So we are making some adjustments in the short-term, but in the long-term, that doesn't surprise us given that the revenue would typically trail the introduction of both the capability and new products. I'd say in a very short-term, we had significantly lower orders and it's tough to adjust your fixed cost back in the early short-term and that's part of what you're seeing as well, it's kind of a significant negative incremental margins associated with that. Matt Summerville : And then just lastly real quick with the whole mobile space, I mean we know that there's obviously peaks and valleys there, do you think this is nothing more than just a deeper valley, which is going to be followed by a higher peak? Is that the right way to be thinking about this? You're kind of in this deeper low right now and you're going to get that big boom in the back half of the year? Mike Hilton : So I think we expect to see orders step up nicely here from the sort of new platform releases. And so the one overarching comment I would make is that we benefit in the last couple of years with the penetration of smartphones and I think as we've talked about in the past, the smartphones are important because of all the functionality in there and the small geography. So if you look at I think, penetration is pretty high on smartphones now. So I'd say going forward, we're likely not to have that benefit by the same silicon people are constantly looking at different form factors and features, and so I think there's a benefit there. And then there's a whole group of new customers who really do think manually today. And so I think a potential upside for us to maybe offset that penetration piece, is to what degree of those other competitors automate. I think from a cost perspective, ultimately they're going to want to do that. But right now they do things fairly manually. So I think in the near term as a question of the timing of that stepping up versus sort of the base business, which is driven by kind of the new product launches and the change in functionality. So I'd say we've benefited nicely from that penetration, and the launch piece has been fairly constant and so there's some other things that people are getting into, like variables that could create some opportunities. So I think we would expect it to be at a significant level going forward year-to-year you could have some swings. Matt Summerville : Thanks a lot, guys. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Charley Brady : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Hilton : Hey, Charley. Charley Brady : On the Advanced Tech, can we just dig into that a little bit more and you covered kind of a mobile side of it, but I wonder you talked about most of the business is up, and mobile is down. Can you give us some more granularity about the various sub-businesses and degree of which they were either plus or minus in the quarter? Mike Hilton : Yes. So if I'd look at sort of staying on the system sort of side of things, I'd say the expense base is really largely syntax was off pretty significantly. The March business which is a service trade was up nicely. The test inspection business which includes bond testers and X-ray was up nicely. Particularly encouraging is the bond test piece being up pretty strong which kind of indicates the maybe the semi piece is coming back. We also had some dispense opportunities in more traditional packaging come through which is also another encouraging sign that's not necessarily mobile-related. We're not jumping up ringing the bell yet, but that was encouraging. So on the \u2013 now if we go to the EFB side, I'd say the markets that were medical, very strong, the general assembly is strong. I'd say the electronics was just okay. Components were okay, but we had some tabletop-type systems last year that were a little stronger than this year and that's really a mobile effect for the guys that do sort of semi-automation. But I'd say the core EFB-type businesses were strong and the metal piece were strong. Our biggest impact, as Greg talked about earlier, was in sort of the high-end dispense systems that were pretty soft relative to last year. Charley Brady : Okay. And just on the coatings business, did I hear you correctly that you had some slippage from Q1 into, I don't know, Q2 or Q3? Mike Hilton : No. I think the way I would describe the coatings business is, if you look at what we typically see, it's a pretty soft Q1 because most of the time, it's linked to capital budgets. We still have time to get formalized till end of January. So typical Q1 will be soft and we pick up Q2, Q3, Q4, with three and four typically being the strongest. Last year was a little unusual. And we had a really strong Q4 and a carryover strong Q1 in terms of revenue and order entry and we've seen a more typical year \u2013 this year in terms of the first quarter. So for example, I think Greg mentioned that Q1 was like 38% over the prior year and we're into a more typical year. What I would say is, if we look at orders to-date and backlog in that business, it's filling in pretty nicely for Q2. And we look at prospects going forward, it looks pretty solid. We do have bigger systems in that. So for example, we had some strong auto platform orders last year that didn't come through, again, the order entry rates this year and they are kind of more digital and so it looks \u2013 it magnifies sort of the year-over-year difference there. But I think Greg's comments we look at things like powder and some of our liquid business. It's encouraging and when we look sort of the bid activity it's encouraging later in the year. So it's the short-term anomalies, I'd say there more than anything else. Charley Brady : Okay. And just on your year-end guidance organic growth of zero to plus 4%, I guess when we look at the orders down 4%, a fairly decent indicator of kind of more near term sales outlook. So I guess I'm just trying to square the zero to plus 4% with the minus 4% order rate in the most recent 12 weeks. You're really expecting adhesive dispensing to pick up on a sales basis organically higher than that 5% order rate you've seen? Or am I missing something here? Mike Hilton : Yes, so I think you need to kind of take into account two things. It's a combination of backlog and recent order rates. So if you look and just go back to the prior quarter, you guys were correctly asking us a different question which is your order rate looked good why are you forecasting what you're forecasting? It was because our backlog was down year-on-year. So right now our backlog is up about 4% I think year-over-year. And that's really the strength that we saw in orders coming through October-November and it kind of tailed off over the holidays. And as I mentioned earlier, it's been a little slow to come back. So if you say that's up plus 4%, and you look at our current order rates, and basically some bid activity we think it's not just sort of plus 4%, minus 4%, that's zero, but it's a little bit better than that we think. So it's kind of that combination of backlog and recent orders that you need to look at to make a judgment. We feel like we've provided through our best guidance here based on what we see and it's a combination of those two. Charley Brady : Okay. Thanks Mike. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ursaner with CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Jason Ursaner : Good morning. Mike Hilton : Hey, Jason. Greg Thaxton : Hi, Jason. Jason Ursaner : On the gross margin guidance of 56% at the midpoint, Q1's typically represented the high point of the year for you guys. So just wondering, I mean, is this a negative operating leverage from the tech segment or is there something else going on in terms of mix as you look out to the balance of the year in Q2? Mike Hilton : Yes. I mean typically \u2013 that's generally correct, Jason, because typically, we have low systems orders and higher parts orders. But that sort of nuance is being overshadowed by \u2013 where we're at on the tech mobile side right now and the sort of negative incremental margin in the short-term. Greg Thaxton : Yes. So our spare parts percentage of sales was pretty consistent with the prior year first quarter. It's primarily the \u2013 absorption issue in a couple of the pockets of the business. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And the guidance is implying SG&A run rate for Q2 that's pretty consistent with Q1. Would you expect a similar run rate on SG&A in the back of your fiscal year given that you're pulling back on some spending? And how much variance is there that's sales-driven for the back half? Mike Hilton : Yes. So I would say typically, if you look at our year over the last couple of years, we step up in the first quarter with merits and things like that. And then in the last couple of years where we've been investing, it stepped up. Obviously, we're moderating that step-up and looking at making some other modest changes. So I think the second half of the year, you'll see some moderation there, but there'll be some cost implements so you'll have that muted a little bit. But I wouldn't say we'd see the same step up that we have in the last couple of years. Greg Thaxton : Yes. We will have the impact if we see as this typical an increasing volume pattern in the back half of the year will have some increase in SG&A that goes with commissions and the like. So generally, we have an increasing spend pattern. In the back half, as Mike I think that'll be muted a bit with some of these actions we're taking. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And then the adhesive segment, you mentioned that operating margin excluding Kreyenborg was up year-to-year versus 24% last year. I guess I'm just wondering it's still about 1,000 basis points below the margin from the years before that. So is it permanent dilution from the EDI and Xaloy acquisitions, or if we stripped out the plastics with the standard adhesive systems that you mentioned for consumer non-durables, will that still be generating that load in mid-30's operating margin? Greg Thaxton : Yes. So the core is still going to be above 30. I mean depending what point you pick, we had a couple of quarters there where it's like all time highs. But yes, it's conceptually has not changed. We do have a big mix effect and as we continue to add the acquisitions, we have sort of where we had that same kind of mixed effect. I think what we said to you is we needed, we got businesses that were kind of in the mid-teens on a EBITDA kind of margin that we wanted them to move into the mid-20s and that was going to be a sort of a multi-year program to get there and not wanted, but probably more like three or four. And we're on path to do that. They got hurt a little bit in the short-term because volumes were off in those businesses but we're encouraged right now as orders are trending up nicely, high single digits in the polymer business in this last quarter and that's really without the biax business coming back yet. And some encouraging signs there and that OEMs are starting to work on projects that would probably translate into orders in the back half of this year. So our broadening efforts from a product line standpoint are bearing fruits, so encouraging indications there from an order standpoint that should play out over time. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And in the tech segment, the challenge in mobile for automated expense, you mentioned unit volume growth slowing from some market saturation but you've also talked about the form factor challenge. So I guess how are you looking at both of those and which is playing a bigger issue with \u2013 I guess capacity being sufficient for that market right now? Mike Hilton : Well, I'd say the saturation in the short-term, if you think about three or four years ago was 15%, 20% and now it's up closer to 80%, 90% kind of penetration. Varying degrees of the smartphones and fairly cheap low featured to fully featured, but that certainly has an impact. I think things that can't drive it from a form factor or to certain customers go to different geographies and also just their continued push to go thinner. That's a good thing for us if there's a continued push to go thinner for example. And then are there extra capabilities that people want to build in whether that has to do with things like fingerprint centers and that kind of stuff, or other kinds of things that they want to put in the films that's a good thing. I would say if you look at the new guys on the scene which tend to be Taiwanese and Chinese vendors, they're just sort of stepping up into the smartphone space and they do everything manually, as I said, today. So I think the offsetting piece there for the penetration of the smartphone side would be growth in business and share their \u2013 convincing those folks to go to a more automated approach. I think things like driving cost and availability of workforce in China will ultimately push them there, but may take a little while to get to that point. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And the new technology in wafer level inspection is that exclusively on the packaging side or there's also a potential front-end use? Mike Hilton : Yes. On the tail-end, generally, it's wafer level packaging, so from the tail-end to the front-end. So if you think about what customers do today is they optically inspect wafers. But as they've gone vertical in particular and reduce \u2013 and increase density, optical doesn't work so well and what they've done is historically use X-ray to sample. But as they put more and more value on a wafer, they're looking to do in-line X-ray. And so our offering here is, in effect, the first in-line X-ray, a machine to help multiple-layer chips and high-density wafers. So it's really at the tail-end of the front-end. And what isn't clear yet is, is this going to be a 100% solution, is it still going to be a sampling solution, but an upgraded sampling solution. But there \u2013 very encouraged by what we can provide from a capability that they can't get anywhere from optical and it's much better than 3% or 4%sampling kind of approach. So very encouraging early on, obviously this will materialize into orders but the reaction so far is very positive. Jason Ursaner : Okay, great. Appreciate all the commentary. Thanks. Mike Hilton : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke of Janney Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Liam Burke : Mike, sales were up nicely in Europe, and then it looks like orders are doing pretty well, too. Could you give us a sense of what the make up of that businesses, is it systems being sold for export, or are you seeing actual in-demand in the different countries? Mike Hilton : Yes, it's a bit of both. I think what you're referring to is particularly in our adhesives area where we have both OEMs for things like nonwoven as well as in our new businesses in the polymer area there are number of OEMs there. You were seeing improvement there. But we're also seeing some improvements in the core adhesive non-durables in Europe. Last year and a half has been pretty soft there and with the zero to minus GDP that's not surprising. And a reduction in things like food and beverage consumption that's packaged, but we're starting to see that turnaround. I'd say even in our technology business, electronics related it's been an improvement there, largely automotive-related and applications we have for the automotive side. And I'd say even some modest improvement in the colorings area from some certain applications. So kind of across the board it's encouraging. We'd like to see more quarters play out to make sure the trend sticks. But if you look at sort of some of the things you're hearing out of Germany, for example, it's been more encouraging in kind of Northern Europe, more encouraging in maybe parts of Eastern Europe, more encouraging. So we're hoping that's a trend that will continue, but it's been pretty much across-the-board in the last quarter or so. Liam Burke : Great. Thank you. And when you purchased the polymer lines, product lines last several years, you had anticipated that it will probably grow at a faster rate than the traditional adhesives business. As we get into the second half of the year, do you expect those growth rates to step up to those types of levels? Mike Hilton : Yes. I'd say if you look at the underlying demand for plastic, it's still growing faster than, say, in flexible packaging versus rigid packaging even though we're seeing a bit of the investment cycle versus the consumption cycle impact us, particularly in the biax film which we talked about. So even in this period over the last year to year-and-a-half, the underlying growth of the flexible piece has continued to grow faster than rigid packaging. So we see that underlying demand continuing to grow. I think for us, the big uptick will come when we start to see the biax line being purchased because those are our sophisticated lines. And so I'd say an encouraging sign as we talk to OEMs in particular is that they're starting to see interest from the end customers around putting these new lines in. So I'd say we expect to see orders start to pick up at the second half of the year, and most industry analysts are predicting 2015 and 2016 to be really solid years in this business. So in the interim, what we have done particularly in the parts of our business that are in the extrusion side has come up with new products in three other areas that aren't sort of biax film-related area and we're getting good traction on that right now which is why we're seeing some orders start to tick up there. And then on the new businesses, they've been pretty solid. The ones acquired just last year had been pretty solid from a backlog and from a order entry perspective. So yes, I think that fundamentals of the plastics business and the substitution of plastic and the growth, preferential growth in emerging markets, nothing has changed in that. It's really getting the investment of supply demand imbalance there. Liam Burke : Thank you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Global Hunter. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike Hilton : Hi, Walt. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Walt. Walter Liptak : Thanks for all the color on the advance tech part of the business. So I want to ask a question on kind of the long-term growth rate based on your comments. If we look at the order trend over the last six data points that you gave us, we're at about flat. And your comments are positive over the next couple of years. What kind of growth rate should we be expecting from advance tech when we kind of roll up the semiconductor part mobile, et cetera, is this a mid-single digit grower in the future? Mike Hilton : No, we think it's still sort of in that high single-digit range. First of all, things like medical had grown strongly double digits. Some of our general assembly kind of applications are growing strongly. I think we're expecting to see some improvement in I'd say, the quarter semi piece of our electronics business where we really haven't seen for two years, the analysts project this year to be kind of a mid-single digits growth rate and next year to be a nice double-digit growth \u2013 growth rate and you're starting to hear from some of the front-end guys that things are picking up and improving there. And that semi piece of our business we hope to come back. We haven't seen too much activity in the last year on the OED side, but customers are starting to tell us that they expect there'll be placed some more orders this year for the lighting aspect and that'll be starting to impact us probably later in the year and the next year if they're correct. And then I'd say the \u2013 we talked about this in the past, there's the whole part of the market that I alluded in the previous comment when we talked about some of these new mobile guys, but other applications for PCs and servers where you've got people that still do things by hand that we'd like to convert to our lower-featured automation platform, and we're only now getting in the position of launching our sort of first offering out of Suzhou and over the next couple of years, we'd expect to have a more fulsome portfolio to offer from a tiering perspective. So we haven't seen that play out. The other things that we talked about like the penetration benefit of smartphones, that's gone away. So we're counting a number of other things to coming into play over the next couple of years to help us get back into more of the higher single-digit range. Walter Liptak : Okay, fair enough. When I look at the volatility in the orders, especially over the last two or three quarters, is that something that we should get used to, this lumping \u2013 more lumpiness in orders like a little bit less consistent even if we get to that ultimately the high-single digit revenue growth? Mike Hilton : Well, I think the biggest variability tend to be in the electronics piece, and electronics in general has a different sort of cycle than regular business cycle or the more steady nature of our sort of consumer non-durable businesses. But I think what you see is more launch-related kind of activity in the mobile space, which is typically, I think, adding a little bit to the volatility in the short-term. Walter Liptak : Okay. Thank you. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow-up question from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Mark Douglass : Hi. Just real quickly, Greg, what was the pre-tax charge for the inventory step-up and is there any more coming in 2Q? You ended some of these in 2Q last quarter. I'm just wondering if it's all out. Greg Thaxton : Yes. The pre-tax was about $2.3 million and given actual inventory turns; it's an immaterial amount that will hit in the second quarter. So I'd say those charges are behind us now. Mark Douglass : Okay. Thank you. Jim Jaye : And, Nicole, with that, I think we're going to have to end our call. This is Jim. Thanks for participating. If you have follow-ups, I'll be around today and be glad to take those. So thank you very much for joining us today. Mike Hilton : Yes. Thank you. We really appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host Mr. Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Amanda and good morning to all who are listening. I am here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We would like to welcome you to our conference call today, Friday May 23, 2014 on Nordson\u2019s second quarter results. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at www.nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until June 6th by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 41277438. During this conference call forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks we will have a question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our second quarter 2014 results and a bit about our 2014 third quarter outlook. Please go ahead, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. And thank you for attending Nordson's second quarter 2014 conference call. Nordson delivered strong performance in the quarter with sales at the top end of our guidance and earnings per share a few cents above our top end. I want to thank our global team for delivering both the top line and bottom line while continuing to execute on strategic initiatives, continuous improvement projects, acquisition integration and targeted cost reductions. Given the soft macroeconomic environment I am pleased with the solid organic growth of 4% in the quarter. This growth was broad-based and included the majority of our product lines and regions. On a sequential basis sales increased by 16% over the first quarter which we leveraged to generate incremental operating margin of 67% in the second quarter. We also executed on our strategy of returning value to our shareholders by investing $53 million for the repurchase of shares and by distributing approximately $12 million in dividends during the quarter. Looking ahead, based on our current backlog, order rates and customer projects we are anticipating continued strong performance in our third quarter. In a few moments I\u2019ll share additional comments about current business trends and our near term outlook. But first I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer who will provide more detail commentary on our second quarter financial results and our third quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you and good morning to everyone. Sales in the second quarter were $417 million, an increase of 9% over the prior year second quarter. The sales improvement included a 4% increase in organic volume and a 5% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions. The effect of currency translation compared to the same period a year ago was not material. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment; Adhesive Dispensing sales volume increased 18% as compared to the prior year second quarter. Organic growth was 8% and the first year effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition added growth of 10%. Organic growth was driven by rigid packaging, general product assembly, disposable hygiene and polymer processing end markets. And we saw strength in every geography with the exception of Japan. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment decreased 3% from the prior year second quarter. Solid organic growth in products for electronics, test and inspection, fluid management and surface treatment end markets was offset by softness in demand for automated dispensing equipment and selected mobile electronic device end markets. As noted in our press release we have begun to see an increase in orders and projects for these automated systems in recent weeks which we'll benefit the second half of the year. Geographically organic growth in the U.S. and Europe during the second quarter was offset by softness in other regions. Industrial Coating Systems sales volume increased 4% compared to the second quarter a year ago. This organic growth was driven by demand in consumer durable and industrial end markets, food and beverage end markets and UV curing systems for industrial and electronics end markets. The growth was broad-based with increases in all regions except the Americas as compared to the same period a year ago. Overall gross margin in the second quarter was 56.4%, an increase of more than 200 basis points from the level we delivered in the first quarter of 2014 driven by better absorption and product mix. Moving down the income statement, operating profit was $93 million and operating margin was 22% in the second quarter or 23% on a normalized basis that excludes the non-recurring charge related to targeted restructuring activities. This normalized margin is an improvement of 100 basis points over the same period a year ago inclusive of the dilutive effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition and an improvement of 700 basis points on a sequential basis reflecting the leverage we generate on additional sales volume. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis; Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 27% in the quarter, up 100 basis points over the second quarter a year ago and up 400 basis points on a sequential basis. Within the Advanced Technology segment operating margin was 24% in the quarter or 25% excluding non-recurring restructuring charges. This normalized margin of 25% represents an increase of 14 percentage points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In the Industrial Coating segment operating margin was 16% in the second quarter, an increase of 100 basis points over the prior year second quarter and 700 basis points over the first quarter of fiscal 2014. As Mike noted previously on a total company basis we were able to leverage strong sequential sales growth to generate incremental operating margin of 67% or 69% excluding the one-time restructuring cost incurred in the quarter. Continuing down the income statement reported net income for the quarter was $62 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.96, an increase of 14% over the second quarter a year ago. The current quarter's earnings per share including $0.01 charge related to restructuring cost. As in previous quarters we've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain items. On a normalized basis to exclude one-time items in both years second quarter earnings per share increased 15% over the prior year second quarter. The current quarter's EBITDA was $107 million, up 13% as compared to the same period a year ago, cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $55 million and free cash flow before dividends was $46 million. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. Mike previously commented on our execution during the quarter of returning value directly to shareholders whereby we invested $53 million for the repurchase of shares and distributed $12 million in dividends. We have approximately $141 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization at the end of the second quarter and do expect to remain active in the market as the year progresses. From a balance sheet perspective we remain very liquid with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.6 times trailing 12 month EBITDA as of the end of our second quarter. And we have approximately $280 million available from cash and our current revolving credit facility for strategic investment opportunities. I\u2019ll move on now to comments regarding our outlook for the third quarter and I will note that we began the quarter with strong order trends. As we typically do we have provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with the Kreyenborg acquisition included in both years. For the 12-weeks ending May 18, 2014 order rates are up 9% as compared to the same 12-weeks in the prior year. Order rates were robust in all segments and most all geographies with the exception of Europe which was impacted primarily by slower demand in electronics and durable goods end markets. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment order rates over the last 12 weeks increased 7% compared to the same period in the prior year. Order rates increased in all regions and nearly every product line. Strength in rigid packaging, disposable hygiene and general product assembly end markets was offset by softness in certain polymer processing end markets. In the Advanced Technology segment order rates over the latest 12 weeks are up 14% compared to the same period in the prior year. Order rates increased for every product line and included the return of solid demand for automated dispensing systems related to mobile electronic device applications. Within the Industrial Coatings segment latest 12-week order rates are up 4% as compared to the prior year. This order growth was driven by strong demand for cold material dispensing and liquid painting product lines. Order growth was strongest in the U.S. and Asia Pacific within the segment. Backlog as of April 30, 2014 was approximately $247 million, an increase of 25% compared to April 30, 2013 and inclusive of 10% organic growth and 15% growth due to the Kreyenborg acquisition. Backlog at April 30, 2014 increased 7% compared to January 31, 2014. Backlog amounts are calculated at April 30, 2014 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. We are forecasting sales growth to be in the range of 9% to 13% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of 3% to 7%, 5% growth from the first year effect of acquisitions and a positive 1% currency translation effect based on the current exchange rate environment. At the midpoint of our sales forecast we expect third quarter gross margin to be between 56% and 57% and operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 24% or 100 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. We are estimating third quarter interest expense of about $3.5 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30.5% resulting in third quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.06 per share to $1.16 per share. The midpoint of this range for diluted earnings per share represents an increase of 10% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter reported earnings per share or 12% excluding certain non-recurring items reported in the prior year. In summary our global team delivered solid second quarter results and based on our current backlog and order rates our outlook represents strong performance in the third quarter. In addition to this third quarter outlook the following fiscal 2014 full year data points maybe helpful for modeling. We are forecasting a full year tax rate of approximately 30.5% based on current tax log. For capital spending in 2014 we are forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be about $40 million. In addition to this maintenance capital spending we will be making capital investments over the next several quarters as part of our global footprint optimization activities. Specifically we have begun the construction of a manufacturing facility to support growing demand in our advanced technology fluid management product line supporting medical end markets. The new facility will be built in Loveland, Colorado and we will exit a leased in nearby Fort Collins, Colorado. This investment supports our strategy of owning our critical manufacturing facilities and will provide us with configurable space to minimize expense and disruption as business needs may change. We anticipate total capital investment for the project to be $26 million with approximately one half of this investment to be incurred during fiscal 2014 and the remainder during the first half of fiscal 2015 and full year operations are anticipated to begin in the first half of 2015. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions I like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. And again I want to thank the global team for the value they provide our customers at a high level of execution. The midpoint of our sales guidance represents organic growth of 5% over the prior year third quarter and 7% for sales growth over the second quarter of 2014. And we expect to leverage this growth with both a year-over-year and sequential improvement in operating margin and strong growth in earnings per share. As we mentioned in our last conference call swings in the external environment can and do occur from quarter-to-quarter. At the same time we do not intent to alter our basic objective and we remain confident that the Nordson business model is intact and will continue to create value over the long term. The model rests on a global team that can be counted on to continue executing at a high level and a passion for providing our customers with differentiated technology and superior global support. In the near term the team will remain focused on driving top line growth from targeted initiatives, continuing the integration activities of recent acquisitions and using continuous improvement initiatives to enhance operating performance. At this time let\u2019s turn to your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks, good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. Christopher Glynn : I was just looking for some non-initial color on how you are seeing the engagement by customers around your Suzhou efforts, how that\u2019s going? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, so we are just in the process of continuing to transfer products there. So we don\u2019t have everything transferred yet, but we\u2019ve sort of completed our first round of development on sort of mid-tier product and will be launching that very shortly in the market place. We\u2019ve had some interesting engagement with a number of the mobile players in the Chinese market and had some [referral] sales come through. So at this point we are trying to assess their needs to sort of fine tune our offerings there out of the Suzhou facility. But we still have a little work to do to transfer some other capability there. Christopher Glynn : Okay, and then on the polymer processing markets would you characterize that as largely over the hump of capacity absorption or still little ambiguity hanging around? Michael F. Hilton: I would say it's not too much different than what we\u2019ve said last quarter. You will recall it's really been the extrusion part of that market and the biaxial film that has the over-capacity and we expected to see orders come in towards the tail end of this year as OEM projects evolve and so we expect that really tail end of this year to see some orders come through and a step up in the next couple of orders and that\u2019s still what we expect. In the interim as we mentioned last time we\u2019ve been pursuing other markets like [Guangzhou, biax] film and have had some good success with our new offerings in those spaces. And we\u2019ve gotten some traction as we\u2019ve build out our facilities in Asia and approved lead times in a number of our product lines there. So I\u2019d say it's encouraging based on what we see today but the capacity issue in the biax film is not cleared yet and we kind of expect that as something that starts to clear up at the tail end of this year. Christopher Glynn : Great, thanks for the help. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. John Franzreb : Good morning Mike and Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, John. John Franzreb : I wonder if you could talk a little bit about AT, on the order rebound you saw in the quarter you mentioned that you're seeing some traction in the mobile side of the market how much of that year-over-year rebound can you attribute to the mobile side coming back? Michael F. Hilton: Well if you go back to some of our comments last quarter and they continue here, when we look across the whole technology space so far this year medical has been very strong; our general fluid management markets have been solid; our other electronic areas like the surface treatment and test business have been solid and it really was the more sophisticated dispense piece that was struggling a little bit out of the gate. And as we said last quarter typically we see orders come in second quarter, third quarter, may be even into the fourth quarter. And I would say what we're seeing here is really the tail end of the second quarter significant orders start to come through and we expect that to continue in the third quarter. So a significant improvement in the step up on the order trend as it has come from the high end high speed dispense in the mobile space. John Franzreb : And what's the sustainability of that kind of an order trend Mike do you think it's just one or two quarter trend, do you think it's a couple of years of being down it might have a little bit more legs to it? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, so what I tried to paint a picture of last time was what we see as sort of the long term situation here in the mobile space. One, the penetration of smartphone in general has moved from a relatively lower number I think we threw out 15%-20% if you went back number of years so pretty high number, say 80%. So we see that trend slowing a bit and moving ultimately more towards just smartphone overall growth. But by the same token we see some players today who are upgrading their capability and moving from say less smartphones to the smartphone space and we saw an opportunity for our mid-tier products which is what we're really trying to do out of Suzhou. That hasn't changed. So the question really is what's the timing of those two things and do they match up and line up? And not 100% clear yet. I mentioned a minute ago that we've got some orders now with some of these folks and we're trying to feel out both the sophistication of their end product and the processes that they'll use. So we have to see how that plays out over time. I would say there would be continued growth. It might be a little lumpy from time to time. And then I would say within the year we clearly have a seasonal pattern within the year where things start to pick up in the second quarter and third quarter and slowdown in the fourth and are pretty soft in the first. As that varies from time to time this year it seems to be fairly concentrated. John Franzreb : Okay, and the expansion in the medical side can you give us a little bit more color what business line that is what's driving the expansion? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah we're seeing very good growth both in the Value Plastics business that we bought, sustained double-digit growth in that business as well as solid growth in the dispense syringe-related business of Micromedics. We had a product line last year in the [stop cap] arena that is also growing. So that business is growing nicely and as we continue to expand the product line both organically and with sort of these tuck-in acquisitions we see really good growth opportunity there. We also took a holistic look at all of our fluid management facilities and we do think we can serve some of their expansion needs as well through this investment. So sort of an overall supply chain look beyond just a medical piece to support growth over say the next three to five years in those areas as well. John Franzreb : One last question, in Europe orders are flat year-over-year, lot of lumpiness in the order patterns if you look backwards. Electronics had good orders can you kind of reconcile what's going on in Europe that we are having good orders in electronics but flat in overall book in Europe as a region? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah so I think Europe kind off parallels the general what you see growing in the economy. If you think back last year we were still in a recession in Europe over the last couple of quarters things have gotten considerably better but by the same token if you look at the latest data coming out of Europe it's stepped backwards again. And so we\u2019ve seeing a little bit of that fits and starts, I think overall from an order perspective particularly for the larger engineered systems that tend to be capital related. And then with electronic specifically it really is linked into what\u2019s going on in the auto industry and the penetration in the auto industry more than anything else in Europe and so that what we are seeing continued penetration there which is an encouraging sign. And then I would say our sort of core adhesives business is finally coming back in Europe and that looks encouraging. Even though orders in this quarter are softer we do have good prospect list there. I think it really comes down to what\u2019s the macro-environment that we see and with continued mixed signals that we could be up and down a little bit here just depending on how the economy plays out. John Franzreb : Okay, thank you, Mike. That's nice of you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kevin R. Maczka: Thanks good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning Kevin. Kevin R. Maczka: Mike did adhesives order rates accelerate as the quarter progressed or even beyond the quarter as well and this may be kind of an apples and oranges comparison. But we are seeing better organic growth there and to the extent to that\u2019s the pent up demand finally being released, it sounds like your demand was fairly broad-based but lots of other industrials are just not seeing that or seeing continue push outs and delays. So I am just trying to understand may be where you are different and if it\u2019s may be a function of you being shorter cycle and seeing acceleration more recently? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, so if you look at the business, Kevin I think the consumer non-durable related piece is what has been strongest; so the packaging side of business in particular and nonwovens as well. I\u2019d say the product assembly which tends to be more durable construction-related has been up but not nearly to the same extent as the other two. And as you recall we had kind of as you kind of alluded to here we had a kind of softer here last year in the sort of consumer nondurable and I think we are seeing that pent-up demand come through and we are trying to drive new opportunities through technology and applications and we are seeing some traction there. And I\u2019d say the one that\u2019s not as robust is the product assembly piece that goes into those two areas of construction and durable good although was up. Kevin R. Maczka: How much of the strength in the order book there is related to new products like the Freedom product versus just the demand, the tone of demand in the end markets being better? Michael F. Hilton: It's primarily driven by the end markets. I\u2019d say we are on track with where we thought we would be on Freedom and in fact we just introduced in May next a year down version of Freedom we call Liberty to address a little bit broader aspect of the market. I think as you know we mentioned we target Freedom at the high end and the customers that are at the high end really appreciate that but where there are some opportunity for some sort of pairing structure we\u2019ve come out with another offering there. So I\u2019d say we are generally on track with the new initiatives, but the biggest drivers really are pick up in the market and quite frankly us winning in the market place and taking advantage of that. And we also as you know have a large installed base. So we are continuing to push using technology to help improve and update our customers' capability. Kevin R. Maczka: Okay, and just finally from me. We had a small restructuring charge this quarter, now you\u2019ve got the tech expansion coming in Colorado. I think in terms of your footprint you are usually able to slight go up and down pretty easily given the assembly nature you have. How are we doing in terms of capacity elsewhere? Should we expect other additions will be required here as we go forward and grow? Michael F. Hilton: Now we are in pretty good shape elsewhere. I think we\u2019ve talked over the last couple of years about the first the physical expansion in places like Suzhou and the build out of the product line there, with some of the acquisitions we've got additional capability in China and Thailand and it would build up capability there. Here we had a leased facility that we quite frankly we just outgrew given the significant growth we had in that business and in some of the discussions we had around some of the newer facilities and capability that have come with acquisitions there\u2019s some opportunity to optimize. So I'd say we are in pretty good shape here. This was something that from day one we knew if we get the growth rate targets in the middle of this we would need to expand and as Greg said wherever we can prefer to own the manufacturing facilities as opposed to lease it, particularly for businesses where we see the long term future looking bright. Kevin R. Maczka: Okay, thank you. Michael F. Hilton: All right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Charles D. Brady: Hey, thanks, good morning guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Charles. Charles D. Brady: Can you just give us the breakdown of the parts percentage by individual segments and particular ease of dispensing of the order? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, overall I think the parts we\u2019re just looking for a number here Charlie; in the quarter overall parts were about 41%. Adhesives generally tends to be higher than that but I think with the significant step up in systems orders that we have seen really in that business all year it\u2019s not too different from that 41% and that\u2019s really true across the segment. They are not too far off from that total company average, clearly more system sales in the second quarter versus first quarter. So it makes us move a couple or three points from the first quarter. Charles D. Brady: All right and can you discuss were there any large nonwovens big large systems, lumpy stuff in the quarter? Michael F. Hilton: No, I think we've had a steady inflow of new orders in the nonwovens side. I would say nothing that we would call out in that regard. Typically in the adhesives segment the product assembly is the area where we could have some also, some bigger systems and in the first quarter we had some comparisons that were tough versus last year because we had some big solo orders last year that didn\u2019t recur yet this year, that may well come later in the year. So I would say nothing that we would point out significantly, just a nice steady improvement in the packaging area which tends to be smaller systems and improvement nicely in the nonwovens that tend to be bigger systems but nothing that I would call out as a notable difference. Charles D. Brady: All right, okay. And just if you look at the value of plastics business for a second can you just give us maybe an update on the non-medical part of that business? It's a small piece obviously but that was an area I think when you bought that company you thought that maybe you could leverage that up and accelerate that because it was kind of under invested by the prior owner. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah I would say that an area probably that hasn\u2019t grown as fast as we would have expected. We had some additional traction on the industrial space. We segmented it into certain markets we think are most attractive to the level of sophistication in the components but that\u2019s not moving as fast as we would have anticipated. On the other hand the broadening of the product line organically and taking advantage of geographic penetrations probably move faster than we thought. So overall I think we are probably on track. But the industrial piece is not growing as fast as we would have anticipated and the segments that are high end are doing better than some of the others that maybe don't buy the sophistication that we have to offer there. So that scenario we are not as good as we would have thought. Charles D. Brady: All right, wonderful, one more from me then. Any update on the LED market, any acceleration kind of investment activity going into that space for you guys? Michael F. Hilton: We haven\u2019t really seen that step up in a big way. As I mentioned last quarter we started to see orders increase in that space from a lighting perspective but nothing that would say hey the way this is hit and I think that\u2019s still where we are at. Charles D. Brady: Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ursaner with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jason Ursaner : Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you. Jason Ursaner : Just following up some of the questions you got for the tech segment. One of the big challenges you talked about in mobile had been the issue of form factor and that there really hasn't been any change with some of the major flagship models for some time. We are obviously seeing a lot written about changes coming in terms of form factor. Do you think that\u2019s driving some of the strength in mobile or is it simply the industry working through the installed capacity for the high speed -- high dispenser and the [inaudible] put in to your supplier? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, I would say a little bit of both. So you know the element that tends to be consistent and steady are sort of components. So things like camera modules, speakers, microphones, gyroscopes, [inaudible] those kinds of things and everybody kind of does that the same way, and tends to use the same set of vendors that we are well positioned. Beyond that it's the sort of features of the phone. So one manufacturer came out last year with the here is an example of the sort of fingerprint sensor. Others are following suit. That is an example of sort of features that tend to drive new applications. So I would say what we are starting to see here is kind of work through maybe some sluggishness in the first quarter around the supply versus capacity and then some additional features coming through and still some potential for form factor changes it's not just things like screen size, fitness is also something that plays a part here and helps with the level of sophisticated needing -- certification needed. Jason Ursaner : Okay. I appreciate that commentary. And then margin in adhesives, it\u2019s back to 27% just I guess when you know at the polymer and plastics businesses are those starting to pull up closer to kind of segment average and how big a gap do you see still relative to the traditional core packaging in adhesive dispensing modules? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, they are improving but not where we need them to be at this point. As we said that it is going to take us a while three to five years to get to that sort of mid-20s kind of margin and we are on that path and the big item that we need obviously is more robust revenue to start in the short-term, are starting to see that improve. I think when the biax piece comes out, comes back we will see that improved significantly. We have got good improvement from continuous improvement standpoint but there are some things around supply chain optimization that will take a little bit longer-term to optimize. So I think we are on the right path but we are not where we need to be yet. Jason Ursaner : Okay, and is incremental margin on kind of the overall business for polymers is that good enough to kind you get there or you really need biax yield to start coming back, is that higher margin part of it? Michael F. Hilton: No, so, the incremental margin is good in that business like it is in all of the businesses. We just need the revenue to come back at reasonable levels and it\u2019s not where we anticipated and quite frankly as we mentioned last year it fell off instead of moving up because of the biax piece. And today it\u2019s just the leverage, the volume leverage that you typically get on the infrastructure combined with what we are doing from a continued improvement standpoint, a lot of which, a lot of the benefits of which we\u2019ll see when the volumes comes back through. So you will see incremental margins improve as a result of that -- on that incremental volume. So it's sort of a double whammy there as the volume come back. In the short-term you don\u2019t see some of the improvements that we have made because the volume has not been as strong as we\u2019d like. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And just last question for me. Looking at the part sales how high a market share of the aftermarket spend of your customers do you think you are capturing? Obviously I know you guys are doing a good job there but just wondering is there sort of a big opportunity to increase share, not necessarily in H2 but next year and beyond in addition to just natural growth on the installed base? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, so, I think we have said in the past we don\u2019t have a 100% of the aftermarket parts for the business, particularly because we have got a huge installed base out there and many of the items have been out there for a long time and so part of our focus from a technology standpoint has been to upgrade the technology and retrofit and the retrofit can take a number of approaches. So we talked in the past about things like our many blue and [surbeat] dispense offerings in adhesives which are relatively simple upgrades for customers that give them more efficient use in the adhesive dispense but also the potential for friction bat. There is more extensive things that from an upgrade standpoint which will be things like the new Liberty product line or the new Freedom product line that's an example in adhesives. So I would say there is opportunity there we're focused on that. It's not like we've got a huge opportunity in the short term there but we think it's a nice complement. And we're trying to reintroduce where we can on these older systems, proprietary technology that give our customers the performance benefit but also have intellectual property protection as well as challenges in the manufacturing that limit the ability to copy. Jason Ursaner : Okay, great. Appreciate all that, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Global Hunter. Your line is open. Walter S. Liptak: Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone and nice quarter. Michael F. Hilton: Thanks Walt. Walter S. Liptak: I think you started answering this question or maybe I just didn't get it but the -- just the trend in orders throughout the quarter your orders are up 9% but your revenue guidance is a little bit higher than that, was your exit rate for orders stronger as the end of the quarter? Michael F. Hilton: It certainly picked up. If you look at sort of our normal pattern I would say it's inline in general with our normal pattern which tends to grow from sort of the late January standpoint and continues to grow to peak sometime in the third or may be early fourth quarter. So we saw it mirror the trend. I would say in a couple of areas and particularly the mobile space we saw more of the orders come in towards the tail end of the quarter. And I think as we said last quarter we weren't sure how much would come through in the second quarter versus the third quarter and we saw orders step up significantly there. So certainly in that space it was towards the tail end and the rest I would say followed pretty closely our normal pattern. Walter S. Liptak: Okay, I guess what I am trying to get to and may be everybody else is too is just the orders have been pretty choppy for the last year. We saw a pick up and then they slowed again. And so is this something where we think that kind of a lot of your end markets are beginning to improve and the regions are improving. We get to more sustainable less volatile order trends. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah and I would say if you look at it there is not necessarily a common theme across each business and each region and so some of the volatility that we've seen is a function of one particular business or one particular region. And the good news when you aggregate it all up it's generally less volatile than if we were focused just on one segment and one region. But I think part of it comes back to what you see from a macro-economic perspective. I think we've always said that we'll outperform the macro economy but we're not immune to it. So we kind of float on top of that, and I think if you look at the last couple of years you have seen a lot of variability in the macro economy and in the macro -- kind of relative to expectations. And even this year as you look to where we are right now you will hear two pieces of good news and one piece of bad news. Everybody expects the second half of the year to be stronger than what we've seen so far in the first half of the year but the most recent data in the major areas around the globe has not been particularly strong. So I think where that impacts us the most we talked about a little bit earlier here is in the bigger investments to bigger systems orders, the things that are more construction and consumer durable related where people step back when they see this kind of uncertainty. So we can have I think to sum it up hopefully it's just a function of what's going on in the global economy right now. Walter S. Liptak: Okay. Michael F. Hilton: And I would say in each of our businesses the markets are a little bit different. So last year the consumer non-durable part and our adhesives business the overall consumption in that marketplace was pretty weak. And this year it's improved nicely and we're seeing the benefit of that. We're very well positioned everywhere to take advantage of it when we ought. Walter S. Liptak: Okay, great thanks for the answer, and along those lines you mentioned again that the polymers business should get a pick-up in the fourth quarter. Was it your fiscal quarter or the December year and why was that -- why is that expected to pick up then? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So I would say we are seeing some improvements in orders now based on introducing new technology based on building out facilities in emerging markets. So we\u2019ve got enhanced capability and lead time. What we are particularly referring to is the biggest impact on that business as in what they call it biaxially oriented film and so think about that as the multi-layer film that is used in all of these plastic packages that you see in the grocery store for everything from drink through detergents and motor oil. And that\u2019s an area where there were substantial investment in 2011 and 2012, I think based on a projection of a more robust economy at that time globally and there we shot the mark. And we really expect to see that business be strong in the next couple of years. We\u2019ll start to see some orders this year. And we are basing that on what we are hearing from the OEM channel which tends to give us some insight into orders that would come to us based on projects that they are starting to work on. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s given us some encouragement. Overall consumption on the plastic side has remained in sort of the 5%, 6% even in the up and down short term macro environment and the projections from the folks in the industry that follow this are for pretty robust 15% and 16%. And so that\u2019s why we are making the commentary and I\u2019d say our customer base would support that. Walter S. Liptak: Okay got it. Okay thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Gregory Halter : Thank you and good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. Gregory Halter : I wondered if you could discuss the current M&A environment and what you guys may be looking at there, if it\u2019s more focused on the dividend and the share repurchase, or if you are still looking for additional companies? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So I would say we always want to have a robust pipeline and we do. And I would say we have a goal to have a significant amount of that activity be proprietary and we are working on a number of things that fall into that category. As we said through the last quarter and coming into the year we kind of expected this year to be a year focused on completing the integration of the latest acquisitions, delivering on the synergies, getting ourselves positioned to take advantage of this growth we expect coming back as I just mentioned in the plastics space, and that we would probably looking at more sort of bolt-on kinds of things like we did with the product line addition in the medical space left towards the tail end of last year. But we have a robust pipeline. So from a priority standpoint in the near term it's more likely to be share repurchase which we talked about in this quarter and we indicated last quarter that we expected to this year to be largely through our Board commitment which was around $200 million and so I think we still have about a $140 million left on that but we are active through the whole quarter in the second quarter. And then we have a strong dividend policy. We\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we like to get that payout ratio up into the low to mid 20s and we are probably hovering around the high teens and so we except going forward to continue to see strong dividend increases like we\u2019ve done the last three years. So I\u2019d say the priority in the short term is probably more around obviously number one to support our organic growth of our business but it\u2019ll be more around probably the share repurchase of dividend and the M&A activity is likely to be more bolt-ons in the short term. Gregory Halter : All right. And of that $53 million spent on the repurchase, how many shares were bought and what\u2019s the -- do you have the share count at the end of the quarter? Michael F. Hilton: The share repurchase activity I believe was about 700,000, and in terms of the share count at the end of the quarter we\u2019ve got average shares and common share equivalents at the end of the second quarter of just under of about $64.5 million and that compares to close to $65 million at the end of the second quarter of the prior year. Gregory Halter : All right. Then relative to the four larger acquisitions, Kreyenborg Xaloy, EDi and Value Plastics I wonder if you could run through each of those in regards to where you think you are in the integration of those companies? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, so, if you look at Value Plastics is done and we are running that in accordance with the strategy that we developed to round the product line, globalize the business, add some tuck-ins to it and as we mentioned earlier we need to expand capacity to support the growth in that business. In the sort of polymer processing or plastics area we in a sort of period of 18 months we made four significant acquisitions, the latest of which was the Kreyenborg BKG acquisition and I would say we are through all of the critical sort of integration steps from a back office standpoint from a run the business standpoint to make them part of Nordson. I\u2019d say we still, as we talked about in the past, there is some things that are longer term. So optimizing our sales channels, we prefer to go direct as much as we can. Some of those companies had direct in certain places and agents or distributors in others and we are going through a thoughtful process of doing that. We also want to optimize the total offerings that we have now across that full melt stream concept and that take some time because we have to cross train or align engineering organizations, things like that. And then on the supply chain, optimizing supply chain I think we are making good progress on things like our sourcing initiatives. But there is other things that we need to do further optimize that and it will take some time as well. So I\u2019d say we are good with all the sort of critical run the business kind of activities and done with the formal integration with the latest acquisition and eventually moving that total capability to the vision that we had when we made these four acquisitions and that\u2019s a multi-year activity that we have talked about in the past. Gregory Halter : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open. Liam D. Burke: Thank you. Good morning Mike, good morning Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Liam. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Liam D. Burke: Mike can you give us a profit profile of both as you introduce -- as the Freedom and Liberty products ramp-up do you anticipate having profit margins similar to what the traditional adhesive products were? Michael F. Hilton: We do. I think our overall strategy as we have talked about in that business is continue to be the technology leader to introduce the latest, greatest best capability and to price that in a way that we get paid for the capability but at the same time are conscious of the position we have in the industry. So yes we would expect those products to be equally profitable or maybe a little more profitable than our current product line based on the fact that they are newest greatest technology with the most to offer. Liam D. Burke: Okay, and on staying with adhesives the numbers are strong on the revenue side, orders were healthy. Are you seeing any change in the competitive front there? Michael F. Hilton: No, not really. I mean we have got good competitors in that space and I think as you know it kind of varies, the packaging's a little bit different than nonwovens, a little bit different in product assembly, and it varies by geography. But we haven\u2019t seen any significant change in the competitive landscape. We have got good competitors and you know our goal is to continue to enhance our business model which means both investing in technology but also trying to be the best out there from applications, sales and support and service offering. I think we do a very good job and our team does a great job of that. So we are conscious that we have got good competitors and we want to stay ahead of them. Liam D. Burke: Great, thank you Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Joseph K. Radigan: Hi, good morning, guys. This is Joe Radigan in for Matt. Michael F. Hilton: Hi, Joe. Joseph K. Radigan: Hi, good morning. Maybe can you give us some more color on what you are seeing in China? You have called out softness there in recent quarters, orders rebounded in Asia Pacific pretty nicely although that was against a weak comp so may be what are your folks on the ground saying there about the tone of project activity and visibility because I know it's been pretty choppy? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah I would say it's not too different than what we been saying in the last couple of quarters. We do see a good activity I\u2019d say in certain businesses. Those things have come through. So we are seeing nice business come through on the adhesives front, particularly in packaging and nonwovens. I\u2019d say with the step up in the mobile thing we\u2019ve seen orders come through on the technology space. I\u2019d say in some of the consumer durable side it's a little softer and I think that\u2019s just a function of trying to understand where the government's going within China what level of support they will provide or won\u2019t provide, the availability of credit. So I still think there is a fair bit of uncertainty there. We have a good robust project list. I think the bigger ticket items are little slower to come through from an investment standpoint but we still expect it to be a solid year in China. I'd say it is choppy still. Joseph K. Radigan: Okay, and then may be one more on the mobile piece of the business in advance tech more of a clarification really. The last product cycle in 2012 you saw very strong double digit order and revenue growth for a couple of quarters. Based on what you talked about and seeing this pick up of momentum here very recently, could you see a similar type of ramp based on that? Or is this more of a steady improvement given some of the saturation and other stuff you talked about? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah I would say in the longer term it's more a steady improvement. I\u2019d say it's seems like we are sort of getting orders concentrated into a more narrow period of time then maybe we have in the past. So it may be that these sort of cycles are when product offerings are coming out are coinciding a little bit more. But I\u2019d say it's more of a steady improvement along the lines of the comments that I made earlier around what we see as long term trends. But it does appear to get more concentrated from an order perspective in terms of timing within a year. Joseph K. Radigan: Okay. Thanks Mike, I appreciate it. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Mark Douglass : Hi good morning, gentlemen. Michael F. Hilton: Morning Mark. Mark Douglass : Can you discuss the dilutive impact of Kreyenborg EDS margins, just give better idea of how the legacy business was doing year-over-year on the incremental margins? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, I\u2019d say overall what we said is most of the businesses that we brought in that space had sort of mid-teen or so EBITDA margins and we really needed to get those to sort of operating margins in mid-20\u2019s and that was going to take some time. And I think Kreyenborg is in a similar place. They are having a good year. We are ahead of where we thought we would be when we brought them. So that\u2019s certainly encouraging. But we have the opportunity over time to improve them just in a way that we have with other businesses by introducing the things that we are good and have continuous improvement. Some of the discipline around the marketing and product management and pricing, and then really using them as a nice fit in the portfolio in terms of product capability to leverage the melt stream piece. So end of the day they have the impact like the other businesses did and over time our goal is to get them to that sort of mid-20 sort of corporate average as we go forward. Mark Douglass : Okay, and in tech, why the restructuring charge in tech? What are you doing there? And you invested more in tech last year. Michael F. Hilton: We did and in different places, okay. So what we are really trying to do is a couple of things. So respond to the cycles more quickly and figure out how to do that in a better way. And two as we optimize our overall global footprint in terms of building up places like Suzhou to support sort of the tier restructure there we need to look at our global organization and optimize where we have resources and capability and so that\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve been doing. Mark Douglass : And then finally in the tech ecosystem I could see good growth in your test platform and plasma that looks like it's pretty stable for a while, should be pretty firm for multiple quarters? Michael F. Hilton: I would say the test piece has come back particularly as we talked about last time with bond test as a good indicator, that continues to be solid and [extra inspection] we are in a good position in terms of the capability that we have there. So our expectation is for that business to be solid. We haven't yet seen a big step up in some of the more traditional applications although some of the things that we're seeing in the test side would give us some encouragement to that. So we're hopeful that's going to continue to improve. There are some new applications on the surface treatment that we're engaged and that are helping drive that and we've got a nice set of product offerings there that support that. Mark Douglass : Okay, thank you. Michael F. Hilton: Amanda we have time maybe for one last question. Operator : I am showing we have a follow up question from the line of John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. John Franzreb : Yeah just in industrial coatings we haven't touched on much. It seems to me that the margin profile was substantially stronger than a year ago at similar revenue levels. Is there something in a mix or structurally different that drove that margin gains year-over-year? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah Charlie this is Greg there was -- I am sorry John. This is Greg. There was -- it is a mix story within industrial coating, not particularly significant difference in parts versus systems but the types of systems were more of a standard system if you will than a fully engineered system. So product mix was a big driver there. But I would say as we continue to improve the profitability of the business so we've got a very robust effort in the many fronts in that business and we've made really good progress today but our goal is for further improvement there. John Franzreb : Great guys, thanks for the color. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. James R. Jaye: So that's going to wrap up our Q&A period for now. This is Jim, I'll be around the rest of the day if you want to email me or call me we can get some time together if you have follow-ups. Thanks for listening in and everyone have a good holiday weekend. Thank you. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Nicole and good morning. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. I am here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We would like to welcome you to our conference call today, Friday, August 22, 2014 on Nordson\u2019s third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at www.nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until August 29, 2014 by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 82465633. During this conference call, forward-looking statements maybe made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our fiscal 2014 third quarter results and a bit about our fourth quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone and thank you for attending Nordson\u2019s 2014 third quarter conference call. Our performance in the third quarter was very good as Nordson\u2019s global team delivered the strongest quarterly performance in revenue, operating profit and earnings per share in our history. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the continued softness in the macroeconomic environment. The global team is focused on meeting the needs of our customers with innovative products, applications expertise and global support, while also executing on a variety of strategic initiatives and continuous improvement projects to just drive sustained long-term success. I am especially pleased with the robust organic sales volume growth of 8% generated in the quarter as compared to the same period a year ago. All segments and geographies contributed to this growth and we leveraged the strong top line growth to deliver operating margin of 25% in the third quarter, a 2 percentage point improvement over the previous year\u2019s third quarter. With this leverage, the earnings per share grew at a faster rate than top line improving 20% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong and from a balance sheet perspective, we remained very liquid with significant capacity for appropriate capital deployment. We continued to create value for our shareholders through our balanced approach to capital deployment investing $36 million during the third quarter for the repurchase of shares and by distributing approximately $11 million in dividends during the quarter. After the close of the quarter, Nordson\u2019s Board approved a 22% increase to our dividend as we moved toward a payout ratio nearing 20% marking the 51st consecutive year we have increased our annual dividend. I am also pleased to report that we continued to execute on our acquisition strategy with the purchase of Avalon Laboratories, a high performing company in the medical device space. We welcome Avalon employees to Nordson and will provide additional details on this acquisition later in the call. Looking ahead, our current backlog and order rates are solid leading us to expect continued strong performance in our fourth quarter and a record full year results for sales, operating profits and earnings per share. I will share additional comments about our current business trends and our near-term outlook momentarily, but first, I will turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer who will provide more detailed commentary on our third quarter financial results and our fourth quarter guidance. Greg? Greg Thaxton : Thank you and good morning to everyone. Sales in the third quarter were $459 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year third quarter. This sales improvement included an 8% increase in organic volume, a 5% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions and a 1% increase related to the favorable effects of currency translation. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume increased 15% as compared to the prior year third quarter. Organic growth was 5% and the first year effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition added growth of 10%. The organic growth was driven by disposable hygiene rigid packaging and polymer processing end markets and we saw growth in every region. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 15% over the prior year third quarter. Strong organic growth in all product lines during the quarter was led by demand for automated dispensing equipment as well as continued solid demand for our test and inspection and surface treatment equipment related to electronic mobile device end markets. Growth was also robust in our semi-automated dispensing systems and single-use fluid management components related to medical and industrial end markets. Geographically, organic sales growth in Japan, Asia-Pacific and the Americas was offset by softness in the U.S. and Europe. The Industrial Coating Systems segment sales volume increased less than 1% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Solid growth in the U.S. and Europe led by cold material dispensing equipment for automotive and industrial end markets was offset by softness in other regions and in selected consumer durable goods end markets. On a total company basis, gross margin in the third quarter was 56% equal to the level delivered in the prior year despite a higher mix of systems revenue in the current quarter. Operating profit in the third quarter was $114 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year and operating margin was 25%, as Mike mentioned, an improvement of 2 percentage points over the prior year. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 27% in the current quarter, an improvement of 1 percentage point over the same period a year ago. Within the Advanced Technology segment, operating margin was 32% in the third quarter, an improvement of 4 percentage points as compared to the third quarter a year ago and reflective of our ability to leverage margin with increased sales volume. With this segment\u2019s typical seasonality pattern, we do expect to see a moderation in sales in the fourth quarter. In the Industrial Coatings segment, operating margin was 13% in the third quarter, a solid level for this segment given the quarter\u2019s level of revenue and product mix. Continuing down the income statement, net income for the quarter was $78 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.21, an increase of 20% over last year\u2019s third quarter. The current quarter\u2019s earnings per share included a $0.01 one-time gain related to discrete tax items recognized in the quarter. As in previous quarters, we have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one-time items. On a normalized basis that is to exclude one-time items in both years, third quarter earnings per share increased 21% over the prior year\u2019s third quarter. The current quarter\u2019s EBITDA was $129 million, up 18% as compared to the same period a year ago. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $81 million and free cash flow before dividends was $70 million. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. Mike previously commented on our focus during the quarter of returning value directly to shareholders with our share repurchase activity and dividends. We have approximately $104 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of the third quarter and do expect to remain active in the market as the year progresses, although we do use a pricing grid within a 10b5 repurchase program, whereby we will not repurchase shares over a certain share price. From the balance sheet perspective, we remained very liquid with net debt to EBITDA at 1.42 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of our third quarter and we have approximately $287 million available from cash and our current revolving credit facility. Shortly after the end of our third quarter, we announced and closed a transaction to acquire Avalon Laboratories, a leading designer and manufacturer of highly specialized catheters and medical tubing products for cardiology, pulmonology and related applications. Avalon is a high-performing growth company with best-in-class products that are highly complementary to Nordson\u2019s existing line of highly engineered single use plastic components for fluid management and medical applications. The company has generated double-digit compound annual growth rates in revenue and EBITDA since 2008 through a combination of innovative products, unique process know-how, strong customer relations and scalable low-cost manufacturing. Working capital requirements are modest and CapEx is similar to Nordson\u2019s at about 2% to 3% of annual revenue. We expect to build on the current strong performance of Avalon by leveraging Nordson\u2019s scale, global footprint and continuous improvement competencies. Avalon\u2019s revenue forecast for the 12 months ending October 31, 2014 is $34 million. Revenues are mainly within the U.S. with the current customer base consisting of blue-chip medical device OEMs. The $180 million purchase price represents an EBITDA multiple of 11 times based on management\u2019s forecasted EBITDA for the current calendar year, which is at this time on track. The purchase was funded with short-term borrowing in our existing revolving credit facility. The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to our fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings by about $0.01 inclusive of a $0.02 short-term purchase accounting charge related to the step up in value of acquired inventory. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to fiscal year 2015 results by $0.06 to $0.08 based on preliminary purchase accounting assumptions. Avalon results will be reported within the Advanced Technology systems segment. I will now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter. As we typically do, we have provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with the Kreyenborg and Avalon acquisitions, included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending August 17, 2014, order rates are up 4% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Throughout most of the weeks within this latest fiscal quarter, order rates for the total company were up double-digits as compared to the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, order rates are flat over the last 12 weeks as compared to the same period in the prior year, where strength in rigid packaging and disposable hygiene end markets was offset by negative year-to-year comparisons in the remaining product lines. Orders within the adhesive segment had been up mid to high single-digits as compared to the prior year throughout the third quarter. In the Advanced Technologies segment, order rates over the latest 12 weeks are up 4% compared to the same period in the prior year, where solid growth in test and inspection, surface treatment and medical device product lines were offset by negative year-to-year comparisons in dispensing product lines serving electronics and general, industrial end markets. Order rates within Advanced Technologies segment were up high double-digits throughout each week of the quarter until this most recent week. Within the Industrial Coatings segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 18% as compared to the prior year period. This order growth was driven by strong demand within the cold materials dispensing product lines serving automotive and in general, industrial end markets, with the container coating and powder coating product lines also contributing to the 12-week order growth. Backlog at July 31, 2014 was approximately $266 million, an increase of 36% compared to July 31, 2013 and inclusive of 25% organic growth and 11% growth due to the Kreyenborg acquisition. Backlog at July 31, 2014 increased 9% compared to April 30, 2014, the end of our second fiscal quarter. Backlog amounts are calculated at July 31, 2014 exchange rates. The Avalon acquisition occurred after July 31, the reported backlog amounts do not include any Avalon backlog. Let me now turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. We are forecasting sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 14% as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of 7% to 11% and 3% growth from the first year effect of the Kreyenborg and Avalon acquisitions. Currency translation is not expected to be material compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. At the midpoint of our revenue forecast, we expect fourth quarter gross margin to be between 55% and 56% and operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 23% or 24% excluding short-term purchase accounting charges related to the step up in value of inventory acquired from the Avalon acquisition. We are estimating fourth quarter interest expense of about $3.9 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30.5% resulting in fourth quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.07 per share to $1.17 per share, again inclusive of a $0.02 per share charge related to the step up in value of acquired inventory. The midpoint of this range for diluted earnings per share represents an increase of 22% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter or 23% excluding non-recurring items in both years. We are estimating full year capital expenditures to be approximately $45 million, including investment related to our previously announced facility in Colorado supporting our fluid management product lines. In summary, our global team delivered excellent third quarter results and our outlook is for strong performance in the fourth quarter as well. With that, I will turn the call back over to you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I would like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. Again, I am very pleased with the ongoing efforts of our global team. They are executing at a high level and meeting the needs of our customers better than our competitors. At the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we are expecting organic sales volume growth of 9% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, a very strong level given the macroeconomic environment that is yet to gain full momentum. We expect to leverage this growth to deliver improvement in operating margin and in earnings per share as compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Overall, we are on pace for a record full year performance in sales, operating profit, net income and diluted earnings per share. In addition to our positive near-term view, we are also getting the job done on a variety of strategic initiatives that will drive value over the long-term. In terms of acquisitions, Avalon is a great strategic fit to our medical platform. And again, I would like to welcome the Avalon employees to the Nordson team. We also continue to evaluate a number of other opportunities in our pipeline that may fit our strategic goals although we remain diligent in our acquisition process. We are also excited about the next phase of our continuous improvement efforts with the informal internal launch of what we are calling the Nordson Business System. The Nordson Business System is our collective set of tools and best practices that can help improve our performance in every area of Nordson. Rooted in Lean Six Sigma and supported by our company values, the Nordson Business System touches all areas of the company, including all business units and corporate functions. We have been using many of the tools within the business system for several years and we will continue to add them \u2013 add to them in the future. Overall, our future is bright and we are focused on getting better everyday. We expect to continue leveraging our best-in-class technology, applications expertise, global support and operational excellence across a variety of diverse growth markets to create sustained shareholder value. At this time, let\u2019s turn to your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Allison. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Just going back on the order comments, solid orders this quarter, it sounded like there is a little bit of falloff in Q4. Are you guys seeing any changes in sort of customer or end market dynamics driving that or is it more seasonal? Mike Hilton : It\u2019s more in line with our seasonal pattern if I think you understand that our orders tend to peak in the third quarter and build up from the second quarter through sort of end and early part of the third quarter and then drop off as we approach sort of the end of the year in the holiday season. So, we have seen that sort of same pattern this year. I\u2019d say this year is maybe a little slower start just given kind of the global dynamic at the beginning of the year and the winter here in the U.S., but then we have really strong third quarter across all of our businesses, very high rates sustained throughout the quarter. And then we are starting to see the sort of natural decline. Greg made some comments that kind of relate to how the orders come in. So, in this particular third quarter, we had across a couple of businesses some large orders in the quarter that drop off in this last week. And so it sort of understates what we are seeing in terms of the health of the business at this point. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. And then just going back to sort of your acquisition comments, it sounds like your pipeline\u2019s full, we have had a nice acquisition with Avalon. Can you maybe talk about the environment? Multiple for Avalon seems fairly reasonable just given the margins in that business? Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say as we said throughout this year, our focus was on sort of integration and digesting, but there would be some smaller tuck-ins and potentially adds to our key areas like Avalon. I would say we are \u2013 in our pipeline going forward, we still see a number of sort of those tuck-in type of opportunities. I would say the market is pretty robust and the pricing is also pretty robust just given the fact that many people have cash and the opportunity to finance at low rate, but we think this was a good multiple for the kind of quality business that we have in the growth prospects in the business and the fit with our portfolio. So, I think it was a fair price for this business and we are really excited about the \u2013 not only the growth prospects, but the team coming with us as part of this acquisition. Allison Poliniak : Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Glynn : Just wondering on an update on with respect to the polymer processing platform, the integration progress and if you think it\u2019s returning to sustainable growth at this point or if it\u2019s little early to call that? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, we had a solid quarter in the polymer processing business this quarter. I would say across the different components of the business, some are performing little better than others, I would say the area that was most stressed that we have talked about has been in the dye area. And while that\u2019s improving, it\u2019s still \u2013 we still really haven\u2019t seen that biax piece come back. In talking with the OEMs, they are encouraged that we are going to see some pickup, but I would say we have not seen progress on that front, where we have seen progress on some of the other newer product lines that we talked about in that area. So, I would say, no, we are not seeing the robust return of the biax piece yet, but we are filling in other market opportunities for that, and the Kreyenborg and BKG acquisitions that came in last year have been solid. And as it relates to the integration efforts, we are through the integration of the businesses. We still have some of the longer term things that we have talked about like the sales channel optimization to work through and some of the supply chain opportunities, but in terms of cross-selling opportunities and picking up additional sort of broader scope full product line sales, we are seeing some encouraging progress there, but the underlying sort of biax market has not come back. And some of that is a reflection I think of what\u2019s going on macroly, particularly in Europe and to some extent in parts of Asia. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks for that. And then on ADS orders flat there, we did note relatively tough orders comparisons for the 3Q the past couple of years, so does it feel like that\u2019s a specific comparison thing or that market kind of flattening out after four consecutive periods of pretty good orders growth? Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t read any significant concern into that. I would say it varies a little bit region-by-region, but we have had sort of a strong year in our packaging business and improving year in our non-wovens business and a pretty solid year in product assembly, and you can have impacts quarter to quarter based on sort of the order dynamic I was talking about thoroughly. And we have seen a little bit of that in the adhesives area, but when we look at sort of overall prospects around the globe, we feel pretty good about where we are in that business and we think the business will have a very good year. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Charlie Brady : Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Charlie. Charlie Brady : Hey, just with respect to advanced tech and the margins there, obviously pretty good margins, really, really strong incrementals. With the impact of the commentary in the release about the automated dispensing in the single-use fluid systems, those tend to be fairly high margin product. Did that mix have a \u2013 was that skewing kind of the margin there and you think you expect going forward into Q4 the same type of incremental margin? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, Charlie, in that business, we talked earlier in the year when things were sort of going the other way about the sort of volume leverage in that business and how we try and move our structure up and down to accommodate it. But I think what you are seeing here is good order growth, and the volume leverage really is coming from that good order growth and it\u2019s quality mix of products, but it\u2019s really around the volume leverage that we are seeing and we would expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit lower in part, because we see the orders naturally seasonally drop off and so the revenue was likely sequentially to be down a little bit, and so you will see a little bit negative leverage there from a volume perspective, but I would say the quality of the business has been good across all of the product lines. And as we have talked earlier in the year, we have had a particularly solid year in our test and inspection business and the expense piece has come along starting in second quarter continuing this quarter and into the fourth quarter, so after a slow start, a pretty good year. Charlie Brady : Okay. And then on advanced \u2013 I am sorry, adhesive dispensing just try to understand the orders in the quarter, was it you said it\u2019s up double-digit most of the quarter, was it a slow start or a slow ending that skewed it to flat for the period you gave? Mike Hilton : It\u2019s really been more about the last week or so. And as orders come in, we had some large orders that fell off from sort of the first week of that 12-week period. And so it skewed it a little bit. So, what we are trying to give you is a road feel of a run-rate being pretty strong and we are getting a little bit of a point to point comparison there as well as in the advanced tech side that doesn\u2019t truly reflect the strength of what we saw. I think what you can see is the pretty significant step up in the backlog and that gives us a feel for how solid the orders were in the quarter. Greg Thaxton : Yes, this is Greg. Just to add to that, the comments are intended to suggest that throughout the quarter in both adhesives and advanced technology, the order pace was pretty strong and sometimes it couldn\u2019t get down to what week 13 weeks ago drops off and what week comes in to that 12-week comparison. It can be as simple as the one dropping off and the one coming in that can skew the numbers. So, the comments we are intending to imply that it was a good order pace throughout the quarter and you see that reflected in the backlog as we start the fourth quarter. Charlie Brady : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just on Avalon for a minute, can you talk about maybe some more granularity on that business in terms of the revenues, the margins in that business? Mike Hilton : Yes. In terms of the revenues, I think we suggested that this year\u2019s expected revenues were around $34 million. Well, we didn\u2019t comment on the margins, but you can assume that those are really strong margins consistent with what we see in the other parts of the medical business. So \u2013 and I think if you look at the sort of EBITDA multiple, you get a feel for that, Charlie. Charlie Brady : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ursaner of CJS Securities. Your line is now open. Jason Ursaner : For the Adhesive Dispensing business on the operating margin side, just sort of a follow-up to Chris\u2019 question before, could you quantify the margin of the plastics group at all, just because on the surface, it does still look like a pretty significant drag relative to the old core business? Mike Hilton : Yes. What we have said in the past is most of the margin impact has been the mix of these businesses coming in. And what we have said in the long run is the core businesses should operate, historical business at sort of 30 plus and the polymer business is we need to get up into the 20 plus towards the mid 20s. They are not there right now. They weren\u2019t there when we bought them and the volume has been a little bit weak. So, I would say we are on target with what we see in terms of the improvements overall in the segment. And in the long run, we expect the segment to inch up closer to that 30%, I think is the way to think about it. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And any plans to break it out over time now that it\u2019s getting more of a sizable complete offering? Mike Hilton : No. I mean, if you look at it most of what we are doing has gone into the packaging part of the business and that\u2019s the biggest part of our adhesive segment and we are really trying to leverage the customer elements of that and some of the operating approaches that we have as well. So, it\u2019s a nice complement really with a significant focus in the same markets that we serve out of the adhesive business. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And for Avalon, is that business selling its own product direct or is it a contract manufacturer that would sell through other medical device brands? Mike Hilton : So, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as the contract manufacturer, but no, it\u2019s going through like our dye plastics business, it\u2019s going through the big OEMs that you would recognize on the medical device space. So, it\u2019s not gone directly to end users, we are one step back and really what they are providing is sophisticated components that are used in the applications around cardiovascular and pulmonology. And when you think about it, the trends in that business, include further outsourcing by the OEMs are a big positive in addition to the underlying sort of demographics of the markets. Greg Thaxton : So, Jason, this is Greg. Think about it similar to other Nordson products, it\u2019s highly engineered, performing a critical application and gets incorporated then into a bigger product set. Jason Ursaner : Got it. And do you have the full year sales or EBITDA for 2013 that are going to be the first year effect? Just wondering how much of the $34 million is going to end up showing up is kind of \u2013 or would show up as organic growth? Greg Thaxton : Yes. Well, what we gave \u2013 what we provided was the forecast through what would coincide with our fiscal year end which is about $34 million in revenue. Jason Ursaner : Right. But I guess, if I look at the 2.5 months in guidance for the first year effect, if I take out a month of Kreyenborg, it looks like it\u2019s on significantly different run rate. So, I am \u2013 guess I am trying to wonder how much that business is growing, I mean it looks like it\u2019s 25% to 30% growth this year? Greg Thaxton : Yes. What we incorporated in our guidance for the quarter was their historical revenue in this fourth quarter \u2013 in aligning with our fiscal fourth quarter. Mike Hilton : So, in long run though we think that, I think Greg mentioned over the last five years, it\u2019s grown nicely at double-digit rate. So, we expect it to continue to grow at that rates because of the applications that it plays into and this outsourcing phenomenon that we talked about. So, like our other medical businesses that have been growing at nicely double-digits over the last three years or so, we think this is a nice fit and complement with similar growth characteristics. Jason Ursaner : Okay. Greg Thaxton : So that Avalon plus the partial period of the Kreyenborg in the prior year that we didn\u2019t note them contribute to that full 3% acquisitive growth. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And long-term, just what do you see is the kind of total addressable size of that market? Greg Thaxton : Are you talking about the space for our medical space or Avalon specifically? Jason Ursaner : I guess the spring reinforced catheters? Greg Thaxton : Yes. So, that\u2019s in the hundreds of millions of dollar opportunity we see in the long run in that space. Mike Hilton : And that\u2019s differentiated from what would be the more commodity tubing. Greg Thaxton : That\u2019s not a part that they play in or we have any interest in. This is all really highly engineered specialty tubing multiple ports reinforced electrical connections and so forth. It\u2019s a very sophisticated approach to providing a particular set of requirements for some of the areas that we have talked about, the surgical areas in particular. Jason Ursaner : Okay. And is there just last question for me, sorry, is there any concern of 3D printing as a competitor to the single piece construction versus the casting that you guys have? Greg Thaxton : I would say not at this point in time given the level of sophistication of the devices and the multiple materials here down the road. We are always looking for new opportunities for the business. So, 3D printing could play a role in a number of things that we do, but right now, I would say we don\u2019t see that as any immediate concern. We actually think the unique technology that Avalon has and the benefits that come with it will allow to grow disproportionately. Jason Ursaner : Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Global Hunter. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Walter Liptak : Good morning. I wanted to go back to advanced tech and I guess the question is on new product launches, where are we in the launch cycle. It seems like we keep hearing everyday about new mobile devices getting launched and some of those are pretty large launches. Is the ordering for your products something that\u2019s already passed in some of these and we will see some seasonal weakness or is there a pipeline of awards that you can see over the next three to six months? Mike Hilton : I would say we will continue to see the seasonal pattern that we typically see in that business. I mean, some of it is just the nature of our, if you look at our year in the holiday period and so forth as it relates to the first quarter, but lot of it as it relates to the sort of mobile space, it\u2019s time to launch as that tend to come out in the late second through early fourth quarter period of time. And so we will see that kind of pattern I think continue unless the timing on some of these launches change. One of the things that we did mentioned in the last call is that we are continuing to look at some of the up and coming new device providers, particularly in China and then this quarter we have got our first orders with a couple of the Chinese manufacturers that are looking to move aggressively into the smartphone technology. And then there is also potential down the road which was not clear as to how accepted this will be in the marketplace is the whole wearable technology. I would say to-date it\u2019s been a little bit hit and miss, but some people are optimistic about the potential for that down the road and that depending on how that would play out that could skew some things in terms of when the various customers would launch that. So, I think we will continue to see the sort of second quarter to early fourth quarter kind of period of high intensity and it can move fluctuate year-to-year and we typically will see the seasonal patterns that we are starting to see now where things wind down as we get to year end. Walter Liptak : Okay, that sounds great. Going back to some of the first award and some of these other potential out there, what do you \u2013 can you help us size what those opportunities are like and if you have any initial wins here? Mike Hilton : We have had a few initial wins, I would say in our tiered offering of our automated platform and also in sort of our semi-automated platform. I think the challenge as we have talked about in the past is to what degree will these folks go to automation and how sophisticated they will be in the automation approach? And then from a process standpoint, to what degree will they do things that relate to mechanical integrity and moisture production and things like that not clear yet. Lot of these folks obviously are aimed at a different price point and it\u2019s not clear what the ultimate quality is going to be, I would say in the near-term. In the long-term, I think it\u2019s going to be globally, they are going to need to be globally competitive and particularly if they look to try and export out of China. So, I would say, it\u2019s for us it\u2019s too early to tell our approach has been \u2013 we have a pretty good handle on who we think is going to make progress and be successful. We have teams involved working those accounts. We have got our first orders in, which is encouraging but it\u2019s a little hard to size the opportunity at this point in time given those factors that I mentioned. Walter Liptak : Okay, got it. Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Halter of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Greg Halter : Thank you and good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Greg. Greg Halter : Couple of cleanup items, can you provide the number of shares that were purchased in the quarter and also if you are having what the payables figure is? Mike Hilton : Yes. The number of shares purchased in the quarter was about 470,000 shares comprising that 36 million. I will add on a year-to-date basis, we have bought about 1.2 million shares, so about 2% of outstanding shares. And in total, on that 1.2 million that\u2019s at a average share price of about $73.35. Your comment on payables? Greg Halter : Yes, if you have that figure. Mike Hilton : You are talking about notes payable? Greg Halter : Accounts payable, sorry. Mike Hilton : Yes, it\u2019s about $20 million including our short-term debt. Greg Halter : Okay. And on the competition front, have you noticed any of your competitors becoming more or less so recently? Mike Hilton : I would say across all the businesses, no significant change in the competitive intensity. As we have talked about in the past, we have got good competitors in each of our businesses, but we haven\u2019t seen any changes of significance one way or another there. I think our approach is what it\u2019s always been is to continue to leverage our business model, which starts with offering the best technology and the best customer experience in terms of support and service and applications know-how. So, we think we are doing a good job. We think we are winning in the marketplace, but I would say the competitive intensity remains basically unchanged. It\u2019s competitive. Greg Halter : Okay. Mike Hilton : And Greg, just let me clarify, the $20 million is notes payable and debt due, is that the number or you are looking for accounts payable? Greg Halter : Accounts payable, accounts payable. Mike Hilton : Okay. And accounts payable and other liabilities was about $240 million that those numbers are on the financial exhibit in the press release. Greg Halter : Okay, alright. And relative to Avalon, you made a comment that their business is mainly in the U.S., is there any restriction for that to go international and if not why have they not done so and is that your plan going forward? Mike Hilton : I would say, there is no restrictions on going outside of the U.S. I think they focused on significant opportunities in the U.S. and in many of these procedures, the U.S. is more advanced than other countries, but we have been moving our business in our other medical applications overseas and so our plan will be over time to expand the business, but we have got lot of opportunities still here in the U.S. Obviously, the next likely target would be Europe and that\u2019s what we have done with our other medical businesses, I think Asia is a little bit more fragmented and in some areas little bit further behind. Greg Halter : Okay. And looking at the geographic orders obviously some of the areas are very bumpy, lumpy whatever, but Japan being up 39% and 15% the prior quarter, can you talk to the strength there, what\u2019s going on there in Japan? Mike Hilton : I would say there is good progress across most of the businesses. I would say earlier in the year it was maybe a little softer and that\u2019s it\u2019s picked up across all businesses. I would say if you think about things like the mobile business, a lot of the components that go in there, get made in Japan, so that\u2019s not so surprising. I would say, the strength in some of our sort of more consumer durable businesses is a little surprising to-date, but we are seeing good progress there, probably a little bit more robust than we would have expected, I\u2019d say coming into the year. Greg Thaxton : Yes, this is Greg. I would just add as Mike mentioned it, it was good solid growth rates across each of the segment and that\u2019s even against a trend where Japanese manufacturers are offshoring production to other low cost countries. So, very good growth rates within Japan for our product lines. Mike Hilton : I think that speaks to the strength of our customer base and the business model there and the execution on the team as the opportunities come up, but I would say we are probably pleasantly surprised that the strength in the last quarter or two. Greg Halter : I hope you keep that up. And one last one I don\u2019t know if you commented on it, but the Freedom product line, just wonder if you could give an update there? Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say the Freedom product line and this now includes what we call Liberty, which is the sort of next year down product in that suite. I would say revenue wise we are pretty much on plan. As I said in the last quarter, unit wise, we are a little bit behind, but pricing based on the value provided was a little bit better and that trend is continuing. And I would say the sort of full value impact of the adhesive material itself has still not come to fruition that\u2019s probably end of the calendar year kind of timeframe for some of the newer adhesives to have sort of the full impact on mileage and so forth. So, I think the combination of both the tiered product and the high end product, we feel pretty good about progress to-date. Greg Halter : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rudy Hokanson of Barrington. Your line is now open. Rudy Hokanson : Your expansion of the facility in Colorado from about 45,000 square feet up to 115,000 square feet and now with the acquisition of Avalon, are there opportunities in terms of managing workflow or production of certain products between the two or will Avalon\u2026. Greg Thaxton : Rudy, you are dropping off throughout your question. So, we didn\u2019t catch your\u2026 Mike Hilton : Let me take a stab at the first part of that and then if I am not quite getting it, you can come back. Yes, the expansion when we talked about the expansion in Colorado, it was primarily driven by our opportunity in the medical space. We also did talk about so the fact that some of the other EFD products that we make and might need some expansion that we could probably delay some of those expansion requirements through this particular facility. And so it\u2019s really based on the growth that we see. I think we have growth opportunities with Avalon as well and naturally with I mean the \u2013 in the mix here and given the manufacturing facilities they have in Mexico, we will look at the total capability not just across the medical platform, but across all of our sort of food management business and look to sort of optimize our supply chain, but we see robust demand in the medical space at least in the niches that we are in today, which is really driving the prime reason for the Colorado expansion. Rudy Hokanson : Okay, thank you. That answers my question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke of Janney Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Liam. Liam Burke : Mike, you talked about the integration of polymers coming along supply chain etcetera, are they \u2013 is the integration along \u2013 further along enough to be able to start applying continuous improvement or as you call it Nordson Business Systems? Mike Hilton : Yes. We are absolutely doing that across the sort of platform of four products \u2013 product lines that we brought in and prioritizing those opportunities. So, yes, we are seeing good progress along the continuous improvement front. I would say, each of the businesses was probably in a different place as it relates to their level of experience with Lean Six Sigma. And so we are trying to bring them all up to the sort of highest level. We are managing the priorities of those projects. I think as we have talked in the past there would be some bigger opportunities as it relates to optimizing the overall supply chain, but that will take us some time to do, because the thought process and planning behind that\u2019s a little different than what we did in the adhesives side of things, but there is still opportunity to come over the next couple of years in that area. And then the full leverage on the selling side and the sales channel management, I would say, we are making good progress, but there is still some opportunity there, but the basics for Lean Six Sigma philosophy, the team is getting up to speed with and we have got folks leading those activities. And it\u2019s really a matter of just prioritizing the biggest hits first and effectively utilizing the organization to get those priority activities done. Liam Burke : And on the medical side, do you see I mean, you have had a great quarter on the advanced tech more cyclical businesses kicked in across the board? Are you seeing the medical business starting to contribute enough, we would anticipate some of \u2013 offsetting some of the cyclical swings we would normally see in advanced tech? Mike Hilton : Yes. So I would say certainly in the, yes, the medical business is done very well the last several years, strong double-digit growth and the broader not just the medical but the broader fluid management piece that goes into non-electronic markets has also had very solid growth. So, yes, we have a focused effort to continue to grow that total area to help balance the cyclicality in the electronics business. And there is a seasonality that we see with throughout the year and then there is the longer term cycle piece with that. So, the seasonality is going to be what it is, but the longer term cycle piece we are trying to offset. So, I would say that whole fluid management piece is contributing to that. Our goal over time is to continue to grow both organically and with add-ons in this medical business to continue to help that balance. Liam Burke : Great. Thank you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Hi, couple of questions. First is with respect to Avalon, it looks like they already have a low-cost manufacturing footprint in Mexico, Mike, are there other cost synergies to be had with this business and can you talk about whether or not existing relationships in the medical space you have will lend itself to revenue synergies. Could you kind of address the whole synergy opportunity there? Mike Hilton : Sure. So I would say the fact that they do have low cost manufacturing provides some opportunities I would say in the near-term, but also from a growth perspective as we look at some of the operations that we do that are more labor-intensive. So, I think there is some opportunities there both near-term and longer term. I would say we are more encouraged on the revenue side, because there are some customers that are sort of direct overlap, where we immediately have a broader product line, but there are other customers that they have and we have whether that opportunity to provide that fuller suite going forward. And as customers move to more and more outsourcing, customers being that sort of OEM channel having a full suite of products and demonstrating that you can meet the technology requirements, the quality control and the traceability requirements and provide the support and service, I think makes sense. And in a market that\u2019s been fragmented as we build the bigger portfolio here, I think that\u2019s attractive as well. So, yes, we anticipate there will be some nice revenue synergies down the road as we are able to offer fluid product line and leverage either of the Avalon client base with the Nordson client base here. Matt Summerville : And can you also just with respect to Avalon, is that subject to direct FDA regulation medical device tax, is any of that involved here? Mike Hilton : Now, we are kind of like one step back like we are with the Value Plastics business, where we supply into that group of key customers that have the FDA requirements. So, we have to provide products that go in and that as the system itself will get certified and a lot of the effort is on the upfront development of the new treatments, therapies, approaches and so it\u2019s very similar in that regard to the Value Plastics piece of business. Matt Summerville : Lastly, just with respect to polymer processing, I think it was on your prepared remarks or in response to a question you mentioned that margins are clearly not where you would like them to be more in the mid 20s is kind of where you are targeting longer term, can you talk about when you acquired this group of businesses collectively, where were margins and where are they actually now and how much of the equation to get from wherever they are to say 25% is predicated upon volume versus cost-oriented synergies if you will? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, on average, they are over sort of in the mid-teens kind of EBITDA, when we acquired them. I would say the dyes business in particular has had softer revenue than expected. And so we have had some negative volume leverage there that\u2019s impacted the business. So, they are blow that collectively now. I think the volume like all of our businesses is certainly the biggest driver, but in this business, we do have an opportunity for significant both productivity improvements and cost synergies as we look at the overall supply chain. As we talked before, that\u2019s not something we can execute in three months, because it\u2019s more complicated than that, but we are already involved with some things that will help move us down the road of getting more efficient there, but like all of our businesses, number one driver is the volume piece. Here I would say we have more than \u2013 more opportunity in our normal business to affect the cost equation. And in the short-term that\u2019s our primary focus. Matt Summerville : Can you just sort of remind maybe what the manufacturing footprint looks like in this business currently and whether or not that is a component of this equation to get that substantial margin improvement off where it is today? Mike Hilton : Sure. We have manufacturing facilities in every region. So, if you look at Asia, we have facilities in Thailand and in China. If you look at Europe, we have facilities in Germany and Belgium. And then in the U.S., we have a number of facilities from Wisconsin to Virginia to Iowa and Pennsylvania and maybe one or two others. So, there are opportunities to optimize the overall approach there going forward. Matt Summerville : Thanks Mike. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Mark Douglass : Hi, good morning gentlemen. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning. Mark Douglass : Just to follow-up on Greg\u2019s question, do you have an estimate for accounts payable ex-accrued liabilities? Mike Hilton : I don\u2019t have that detail, Mark. I can get back to you on that, but again, the sum of those two is about $240 million. Mark Douglass : Right. I see that. Just wondering what the timetable was. Mike Hilton : Yes. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then looking at Avalon, you said 11 times EBITDA that would be equivalent to EBITDA in your fiscal \u201814? Mike Hilton : Right, yes. Mark Douglass : Right, okay. So, looking forward at EBIT or EBITDA, what are you estimating would be additional D&A layered on post-acquisition relative to I mean where it was? Mike Hilton : Yes, Mark. So, we are in the early stages of doing the valuation work. So, we have got our estimates of kind of on a macro basis of what we think those charges would be and that\u2019s incorporated in the $0.06 to $0.08 accretion that we called out for \u201815, but we are not at the point where we have got any of that detail. Mark Douglass : Okay. And looking at Avalon, what kind of cash-on-cash returns do you expect over the next two to three years? Is it going to require much, it doesn\u2019t sound like it, but will it require some investments on your part, what are you shooting for as far as returns? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, in terms of investment, I think it\u2019s an asset-light type of manufacturing like the rest of our businesses. I think Greg said sort of to maintain it going forward you can expect sort of 2% to 3% of revenue in terms of overall sort of maintenance type investment. The \u2013 we have got capacity in the facilities that we have, but we also have opportunities to grow, I think we would expect the trends that we have seen in the past, which are double-digit top line and EBITDA. They would continue in that business. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then final question, looking at ICS, the real strong order growth, is that a factor of easier comps or is it really just you received some really big orders. And if it\u2019s receiving some bigger orders, does that imply that there is some longer term deliveries, so that gives you some backlog even into first quarter \u201815 or will most of this ship in 4Q? Mike Hilton : Yes. And so just on a typical pattern, we would see the sort of the order rates be strong second quarter to early fourth quarter as people kind of spend their capital budgets for the year and that\u2019s kind of what we have seen here, some of this is a little bit comp year-on-year, but very solid order growth there. In terms of deliveries, most of what we can deliver, we deliver in the say maybe up to 8 weeks. So, there could be some that slip over a little bit into the fourth quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an unusual quarter in anyway relative to the mix of what gets delivered in the quarter or not. I would say what you are seeing is people are completing their budget work for the year and have let their orders come and we are seeing that benefit and a little bit of year-on-year comparison, which you always have in this business, because it\u2019s lumpy project-related business. Mark Douglass : Yes, thank you. Jim Jaye : Nicole, we probably have time for maybe one more question. Operator : (Operator Instructions) I am showing no further questions at this time. Jim Jaye : Okay. Well, thank you all for attending our call today. This is Jim. I will be around today to take your questions as I always am and feel free to give me a call and can answer any other questions that you have. And with that, thank you again and have a good weekend everybody. Mike Hilton : Alright, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Candis and good morning and happy holidays to all those listening. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. I am here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019d like to welcome you to our conference call today, Friday, December 12, 2014 on Nordson\u2019s fourth quarter results and first quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at www.nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until December 19, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 38856478. During this conference call, forward-looking statements maybe made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the Company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our fiscal year 2014 fourth quarter and full-year results and a bit about our first quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Thank you for attending Nordson\u2019s 2014 fourth quarter conference call. Nordson\u2019s global team continue to meet our customer needs at the highest level and delivered record fourth quarter sales, operating profit and earnings per share. I am particularly pleased with the 13% organic sales volume growth we delivered in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. This growth was broad-based across all segments and geographies. Operating margin in the quarter was 23%, two percentage points higher than the prior years fourth quarter and diluted earnings per share grew by 23% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, the rate significantly outpacing the strong top line growth. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong and from a balance sheet perspective we remained very liquid with significant capacity for appropriate capital deployment. We continued to create value for our shareholders through our balanced approach to capital deployment. During the quarter we closed on the acquisitions of Avalon Laboratories and Dima Group to expand our positions in medical and electronic end markets. We increased our annual dividend and we continue to prudently invest in the repurchase of Nordson\u2019s shares. Our Board of Directors recently authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program effective December 16. We will provide more details on our share repurchase activities later in the call. For the full fiscal year, Nordon\u2019s set company records for sales, operating profit and earnings per share, while executing on a variety of strategic initiatives that will help sustain our success. Full year organic sales growth was 6% compared to last year, relatively strong performance against the weak macroeconomic environment. Looking ahead our current backlog and order rates are solid leading us to expect the solid first quarter inline with normal seasonality of our business. I will share additional comments about our current business trends and our near-term outlook momentarily. But first, I will turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our first quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sales in the quarter were $469 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year fourth quarter. This sales improvement included a 13% increase in organic volume, a 3% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions and a 2% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume increased 9% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Organic volume growth was 7% and the first year effect of the Kreyenborg acquisition added growth of 2%. We generated organic growth in every product line led by strength in disposable hygiene, polymer processing and general product assembly end markets, and in every geography with the exception of the Americas. Sales volume in the advanced technology segment increased 28% over the prior year fourth quarter. Organic volume growth was very strong at 21% and the first year effect of the Avalon and Dima acquisitions added 7% growth. The organic growth was robust in all of the segments product lines in electronics end markets, demand for our automated dispensing, test and inspection, and surface treatment equipment was driven by a diverse set of applications in mobile devices, advanced semiconductor packaging and automotive electronics. Demand also remained very robust in our medical and industrial end markets, where we continued to see excellent growth in our semi-automated dispensing systems and single-use fluid management components. Geographically this segment delivered double-digit organic growth in every region with the exception of the United States. Sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 16% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. The growth was driven by demand for our cold material dispensing equipment in automotive and industrial applications, coating equipment for food and beverage can applications and UV curing equipment for electronics applications. The U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific regions drove the segment growth which was partially offset by software conditions in Japan and the Americas. Gross margin for the total company in the fourth quarter was 55% equal to the level delivered in the prior year despite a higher mix of system revenue were systems comprised 60% of revenue in the current quarter. Operating profit in the fourth quarter was a $106 million an increase of 22% over the prior year and operating margin was 23% as Mike noted an improvement of two percentage points over the prior years fourth quarter. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 25% in the current quarter. On a normalized basis to exclude non-recurring costs in both years operating margin in the current quarter was 26% compared to 27% in the same period a year ago the difference largely attributable to product mix and the negative effects of currency translation. For the full year the Adhesive segments operating margin in fiscal 2014 was 26% equal to the level of a year ago an inclusive of a full year of the Kreyenborg acquisition. Within the Advanced Technology segment operating margin was 26% in the fourth quarter an improvement of five percentage points as compared to the same period a year ago. On a normalized basis to exclude non-recurring costs the current quarters operating margin within this segment was 27% up six percentage points over the prior years fourth quarter. The improvement reflects our ability to leverage increased sales volume and ongoing continues improvement efforts. In the Industrial Coating segment operating margin was 22% in the fourth quarter an improvement of five percentage points over the same period a year ago. This is outstanding performance for this segment which generally has a higher mix of larger dollar, lower engineered systems than the other segments. The improvement over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter reflects our ability to leverage increased sales volume and our continuous improvement initiatives. Continuing down the income statement, net income for the quarter was $72 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share is were $1.13 an increase of 23% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As in previous quarters we've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one time items. On a normalized basis that is to exclude one time items in both years. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 24% over the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. The current quarter\u2019s EBITDA was $123 million up 20% as compared to the same period a year ago. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $105 million and free cash flow before dividends was $90 million an increase of 46% over the year\u2019s fourth quarter and free cash before dividends was 124% of net income reflecting very strong cash conversion in the quarter. We included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. We continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter investing $72 million for the repurchase of shares distributing approximately $14 million in dividends and closing on the acquisitions of Avalon Laboratories and Dima Group B.V. From a balance sheet perspective we've remained very liquid with net debt to EBITDA at 1.8 times trailing 12 month EBITDA as of the end of the fourth quarter and we have approximately $167 million available from cash in our current revolving credit facility. As we announced earlier t this month, Nordson\u2019s Board of Directors approved a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program effective December 16. As of today, we will have nearly exhausted a $200 million authorization from August of 2013 where approximately $2.7 million shares have been repurchased. We expect to maintain our disciplined approach to repurchases, offsetting the dilutive effect of benefit programs first and buying additional shares opportunistically. We will use the pricing grid within a 10b5 repurchase program, whereby we will not repurchase shares over a certain share price. Over the last four fiscal years, we have repurchased app $414 million or 11% of Nordson\u2019s outstanding shares at a discount of approximately 28% compared to our October 31, 2014 fourth quarter closing price. I\u2019ll provide a few comments on our full year results. Sales for fiscal 2014 were record $1.7 billion and increase of 10% compared to fiscal year 2013. This increase included a 6% increase in organic volumes, a 5% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions and a negative 1% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year. Full year operating profit was $367 million, net income was $247 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.84 all of which are full year records for Nordson. On a normalized basis to exclude non-recurring items in both years diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.88 compared to $3.38 a year ago and increase of 15%. Full year EBITDA was $427 million, a 12% increase over the prior year and free cash before dividends was $245 million or 99% of net income again reflective of strong cash conversion. Dividends paid in fiscal 2014 were $48 million and shares repurchased under the repurchased program were $164 million. I\u2019ll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. As we typically do, we\u2019ve provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with the Avalon and Dima acquisitions, included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending December 07, 2014, order rates are up 10% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment order rates were up 1% over the last 12 weeks as compared to the same period in the prior year. Strength in rigid packaging, disposable hygiene and general product assembly end markets was offset by mixed demand in other end markets. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates over the latest 12 weeks are up 23% compared to the same period in the prior year. Demand remains strong for our automated dispensing equipment supporting diverse applications in mobile devices, advanced semiconductor packaging and automotive electronics. Demand was also strong for fluid management products related to medical and industrial end markets. Within the industrial coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 18% as compared to the prior year. Orders were strongest for cold material dispensing systems, supporting automotive and general industrial end markets. On a geographic basis, total company orders were strong in Asia Pacific, Europe, and the U.S. and softer in the Americas and Japan. Backlog at October 31, 2014 was approximately $223 million an increase of 6% compared to October 31 of 2013 and inclusive of 4% organic growth and 2% growth due to the Avalon and Dima acquisitions. Backlog amounts are calculated at October 31, 2014 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We are forecasting sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 9% as compared to the first quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of 6% to 10%, 3% growth from the first year effective acquisitions and a negative 4% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. At the midpoint of our revenue forecast, we expect first quarter gross margin to be 55% and operating margin is forecasted to be 16%. We are estimating first quarter interest expense of about $4 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30% resulting in first quarter forecast and GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $0.60 per share to $0.70 share inclusive of a $0.01 per share charge related to the step-up in the value of acquired inventory. The midpoint of this range for diluted earnings per share represents an increase of 20% over the prior years first quarter. In addition, this first quarter outlook for following fiscal 2015 full year data points maybe helpful for modeling purposes. For our effective tax rate we are forecasting the full year rate to be about 30% based on current tax law. For capital spending in 2015 we are forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be between $45 million to $50 million slightly lower than 3% of 2014 sales. In addition, we estimate approximately $20 million in capital expenditures associated with our previously announced investment for a new facility in Colorado supporting our fluid management product lines. In summary, our global team delivered record fourth quarter and full year results and our outlook for the first quarter of 2015 is strong given the current macroeconomic environment. With that, I will turn the call over back to you, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I would like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First I want to thank our global team again for their hard work their commitment to our customers and to continuous improvement propelled Nordson to an excellent fourth quarter and another record year. At the midpoint of our first quarter guidance, we are expecting organic sales volume growth of 8% over the prior year\u2019s first quarter. We expect to leverage this growth to deliver improvement in operating margin and in earnings per share as compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. From a broader perspective Nordson\u2019s future remains very bright as we begin fiscal 2015. While the short-term trajectory of the global economy is hard to predict, our long-term strategy remains the same. We are focused on delivering top quartile shareholder returns over the long-term by growing and extending our high-value business model focused on precision dispensing and adjacent technologies. That model includes leading technology, extensive applications know-how and unparalleled global support and service. Our specific priorities for 2015 are extension of our recent efforts, clear and straight-forward. First is to drive organic growth, our goal remains to outpace global GDP. Next is a continuous focus on innovation this includes products and processes. Third, we aim to further improve and integrate recent acquisitions. In addition, our acquisition pipeline remains robust and we look to add additional pieces to the portfolio as well. Fourth, we want to further ingrain continuous improvement the other Nordson\u2019s Business System. And finally, we continue to enhance our leadership and employee development initiatives. Overall the many applications we touch everyday give us a great opportunity in the years ahead. Nordson\u2019s global team remains committed to creating the best customer experience and helping our customer succeed. We expect to be continuing to provide excellent returns for our shareholders over the long-term. At this time, let\u2019s turn to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Radigan of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Joseph K. Radigan: Thank you good morning guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Joe. Joseph K. Radigan: Maybe let\u2019s start with Advanced Tech, how much of the organic growth in the quarter there and maybe some of the strengths in your order growth is coming from new products. I know you talked about, that the inline ex-rate product you thought that could be pretty significant over time are you seeing significant uptick in that or can you maybe bucket around mobile traditional backend in the other niches where you are seeing growth in Advanced Tech? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, maybe I\u2019ll start with last point first Joe. Mobile continues to be a strong part of the equation, but we did see some significant uptick in the quarter and certainly in the order rates in terms of advanced semiconductor packaging and quite frankly with the general improvement in the auto market we're seeing more and more electronics go into their and a lot of our applications around things like conformal coating support that auto market and then we've seen some increase in other niches as well. So its starting to be a bit more broad based at least in this recent quarter and with the orders than maybe it has been over the last year and a half. You will see if that\u2019s sustainable but that\u2019s certainly an encouraging sign and kind of inline with what folks like Gartner are starting to predict for next year. As far as new products, we have a number of new products coming out this year, but we have some traction with some new dispense products in the electronic side of things. I think we mentioned last time, we got our first order in terms of the new wafer inspection tool, we expect another one to come through here shortly and we have nice prospect list that should fill out the rest of the I guess the year. And of course we are adding capability to address the tiering side of things in that business with expanding our capability in Suzhou and quite frankly the Dima acquisition is a product line extension for us that will give us a mid-tier product to support that activity. And then finally in that area, our medical business is doing really well, we're expanding our product lines, we're getting good traction with those expanded products lines and our core EFD business has also been very solid both in electronics and in the general markets. So a pretty good story all around at this point a little different than the beginning of the year. Joseph K. Radigan: Yes, okay. And then in industrial coatings, I mean a very impressive margin performance there kudos to Doug and his team there, but how much of that is mix versus productivity improvement, favorable raw materials, I know one you - that that\u2019s a volume based business and then sort of going forward orders were up 18% for the second quarter in a row. What's the typical order to that conversion time there, do you expect that strong order growth to carrying that revenue growth into the first quarter, because which is typically seasonally slower. Michael F. Hilton: Yes, so a couple of things, as you know the industrial coatings teams have been working hard over the last few years to drive continuous improvement and prove the overall cost performance of that business not only on the sort of current day-to-day activity, but as we introduce products into the marketplace and so it done a really nice job there and like all of our businesses there is good volume leverage and we\u2019ve saw an extraordinary large quarter, probably $8 million to $10 million higher than anything that we\u2019ve seen before, that\u2019s on the strength of things like strong auto, some appliances they\u2019ve activated in the U.S. a good container recapitalization business. And then going forward the orders continue to be strong in those areas as well as a couple of others, the typical lead times for those systems related businesses are longer than most of our businesses as they are in that sort of way to 12-week timeframe, but obviously they factor into our expectations in the first quarter. Joseph K. Radigan: Okay, and then maybe lastly for Greg, corporate expense was a little elevated in the quarter I am assuming there is some deal cost in there from the acquisitions that you did, but how should we think about the run rate going forward for corporate expense? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yes, I think the run rate that we think about fiscal 2015 will be in that $40 million range similar to what we saw in the fiscal 2014. Joseph K. Radigan: Okay, thank you guys. Gregory A. Thaxton: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Franzreb of Sidoti. Your line is now open. John E. Franzreb: Good morning guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, John. John E. Franzreb: Just going back to Advanced Tech. Mike it sounds like the growth here is more coming from maybe in new market opportunities in automotive rather than a major shift in custom product development time in mobile. Is that the case or you might not hearing this correctly? Michael F. Hilton: No, I would say we\u2019ve had this quarter and the order rates look like a more balanced portfolio than maybe saw on the last quarter or two where mobile is the primary driver. So the Auto business globally has been improving for a number of years and what you\u2019re seeing is an increase penetration of electronics type products into auto and that\u2019s started more recently to translate into capacity. And so as it translates into capacity we see some opportunities and I mentioned conformal coating that\u2019s just one application where we support that activity. So I think that\u2019s good and then on the mobile remains strong and everybody is trying to come up with wearable products that we\u2019re seeing some opportunity there. And I think as we mentioned last time we started to get some traction penetrating the Chinese mobile market, it\u2019s early and it\u2019s not a 100% clear what degree of automation that will go to, but we got our first orders there. So that\u2019s encouraging as well. John E. Franzreb: Okay. Michael F. Hilton: Just it\u2019s not to loose track, it\u2019s not all electronics. Our general industry fluid management, the components business has been strong and the medical business has been particularly strong. So right now there is a nice balance, a little bumpier earlier on as the mobile waves come through, but in this latest quarter and the near-term it\u2019s a little bit more balanced. John E. Franzreb: Right, I mean that\u2019s kind of how I figured it, that\u2019s how the business would be more steady state, but the variance would largely come from what we\u2019re seeing in mobile and having mobile strong this time of year, it seems counter intuitive to me? Thanks. Michael F. Hilton: Yes, it\u2019s a little bit different than just the phone launches, because there are a whole bunch of people trying to do more, more wearables, so we\u2019re seeing some orders from that as well. But the more traditional advanced semiconductor packaging, we started to see that tick up as well and as I mentioned Gardner's forecasting a pretty robust year for next year, it\u2019s never a 100% correct, and then some of those local Chinese wins are helping a bit so. John E. Franzreb: Okay, fair enough. And in Adhesive dispensing, it sound like in your press release that the polymer processing business was again improving for the second consecutive quarter, but the margin profile may suggest that\u2019s not the case, its by [X] is still a drag can you just walk us where we are in the recovery of that business? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, I would say maybe I\u2019ll just touch on the overall margin piece for adhesives first and then I\u2019ll answer the second part of that question. The overall margins for adhesive in the quarter were impacted by two things. One currency, without currency on a normalized basis would be flat year-over-year. We also took a bit of a write-off as we wound down part of our historical web coating business in Europe. And so those two things impacted the margin in the short-term currency first, and then that write-down and that\u2019s with a greater mix of systems versus parts in general and a greater mix of sort of things like nonwovens product assembly and the polymer area that tend to be more systems oriented and say package much tends to be more components. I would say if you look at polymer processing, right now the injection molding end markets are solid, film side of business is still sluggish and still a drag. In general I would say the slowdown in Europe, the slowdown in China, the slowdown in the Americas are not helping that from a order perspective, because it\u2019s really impacting the capital expenditure side of things, and on a demand side it\u2019s not chewing up the capacity fast enough. So that\u2019s still a little bit of drag on the film side, the injection side is pretty solid. John E. Franzreb: Okay. And one last question since you opened the door. Greg could you kind of walk us through the currency impact on the P&L. Just some of the puts and takes we should be cognizant of given the recent moves in the year on the Yen. Gregory A. Thaxton: Yes, what you see in the quarter and clearly that\u2019s embedded in our guidance for the first quarter is the translation effect primarily Euro and the Yen. And so in the current quarter as Mike mentioned we\u2019ve got a heavier exposure within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, so X the currency effect we would have been neutralize Mike mentioned to prior year and in the current quarter it was drag on EPS by about $0.04 per share. Now when we guide to currency impact of 4% on the top line for the first quarter, we\u2019ve provided some modeling that kind of coordinate between the percentage impact on sales and percentage impact on prior EPS and so. We see that to be, kind of mid cents to high single-digit cents per share impact in the first quarter that\u2019s kind of our rule of thumb that we use and we include some of that on our investor presentation. Michael F. Hilton: Yes, so if you look at sort of 1% revenue hit, you might be rule of thumb 2.5% on the earnings side. Gregory A. Thaxton: Right. John E. Franzreb: Perfect. Thank you very much guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kevin R. Maczka: Thanks good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Kevin. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Kevin. Kevin R. Maczka: Can we - again going back to Advanced Tech considering the deals that we\u2019ve just done here the Avalon and the Dima and the growth rates that we\u2019ve seen in all these various components Mike and can you size for us where that mix spend now in terms of mobile and auto and fluid management medical some of the big buckets there. What is the mix look like now? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, if you look at the sort of the total segment kind of - roughly half of it would fall into what we call our systems business and that\u2019s electronic systems business as largely electronics and about half of it would fall in two more of the component or semi-automated side of things, which have a bit of electronics overall in it. Gregory A. Thaxton: And that\u2019s what we refer to as fluid management. Michael F. Hilton: That\u2019s what we refer to as fluid management. So roughly sort of half and half, within fluid management side of things we have electronic piece we\u2019ve got a general industry piece and we have a medical piece. The medical piece is growing, probably next year we\u2019ll be somewhere in the range that\u2019s $70 million, $80 million $100 kind of range on the medical piece alone. The general industry pies is a broad based set of applications, everything from materials that are packed and filled that go into caulking applications to, herbicide, pesticide, dispensing to a variety of different manufacturing activities largely related to sort of plastic components. On the electronics side, we're still more heavily weighted to the mobile, going back several years it might have been a third mobile, a third components sort of mixed markets and if they are sort of traditional semiconductor packaging, its considerably more skewed to the mobile. So it\u2019s probably closer to 50% or so, but we're seeing here more recently is that more traditional packaging piece starting to come back. We've seen a few starts and stops before people are a little bit more optimistic right now, if that\u2019s going to continue and we're certainly seeing orders in those areas like advanced semi-packaging and some of the traditional packaging. And then we're also supply components that go into a variety of different devices, a lot led by mobile, but some others and the auto piece is really - that\u2019s a big MINS type market, you know where you are taking electronics signals and converting to mechanical actions. So you could thing about - almost nothing is mechanical these days, completely in terms of wire linkages and things like that its all electronic signals to final endpoint. So that\u2019s growing, we see that particularly where auto is strong in the U.S. in Europe and quite frankly even in china now as the auto market grows there. So still weighted to the mobile side, but some of those other things are coming on, hopefully that will sustain it so. Kevin R. Maczka: Okay great. Shifting back over to adhesives margins, I guess if I understood you right, currency was the biggest drag there in the quarter that will be an issue we face as we go into 2015 as well, I\u2019m just wondering, I know you don\u2019t guide the full year, but it seems like it will be hard to grow adhesive margins even with some volume leverage from organic growth here if we still got that currency headwind unless I guess the mix dynamic gets much better. Is that kind of a fair way to directionally think about that? Gregory A. Thaxton: I think its going to be, who knows where the currency is going to go, I mean I don\u2019t know that anybody predicted the sort of dramatic change recently here in the Yen and the Euro, but if nothing change from where we are today we probably have another quarter or two of impact on a year-on-year basis that will create a headwind and we\u2019ll challenge the margins particularly in that business. It\u2019s not exclusive in that business, but if you look at the size of that business in Europe and if you look at the size of the business in Japan and quite frankly we haven\u2019t talked about, but it\u2019s the nice part of the business in Brazil and all of those are under pressure and so - that\u2019s probably at least another quarter or two of impact if nothing changes. Now, if the Europeans get aggressive with quantitative easing approach and help do something to boost the sort of the economy there that may change, certainly the Japanese are trying to figure out what to do, but it\u2019s not obvious that changes in the next quarter and maybe it\u2019s another quarter or so beyond that we would see that impact and yes that would be helping. Kevin R. Maczka: Got it and just finally from me just from a macro standpoint with Europe soft, China slowing, Japan in recession you had very strong order numbers in both Europe and Asia-Pac and I guess Asia-Pac is probably explainable by the strength in Advanced Tech. Can you just speak to the Europe portion in the plus 10 order number there? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, so part of that is a function of the market segments we are in on the particular products. So we are seeing some - quite frankly and surprisingly we are seeing a good order book even though the economy looks like it\u2019s struggling. So each of the businesses are pretty strong. The coating business we\u2019re still seeing some strong activity on the container side of the business and on the auto side of the business, those two things are solid, on Advanced Tech, in Europe it\u2019s mostly related to those auto type applications and some other back in packaging. On adhesives, we do export out of Europe to other countries for things like nonwovens and so forth, because there is large OEM base there, so some of it where benefiting from that. And quite frankly in the very short-term there are some projects that have come through that maybe more timing than anything else, so there is a little bit of a bump there from timing. But clearly in a number of our businesses we\u2019re taking share as well. So there is a variety of things there that make that look a little different than what you would expect given the softness as you described. Kevin R. Maczka: Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. D. Mark Douglass : Hi, good morning gentlemen. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Mark. Gregory A. Thaxton: Hi, Mark. D. Mark Douglass : Greg, if there are any significant, well first of all do you expect any significant investments going into 2015, I mean like you did in 2013, you had some new products, you are investing heavily in, say tech, anything we should anticipate for 2015 and taking that into consideration if we still saw kind of a mid single-digit organic growth here. What kind of incremental margin should we apply in a range to 2015? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, on your first question, incremental to 2014 I wouldn\u2019t see anything to call out with the exception on as I mentioned the CapEx side where we\u2019ve got the completion of the facility in Colorado. And let me just comment and I\u2019ll let Greg answer the rest of those. So on new products we do have a lot of new products coming in, but I\u2019d say they are more in the normal course of business rather than the step outs like particularly the wafer project that we talked about last year. Gregory A. Thaxton: Yes, then on the incremental margin, markets it\u2019s going to - it now gets to what we talked about in a mid single-digit organic, it\u2019s where by segment what\u2019s the mix impact of that going to be. What are going to be the growth drivers of that total top line growth? If you look at what we delivered in the fourth quarter here on a normalized basis, it was about 36%, normalized incremental margin, of course we\u2019ve got the currency impact that\u2019s having an impact on the margins embedded in there. So a tough question to answer without knowing what\u2019s going to be the driver of the top line growth. Michael F. Hilton: Yes, I mean and if you look at sort of historical let\u2019s currency side, the coatings business just by the nature of that business being all engineered systems with a lot of buyout, incremental margin in those businesses tend to be in the sort of, pick a number 30% kind of range plus or minus. Advanced tech a little bit better, adhesive is generally considerably better, but as we said that\u2019s where the currency impact is going to effect us. So overall in a sort of non fluctuating currency market somewhere in that 30% to 50% depending on the mix is what we would expect, currency is going to weigh on that. D. Mark Douglass : Okay, and looking at adhesives again, good, good, very good growth in 2014 with 6% organic growth. Can you talk about what, whether some more significant end markets were that drove that, you mentioned market share can you peg how much was share gains or if you think the different markets grew at how much was it freedom. Is that material yet or is that still trying to gain traction. Michael F. Hilton: So if you look at it in the packaging - really in packaging nonwovens and product assembly they were all good. I would say this year we saw probably more of a step up in the nonwovens and the product assembly area which tend to be bigger ticket items and packaging was solid. So you know the nonwovens are things like you know the consumer non-durables like diapers and incontinence products and feminine hygiene products. And the product assembly is sort of construction, construction related activities as well. And then we saw an up tick you know also in the polymer side with both in the sort of the palletizing stuff that came with Kreyenborg and then the general sort of injection side of the business there. There is a share element to all of these businesses as we continue to direct introduce technology. I would say that\u2019s not the biggest driver of things. And then I would say freedom and then freedom in liberty combination we\u2019ve probably delivered where we thought we are going to be from a revenue and profitability standpoint not quite where we thought we were going to be on the unit side of things. I think we are encouraged by what we see there but you know one of the things, that\u2019s a little bit of gating items that we talked about is the new adhesives that we are going to increase the mileage and were more difficult to melt are still not readily available, and this has to do with some things in the ethylene supply chain. You know all the suppliers are saying next year we are going to see those, but they said that we are going to see those this year. So I\u2019m not trying to throw those guys under the bus, its just they don\u2019t control the full supply chain and there are some other issues upstream of them that are impacting that. So I\u2019d say revenue and profit wise we were on track and that contributed to things. But I think we also did well in the emerging markets with our tiering products. So we\u2019ve done really well in particularly on the adhesive side with our tiering products. So\u2026 D. Mark Douglass : Okay and then the mix with nonwovens products, product assembly growing a little faster than packaging that explains that\u2019s when you are talking about the mix impacting the margins? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, those tend to be - yes so if you look at the most components sort of only looking types of things are in the packaging side and as you go to nonwovens and then certainly the products assembly, you have got more of a partial system type sale there that tend to be good margins, but lower than the packaging margins. D. Mark Douglass : Right and you said parts were about 40% of sales. Michael F. Hilton: Yes, they were about a percent or so higher systems than parts year-over-year. Gregory A. Thaxton: Right. D. Mark Douglass : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer, your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Hey Glynn. Christopher Glynn : So a set of question about the acquisition pipeline and wondering how much of your kind of focus in pipeline is in that medical component space and what your expectations might be there? Michael F. Hilton: Well we like the space, the acquisitions that we made, prior to this past year have had nice double-digit growth as we've continued to penetrate the market, expand the product line, the little product line acquisition that we bought from Covidien and exceeded our expectations this year. We really like the new business coming in with Avalon that gets us more broadly into cardio and pulmonary type of services. And as we've said in the past, it\u2019s a pretty fragmented market in terms of the folks that make a number of these and particularly sort of plastic oriented highly engineered components that go to the big OEMs and that\u2019s the place we like to be and so there is still opportunities out there that run the gamut of just a simple product line extension to something that\u2019s a little bit bigger and maybe even a little bit bigger than the acquisitions we made today from a revenue standpoint. So we're working a list there, we like it, we like the opportunity to consolidate, the new facility in Colorado is not only helping the medical business, but some of our other EFD businesses. With Avalon, we've got a manufacturing capability in Mexico that we\u2019ll likely expand and take advantage of that for more of our assembly type operations. So we feel good about that and the opportunities that are out there, timings never ever clear and necessarily win everything you look at if it ends up being an auction. Christopher Glynn : Okay thanks for that. Do you ever think much about hedging on the FX side? Gregory A. Thaxton: Chris this is Greg, hedging for us on FX side is we were trying to anticipate where our source of foreign revenues would be. Its challenging to forecast that and then to do anything to hedge it can create quite a bit of volatility in the P&L if you are wrong. We do hedge some of our inter company volumes where it\u2019s more - there is more surety around those volumes, so we do some of that, but to try to get in front of hedging the third-party revenues I\u2019d be concerned about the volatility that that could create in the P&L. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then lastly you\u2019ve had a nice string of quarters of good growth at ADS and then the last two quarters pretty flattish on the orders, we think that that might level out on organic for while here or you see that same positive on the organic for fiscal 2015? Gregory A. Thaxton: Well, our overall sort of long-term view to that sort of businesses 5%, 6%, 7% kind of growth, last year 2013 it wasn\u2019t much growth, this year we saw pretty nice growth. I think as far this comes down to what do you think the macro assumption is. Our view is this year global GDP is probably going to come in at a little over 2%, 2.2% or something like that 2.3% or kind of anticipating next year it looks similar, so we should get some leverage over and above the GDP, but again that business on a revenue line will be impacted by the currency in the short-term. So we think we can grow that in a multiple of GDP, we don\u2019t think next year is going to be super robust I mean the U.S. looks strong, but every place sales doesn\u2019t look stronger than this year unless something turns around in Europe and Japan, which could happen with policies, but we\u2019re not any better than anybody else forecasting that. So we should outpace the GDP I think where some of the things like nonwovens and product assembly here into more of an investment cycle than on day-to-day sort of operating upgrade and improvement cycle and that can very year-to-year depending our people, where our people are. So we saw a good year this year, I think the U.S. we expect to see strength going forward, China we think we\u2019ll pick a not at the rates that maybe it\u2019s been very mostly about Europe. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys good morning. Gregory A. Thaxton: Hey, Allison. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Just back on the comments about freedom I know you said at adhesive is one of the reasons that volumes haven\u2019t necessarily picked up, but is there any concerns on competitive reaction holding that volume down? Gregory A. Thaxton: No, we placed hundreds of units out there end markets plus through OEMs and our liberty product was the next sort of tiered opportunity geared more at the OEMs, so if you went to packaging show in Chicago, you would be impressed with just this last Monday you would be impressed by what you see on the OEM side of that. So now from a competitive standpoint we have good competitors out there. We do think we have the best model of the combination of technology and service out there. As we talked about the past part of this is a function of what\u2019s these overall riding benefit here and when is the last upgrade that our customer basis have gone through. So we between sort of the last major product launch in this one we didn\u2019t stop, we were out selling feed systems and upgraded nozzles and dispense equipment, and so somebody just bought that combination, they are not going to be ready to buy it right now. So big driver was sort of the higher mileage, adhesives. So what that means? Is useless adhesive for the same bonding properties and they are just not available yet. So I\u2019d say we did pretty well as I said on revenue where we expected and profit probably where or better than we expected, line was little short, but it\u2019s not competitive issue. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. And then I guess just broadly speaking a lot of positive momentum heading into 2015, whether region or businesses is there, anything I guess overly concerned about at this point for next year? Michael F. Hilton: I don\u2019t know that I would say overly, but if you think about where we\u2019re at right now, the U.S. looks strong and looks like it\u2019s continuing to get strong, that\u2019s good for us. Europe has gone backwards at the moment, wasn\u2019t blockbuster this past year, and it\u2019s going backwards, so we\u2019re not seeing that in our order rates yet, because of some of the markets that were involved within and doing well. I think China will be, okay, but it\u2019s at the new normal, so it\u2019s not that sort of double-digit kind of growth that you saw. Asia, outside of China, doing pretty well. Japan is going to struggle this year, Latin America is not going to comeback. So I\u2019d say globally the mix will look different, but that\u2019s why we think it\u2019s going to be a sort of a modest growth. Quite frankly in a short-term the biggest concern is the currency side of that and particularly given the dramatic moves in the Euro and the Yen. And we bypass that later in the year, it\u2019d be great to see some monetary fiscal policy out there that would help modify that before we get out to say the third quarter or so. Gregory A. Thaxton: And we\u2019ll certainly do what we can on pricing actions and others to try to mitigate some of the impact of currency, but we\u2019ve recognize it that\u2019s a headwind. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great, thanks guys. Michael F. Hilton: Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Charles D. Brady: Thanks good morning guys. Gregory A. Thaxton: Hey, Charlie. Charles D. Brady: Just a clarification on the parts mix that 40% is that companywide or that\u2019s Adhesive Dispensing? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yes, that was total Charlie. Adhesive Dispensing as we\u2019ve said in the past the segments are kind of they pretty much overlay that total company, on any given quarter adhesive might tend to be a bit more in the parts then total company, but all the segments are very close to that total company number. Yes in my comments Charlie I was just year-over-year adhesives probably 1% more systems than parts. Michael F. Hilton: Yes, and it was. Charles D. Brady: Okay all right so that obviously had at least some impact on the margin as well\u2026 Michael F. Hilton: Yes, it does. Charles D. Brady: I just want to go back and look at the Adhesive Dispensing orders in the quarter just so I understand it a little better I mean 1% this quarter zero last quarter. How much of that is a currency headwind, you\u2019ve framed in terms of kind of global GDP. But that would obviously be below global GDP. So I am wondering how much of an impact really the currency has hit you in this quarter or something else going on that\u2019s maybe a headwind to that orders? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, I would say it\u2019s not really a currency issue from that order perspective. I think really what we are starting to see things are things like, if you look at certain economies and what\u2019s going on mainly outside the, outside the U.S. And a little bit, Americas for example are soft, Japan we saw an impact pretty sizeable impact here from an order perspective and even a little bit in the U.S. which could be timing related issue. So not overly concerned with what we\u2019re seeing there because it would be just timing year-on-year. Charles D. Brady: Okay thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Global Hunter. Your line is now open. Walter S. Liptak: Hi, thanks good morning everyone. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Walt. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning Walter. Walter S. Liptak: I want to ask you kind of touched on this already, but and maybe just to frame at this way with the organics last year at plus 6% in your 2014. it looks like heading into this year things are a little bit slower, what's the tone that you are getting from customers in terms of like budgeting for 2015 and if it is a little bit more cautious and we're going to expect organics, something lower than 6%. Is there something you do to mitigate, is there a cost focus or is that some kind of restructuring, you mentioned Avalon and taking to the manufacturing kind of into Mexico. I wonder if you can just address that cost side. Michael F. Hilton: Yes. So just to clarify, coming into the year at least with for the first quarter, the kind of mid-point of our guidance is about 8% organic. So still at least the start is reasonably solid and from a customer perspective in Europe I would say across the businesses sort of the prospect was bid activity, dialogue is considerably more encouraging than the macro number that you are seeing from an economic perspective. I would say if you go to a place like Japan we've got project activity there, but it\u2019s not quite as robust if you look at it. So that\u2019s a little bit different. I would say if you look at China, solid cross prospect list and good expectations, but you know they are at a new normal. So we think that probably looks a little bit like this year or maybe even slightly less than this year from a macro standpoint, so it\u2019s kind of a mix. On a global GDP basis, we're still expecting a two plus number, I think if you went back a couple of three months, people might have expected a three plus number that wasn\u2019t our expectation. So we kind of look like next year is like this year. So on a volume basis we would expect volume growth, on a revenue basis we are going to see some impact at least in the short-term unless something changes on the currency side. From an overall cost perspective, we have a pretty robust continuous improvement plan, we've got a number of things that we're working on across all of the businesses from the day-to-day activity that embrace in our Nordson business system to some project activity. So we're constantly focused on that. In the earlier part of the year we can respond pretty quickly and the earlier part of this year when things were a little bit soft, we did also some restructuring in certain businesses to lower our cost base and that\u2019s played out in improved earnings and margin as the volume has come back. So we could respond pretty quickly, we look at things pretty closely. The Avalon addition or benefit we got with the facility in Mexico and we probably will expand that facility both because of the demand and then the opportunity maybe bit of optimize our supply chain. It is a good thing that we\u2019re looking at across our other businesses as well in terms of improving footprint efficiency and supply chain efficiency. So there are opportunities there, but in a short-term - we go into every year starting off cautious still we see the line and kind of play out, we are encouraged by the pretty solid order rates we see across the businesses right now, but we are concerned in particular Europe and Japan I\u2019d say, even though in Europe we are not seeing that right now, Japan maybe we are seeing that right now. Walter S. Liptak: Okay, just to clarify so what you\u2019re hearing from your customers, what you\u2019re thinking about is something similar in terms of organics for 2015 versus 2014? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, I\u2019d say that global mix is maybe a little different maybe stronger in the U.S. then it was last year, but I\u2019d say even the European across most of our businesses European customers are pretty optimistic. That said from a macro, if you look at our business model is strong, our market focus is strong we\u2019re going to win the battle most of the time, but we float on the general economy. So we\u2019re not going to be impervious to what\u2019s going on in the general economy. So your guess is as good as mine as how Europe, Japan plays out whether anything comes, where the Europeans can get together and drive more growth there, whether the Japanese latest plan can improve things. I think China will manage their growth and will see that and benefit from it and outside of China and Japan and Asia we see a pretty robust and positive set of expectations from the customer base there. So it\u2019s a mixed bag a little bit different than a mixed - then last years sort of mixed bag kind of our expectation is similar growth, if we see more we\u2019ll benefit from that, if we see less we\u2019ll adjust from a cost perspective. Walter S. Liptak: Okay, it sounds good. The U.S. part of it is the mix, the margin mix better in the U.S., is there more adhesives or if the U.S. strengthens here, what do you think the margin mix will looks like? Gregory A. Thaxton: I think as they continue to strengthen we might see more systems in general to the mix, and so certainly if you look at the sort of orders, order rate going into the first quarter, we\u2019ve got really strong orders is our coatings and technology business and software and the adhesives to start. So that mix doesn\u2019t necessarily help the margin, but we would expect adhesives to pick up as the year goes on. Walter S. Liptak: Okay, got and all right thanks for that and with the accelerated share repurchase, is there a preference that you are signaling for acquisition or repurchase over acquisitions or is that just that you\u2019ve got the cash flow and you can do both. Gregory A. Thaxton: Well, we have a balanced program out there and I think we\u2019ve talked a little bit in the past about our priorities. I mean number one to support organic growth, number two to continue with the dividend approach and we are getting up into that 20% range, but we would like probably get a little bit higher in the mid 20, so we keep pushing that. The number three would be to find the right kind of acquisitions, but we have no control over availability and timing, although we\u2019re working it, right. And number four to be opportunistic on the share repurchase and we always want to have a program in place, so we can take advantage of it. I mean if you just look in this last quarter, we\u2019ve had some fairly loud movements for this where the stock dropped back into the upper 60s and we were buying much more aggressively as part of our program when that happened. So we always what to have the ability out there to take advantage of market movements and it would seem that at the moment maybe volatility is picking up. Walter S. Liptak: Okay, got it. Okay, thanks very much guys. Michael F. Hilton: And Candis we probably have time for one more question and then we\u2019ll have to sign off. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Liam Burke of Wunderlich Securities. Your line is now open. Liam D. Burke: Thank you. Good morning Mike. Good morning Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Liam. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Liam. Liam D. Burke: Mike, Nordson Business System\u2019s is a big push of one of your strategic focuses could you give us a sense of the progress, your continuous improvement initiatives, plans have made in the polymer acquisitions? Michael F. Hilton: Yes, so if you look at overall the Nordson Business System, there is probably 6 to 8 areas of focus that we have and that\u2019s everything from new product development to the overall supply chain that would include sourcing, manufacturing, distribution and logistics to things like sales force effectiveness to pricing and segmentation, a variety of things like that. I would say we\u2019ve made good progress on the polymer side on things like, pricing I would say we\u2019ve made reasonable progress in terms of improving sort of the supply chain aspects of it. So think about that as sourcing and manufacturing. The biggest benefits as we\u2019ve talked about there will come from overall optimization of the supply chain. And then levering the organizations together and those are the ones we also said would take little bit longer. We are doing some things right now to facilitate that supply chain optimization and over the next couple of years that should play out. And then from an organizational standpoint you know it comes down to how do we align sort of behind the front lines the engineering side of things and then we continue to work through the direct versus, distributor versus agent approach there. And so those things have the biggest impact so those are still to come. So I would say good progress today we need more volume to translate that into bigger benefit and then couple of bigger things are going to take another couple of years probably. Liam D. Burke: Okay. Great. With the Colorado springs facility at capacity, obviously the necessity to build a new facility was there, but Mike are there any other economic benefits are going to get from the new facility medical facility in Colorado? Michael F. Hilton: Well, we continue to that - for that to be sort of our state-of-the-art in terms of the highest level of automation. And so as we build out, not only to support demand we are likely to include the capability to manufacturer other products there and preclude some investments that we need to make and say other EFD type facilities and be able to do that there in a more automated way so we\u2019ll get some benefits from that. And then in the combination of now having this capability for some labor intensive aspects of the business the with Mexico facility, we\u2019ll optimize where we do, the sort of more highly automated activity versus where we do more manual activity. So there is some combined benefits there, but we go we keep going to more sophisticated capability on these facilities. So an example maybe a 16-cavity machine becomes a 32 or 64 cavity machine where you are sort of doubling, triple or quadrupling the output those kinds of things. Liam D. Burke: Great. Thank you Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. James R. Jaye: Okay. So this is Jim. I want to thank everyone for attending the call. And I do have time today I do have some calls today but please get in the queue if you have follow-ups. I am also around next week and glad to take questions throughout next as well. So thank you everyone and very happy holidays to you. Thank you. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. Please begin. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Latoya, and good morning. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson's Director of Investor Relations. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, February 25, 2015, on Nordson's FY 2015 first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until March 4, 2015, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 797703908. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance, based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our fiscal year 2015 first quarter results, and a bit about our second quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead? Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending Nordson's 2015 first quarter conference call. Nordson's team continue to perform at a high level and delivered record first quarter sales and earnings per share. I'm particularly pleased with the 8% organic sales volume growth we delivered in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. This growth was broad-based across the majority of our product lines and geographies, and quite impressive given the challenges presented by a weak macroeconomic environment. Operating margin in the quarter improved 2 percentage points compared to the prior year, and diluted earnings per share grew 28% compared to the first quarter a year ago, the rate significantly outpacing the strong top line growth. While these results were strong, they were also impacted by the effect of negative currency translation compared to the first quarter a year ago. Looking ahead, our current backlog and order rates are very strong, up 14% for the latest 12 weeks as compared to prior year. We expect to see solid sequential revenue improvement in the second quarter, though year-over-year results will be impacted by currency headwinds, given the current exchange rates. I'll speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our second quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sales in the quarter were $379 million, an increase of 5.4% over the prior year's first quarter. This sales improvement included, and I'm rounding here, an 8% increase in organic volume, a 3% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions, and a 5% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. This strength of the organic growth in the quarter highlights the benefits of our business model, and the value that we bring to our customers. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume decreased less than 1% as compared to the prior-year first quarter. Organic growth was solid in product lines serving disposable hygiene, general product assembly, rigid packaging, and plastic injection, end markets. We continue to see softness in plastic extrusion, and polymer compounding and palletizing end markets. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 38% over the prior year first quarter. Organic volume growth was very strong at 29%, and the first year effect of the Avalon and Dima acquisitions added 10% growth. Organic growth was robust in automated dispensing product lines, serving mobile device end markets, and advanced semiconductor packaging applications, as well as our fluid management product lines serving electronics, general industrial assembly, and medical end markets. Sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 4% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The growth was driven by demand for our cold materials and powder coating product lines. Gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was 55%, one percentage point higher than the level delivered in the prior year, primarily due to segment and product mix. Operating profit in the quarter was $63 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year, and operating margin was 17%, an improvement of 2 percentage points over the prior year's first quarter. Currency negatively impacted gross margin and operating margin in the quarter by approximately 1%. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 22% in the current quarter. Excluding the effects of currency, operating margin would have been equal to the prior year's performance on slightly lower sales volume. Within the Advanced Technology segment, operating margin was 20% in the first quarter or 21% excluding short-term purchase accounting charges related to the step-up in value of acquired inventory. This is an improvement of 10 percentage points as compared to the same period a year ago \u2013 excuse me, and reflects strong operating leverage on the increased volume. Operating margin performance for the segment was also negatively impacted by about 1% due to currency. In the Industrial Coating segment, operating margin was 7% in the first quarter or 8% excluding the negative impact of currency. This performance reflects the seasonally lower first quarter sales volume, typical of this segment and a greater mix of engineered systems revenue compared to the same period a year ago. Given the typical seasonality pattern of this segment, we would expect to generate significant operating leverage on higher volume as the year progresses. Corporate expense in the quarter was up $1.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase is related to one-time settlement cost of a pension obligation for a business we sold in 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, reflecting the retroactive benefit of the 2014 R&D tax credit. Continuing down the income statement, net income for the quarter was $43 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, an increase of 28% over the last year's first quarter. As in previous quarters, we've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one-time items. The current quarter's EBITDA was $79 million, up 16% as compared to the same period a year ago. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $26 million, and free cash flow before dividends was $9 million. Free cash flow compared to the prior year was impacted by an increase in working capital mostly related to the timing of receivable collections, and construction costs for our previously announced fluid management facility in Colorado. We expect free cash flow in the second quarter to benefit from the collection of these receivables as we trend back towards typical days sales outstanding. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. We continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter, distributing approximately $14 million in dividends and investing $71 million for the repurchase of shares. Shares repurchased in the quarter more than offset the estimated dilutive effect of shares to be distributed for employee benefit programs during the year. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very liquid, with net debt to EBITDA at 1.9 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter. I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. As we typically do, we've provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks, as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis, and with the Avalon and Dima acquisitions, included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending February 15, 2015, order rates are up 14% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, order rates were up 6% over the last 12 weeks as compared to the same period in the prior year, where we generated order growth in all four Adhesive product lines. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates over the latest 12 weeks are up 18%, compared to the same period in the prior year, where we generated very strong growth rates in both our electronics system product lines, and fluid management product lines. Mobile device, advanced packaging, general industrial, and medical end markets are the primary drivers of growth for this segment. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 39%, as compared to the prior year. Order rates were strong across nearly all product lines. On a total company basis, orders were strong in all regions except Europe, which was down slightly from the prior year, due to the timing of larger nonwoven system orders and softness in certain end markets served by our polymer product lines. Backlog at January 31, 2015, was approximately $230 million, an increase of 8% compared to January 31 of 2014, and inclusive of 6% organic growth, and 2% growth due to the Avalon and Dima acquisitions. Current backlog increased 8% compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. These backlog amounts are calculated at January 31, 2015 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We're forecasting sales to be in the range of down 5% to down 1% as compared to the second quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of down 1% to up 3%; 3% growth from the first year effective acquisitions and a negative 7% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation based on current exchange rates. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect second quarter gross margin to be 55%, and operating margin is forecasted to be 20%. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $4 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 30%, resulting in second quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $0.80 per share to $0.90 per share. We're forecasting the full-year effective tax rate, excluding discrete items to be about 30% based on current tax law. We also expect normal maintenance capital spending for the full-year to be between $45 million to $50 million. In addition, we estimate approximately $13 million remaining in capital expenditures associated with the our previously announced investment for a new facility in Colorado, supporting our fluid management product lines, the bulk of which will be spent in the second quarter. To add a few additional comments related to currency, assuming exchange rates for the rest of fiscal 2015 remain where they are today, we expect currency translation to negatively impact full-year sales by about 5%. We also estimate currency will negatively impact full-year gross margin and operating margin by approximately 1%. In terms of the currency impact on earnings per share, our historical results have shown that, for every 1% change to sales related to currency translation, EPS is impacted approximately 2.5 times that amount in the same direction. This currency impact is due to the translation effect of converting foreign currency sales and costs back to U.S. dollars, which is not hedged. We have for a long-time hedged our cash exposure by using forward contracts. Getting back to first quarter results in summary, our global team delivered a very strong first quarter. We have strong order momentum leading into our second quarter, although the impact of negative currency translation, and the expected timing of shipments for this strong order activity will impact sales in the second quarter. Mike will share more comments relative to the current pace of the business, and our view of sales for fiscal 2015. With that, I'll turn the call over back to you, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, as Greg noted, I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First, I want to thank our global team again for their hard work, their commitment to our customers propel Nordson to a very solid start to our year. At the midpoint of our second quarter guidance, we're expecting sequential sales growth of about 7%, which we should leverage to delivering operating margin approximately 3 percentage points higher than the first quarter, and earnings per share that are 23% higher than the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, we do expect currency translation to remain a significant headwind to revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter and full-year, given current exchange rates. Excluding this currency translation effect, our underlying business remains sound. Our backlog is solid and 12-week order rates are up a strong 14% compared to the same period a year ago. This growth in organic orders are impressive, given the challenging macroeconomic environment. Given the strength, you might expect our organic growth in the second quarter to exceed the 1% level we are forecasting at the midpoint of our guidance, as we typically have a strong correlation between order growth rates and the outlook for the next quarter. To help reconcile this, let me provide some additional color. First, timing does play a role here as the current backlog does include some longer lead time items that are expected to benefit the third quarter. This is particularly true within Advanced Technology and Industrial Coatings segments. In addition, we're optimistic as to our likely success on various projects that are not yet in our backlog, that should generate revenue beyond the second quarter. Our participation in these large dollar projects reflects the consultative approach in applications expertise we bring to our customers, and in several cases is being driven by innovative Nordson technology; due to the competitive reasons and customer confidentiality agreements regarded with the details we can share at this time. Directionally however, we can provide some general commentary. While we're not providing a specific forecast beyond our second quarter, we are optimistic that the current backlog, current order growth rates and project momentum will drive double-digit organic growth in the second half of our year, as compared to the prior year, resulting in high single-digit organic growth for the full-year. From a broader perspective, there are many reasons we continue to feel good about our longer-term prospects. While we can't control currency or other aspects of the macroeconomic environment, there are many things we can control, and that is where we were focused. The worst of these is innovative technology. Nordson earned 211 patents in 2014, driven by our envision process, we continue to introduce products that provide tangible benefits to our customers and are helping to drive organic growth. Second is continuous improvement. The Nordson Business System is our set of tools and best practices for driving improvement in all value streams across the company. We continue to ingrain the Business System in all we do. Third is, adding to the portfolio through targeted and strategic acquisitions. We continue to evaluate opportunities in the spaces we've talked about previously, and are working to optimize our integration processes deliver value faster. Finally, we're focused on making a strong team even better. Our talent management and development initiatives continue to gain momentum, ensuing we're equipped to capture the growth opportunities that we see. Overall, we're focused on providing our customers with the best experience in the industries we serve, and delivering excellent shareholder returns over the long-term. And we will continue our balanced approach for capital allocation, including returning value directly to shareholders with dividends and remaining prudent with regards to our share repurchase activity, and executing on appropriate acquisition opportunities. At this time, let me turn to your questions. Operator : Thank you. And the first question is from Joe Radigan of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Joe K. Radigan: Good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Joe. Joe K. Radigan: Mike, maybe we can start with your comments around the timing in the second quarter. Can you provide any more granularity in terms of growth by segment? I mean, obviously you've got some longer lead time stuffs in ICS, but orders are fairly good in Adhesives and that tends to be to be relatively short cycle, it sounds like there's some longer lead time stuff in Advanced Tech, but there's a \u2013 you have a relatively easy comp on a year-over-year basis, and orders were up almost 20% there, and that business has been growing at a double-digit clip here for, I think three consecutive quarters. So can you maybe reconcile the growth by what you're expecting by segment? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Joe, you did hit the \u2013 sort of the key areas that tend to have bigger projects, and bigger projects tend to be a little bit longer lead item. We also have projects in here where our customers have asked for sort of phased deliveries, so that's also a part of what we're seeing, and that falls into the two areas, in particular that you mentioned the Industrial Coatings and the Advanced Technology area. There are elements of our plastics business that have some longer lead time orders like our pelletizing business that also impact that. So from our perspective, what we've seen is more of systems orders, which is encouraging, and some of those are phased from a delivery standpoint, and that's really the main fact \u2013 chalk it up essentially timing. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. And then, in terms of the cadence of orders that you saw through the 12-week period, first quarter is typically a soft spot in the customer capital cycle, did you see orders \u2013 order rate strengthen in recent weeks, can you kind of talk about how that develop? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Yeah, Joe, as you know it's soft because of the holiday period, and it tends to \u2013 as we talked about in the past, orders tend to get to a low-point, sort of over the holidays, right after the New Year, and then start to pickup, and we absolutely did see that trend where each of the last few weeks has gotten stronger, generally across most businesses. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. And then, maybe lastly, in terms of the operating margin, at the midpoint of your guidance, I think you said, that's expected to be about 20%, that's almost a 250 basis point or about a 250 basis point decline year-over-year, some of that, probably 100 basis points of that I think is the FX, but is there a mix factor as well in the second quarter, in terms of the timing of engineered versus standard stuff? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So you've \u2013 currently have the currency is a significant impact. And then when you look at things, volume is relatively soft and actually down a little bit, so we get a little bit of a negative leverage there, relative to our spend base. So it's not anything that we're alarmed about, again, I think it's largely the timing issue on the organic piece, and we're really pretty encouraged by the prospects that we see in addition to orders already in hand. The currency piece, as Greg said, we're going to deal with over the next couple of quarters, and it is a strong headwind and it does impact margin to the tune of about 100 basis points, maybe a little more in the second quarter, and a little less as we go throughout the year. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Charles D. Brady: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Charlie. Gregory A. Thaxton: Hi, Charlie. Charles D. Brady: Hey, could you give us a sense of what the parts business look like in the quarter, was there any \u2013 I guess, I'm trying to parse out if that had any meaningful impact on the margins, particularly at Adhesive Dispensing? Michael F. Hilton: Year-over-year, it was pretty much the same as last year, around I think, 43% or 44%, Charlie, so no significant impact. Adhesives is one of the areas where we feel the biggest impact from a currency perspective. Charles D. Brady: Right, Right. I just want to go back to Jeff's question on the segment organic growth, particularly on Adhesive Dispensing, because if I'm hearing you correctly, that one \u2013 and I guess, some in the plastics, but the majority of this long lead time or phase-in of orders is happening in ICS and Advanced Tech not so much in Adhesive Dispensing. So can you give us a sense of what you're looking for kind of on organic growth, just on the Adhesive Dispensing in Q2? Michael F. Hilton: Well, I think overall for the year we're thinking \u2013 the things will be consistent with our long-term kind of growth rates. I think in the second quarter, we're looking for things to be a little bit less, and then \u2013 and pick up based on some of the orders, trends coming in. So not too atypical when you look at sort of the more traditional Adhesives. The one area that is strong right now, but can be lumpy is the product assembly piece, because those tend to be bigger systems orders as well. But nothing atypical that we see here in terms of progress on that part of the business. We're engaged by what we see across most of the product lines. Gregory A. Thaxton: And Charlie, it's Greg. I'd just add, quarter-to-quarter we might see some trends \u2013 softening trend in one quarter versus the next. But as Mike mentioned, if we look at that business on a longer-term basis, kind of across the year, we'd expect to see kind of that \u2013 that typical mid single-digit kind of growth rate in Adhesives. Charles D. Brady: Yeah. I guess, I'm just trying to square it up, because you had 6% order growth in the quarter, which was \u2013 that's a good solid order number for Adhesives. And I'm not hearing that you have a lot of longer lead time phase-in on the Adhesive side. So I'm \u2013 unless I'm hearing it incorrectly, so I guess, I'm just trying to square up 6% really good order growth, but maybe not translating into the same kind of growth organically in Q2, am I correct, or I mean, is there stuff that is being phased in like the other two segments, or am I missing a piece here? Michael F. Hilton: It's mainly on the plastic side, that the \u2013 particularly the pelletizer business, that tends to be a little bit longer lead times. So you're seeing that sort of impacted in the near-term. There is nothing unusual in the Adhesive side. As Greg said, you can have some one quarter and other movement based on some orders, and typically those orders will be in the product assembly area that's been pretty strong for us here of late. So nothing unusual there, but we do have our orders in the plastic side, that are little bit longer lead time and that's pulling that number down in the short-term. Charles D. Brady: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, good morning. Gregory A. Thaxton: Hi, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Just want to go back to operating margins, particularly as we look to the back half, you talked about currency headwinds, and it sounds like there's some system headwind there. I'm just trying to marry that with the expected volume improvement. I mean, is it going to be, I mean, should we sort of expect that acceleration on the EBIT side as well? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, I think you know that we've got tremendous incremental margin leverage on volume. So in a typical year, we'll see margin improve from the first quarter throughout the year as volumes improve just on a seasonal basis, and this year based on some of these orders stretching into the third quarter, and what we see from a project list and some new technology introductions, we expect to see that volume lift later in the year, and with that you'll see the margin lift that we typically see across the quarters with volume. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Okay. And then just, even on the second half, you noted some confidence in the second half acceleration in top line growth, is there any segment or end market specifically that you're probably a little bit more concerned about as we look to the back half of the year? Michael F. Hilton: I'd say the growth across most of our segments looks solid. There could be certain end markets that are a little soft here, but we're making them up in others. I'd say, more concern would be around geography, and just because some of the geographies are struggling from a economic perspective. So when you think about the Americas, particularly Latin America, Europe is not as robust and Japan is more of a mixed bag. That said, some of the other geographies have been considerably stronger. So I'd say, it's more of a mixed bag on geography than end market applications. There are obviously some that are pretty strong, and things like auto, medical, electronics, applications including wireless, those kind of things are generally pretty strong. We've got new areas where we're interested in, that are picking up, but for us also, we're introducing a lot of new products this year, I would categorize in the singles category, a nice new incremental growth opportunities or recapitalization opportunities, that I think will also help in our \u2013 getting some traction. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from the Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher D. Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Chris. Christopher D. Glynn: I was \u2013 wanted to go into the second half margin outlook a little bit more, I think in the past, maybe you've offered directional guidance on quantifying a range or expectation for sequential incremental margins. So given the volume outlook, it's a little different modeling this year, given the FX dynamics. So wondering if you could kind of offer some kind of vague or specific rule of thumb? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I mean the incremental margins are significant as the volume grows throughout the year. It does depend a little bit on mix. So for example, the Industrial Coatings, given the nature of scope what we provide there, while they have very good incremental margins that are probably in the 30% kind of range, are different than what we might see in technology, which would be higher and traditional adhesives would be higher yet. So it does depend a little bit on the mix. But we would expect to see strong incremental margins across each of the businesses as it grows throughout the year. You can see from the order rates that we're providing, Industrial Coatings is stepping up nicely and the Advanced Technology is stepping up nicely, so those mix effects will be a little bit lower than, say if all the Adhesives business was stepping up. But we would expect a pretty typical pattern as the volume grows up \u2013 grows for the rest of the year, only to be moderated a little bit by mix. Christopher D. Glynn: Thanks, that's helpful. And then at ADS, just wondering how you'd score the investments in the plastics processing at this point, I think EDI and Xaloy are coming up under \u2013 on about three years with Nordson. And just wondering, if there is any change to your view of the long-term returns and update on how you get there, the integrations et cetera? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Maybe I'll just start with a comment on the \u2013 for the two major end markets that support all that business. As Greg mentioned in his comments, the plastic injection part of the end markets are doing well, and when you think about the products that are being made there, it goes into auto, it goes into electronics, it goes into medical, those areas are all doing pretty well. When you look at the film side of the business, the film side of the business, particularly the high-end film side of the business is really struggling, while there's some increase in demand. Europe slowing, China slowing, Latin America slowing really hurt the sort of supply/demand situation on the film business. So I'd say, we're still struggling pretty significantly on the film business that affects the dyes business the most. A different application like fluid coatings in the dyes business is doing really well, but the bigger application is struggling. So we're obviously \u2013 we're behind where we had hoped to be. And the supply/demand imbalance has not resolved itself yet. And we could be looking at another year or two before that's completely resolved, and that's a function really of the soft growth primarily outside the U.S. on the demand side at this point. Now, as far as integration goes, we made, I think great progress on the integration of those businesses. We're focused on new products in sort of other markets that we haven't played in as much, particularly on the film side, and we're getting some traction there, and we've built up our international capability, it's allowing us to do well, particularly in Asia. So we're encouraged by that. But in the short-term, we're obviously behind where we thought we would be. Christopher D. Glynn: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Jason Ursaner of CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jason M. Ursaner: Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Hey Jason. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Jason M. Ursaner: I had a little trouble connecting and missed some of the notes around each segment. Organic growth and the order rates, obviously extremely strong, just wondering maybe if you could walk through which divisions in the Tech segment were driving that in the 12-week orders? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. It's pretty much across the \u2013 across the board. So if you look at \u2013 and the electronics part of the business is doing well in wireless, but also in more traditional advanced packaging applications have started to pick up. And if you look at some of the Gartner data, it's encouraging in that area. But also auto electronics has been strong. And then, outside of the electronics space, a lot of general industry applications that would affect our EFD business are strong. We have a bunch of new products coming into play across our EFD business as well as our systems business. And then the medical businesses aren't really well \u2013 really driven by the broadening of our product line, and some international growth now as well. So really across the board, that looks very encouraging at the moment. Jason M. Ursaner: Okay. And the traditional PC market, I know that, yeah, it's been a struggle, but came back to growth \u2013 at least in global numbers, and especially in the domestic market. Have you seen any of that translate in some of the more, I guess legacy applications in PC and server? Michael F. Hilton: Yes. We are seeing that, my comment on advanced packaging is directly related to PC, desktop, server kind of applications, both with end users and then sort of the outsourced manufacturers, we saw some encouraging orders coming through. So we're certainly starting to see that. Jason M. Ursaner: Okay. And the investments you've been making in Tech, just any update on kind of where those stand, and any success on the curing side issue (35:15)? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So we have, on the wafer project we launched, we picked up our second big order in that business, and we have probably more than 10 significant prospects that we expect to see signed this year. So we're getting good \u2013 I think good traction on that. We're also taking advantage of expanding our local China manufacturing applications, and we have a number of new products across the \u2013 that particular systems base that we're introducing this year that we are seeing some good traction, and so it's encouraging at this point. Jason M. Ursaner: Okay, I appreciate the commentary, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. Jason A. Rodgers: Yes, I was wondering if you can give an update on the Freedom and Liberty systems and how that \u2013 how they play into your forecast for strong second half of the year? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, we've had an uptick on both of those products in the last couple of quarters. I think what we used to characterize last year is probably revenue exceeded expectations, volume didn't quite exceed expectations. I think that is continuing, but we have seen an uptick. The one we issue we mentioned was the availability of new adhesives that would further enhance the benefit of those particular new products has really not come to market yet. And some of the things going on in the oil industry right now, and the supply chain probably delayed that a little bit further, but they're clearly, Freedom is top of the line, Liberty is sort of our next tiered position and we have a number of other tiered positions. So we feel pretty good about what we have to offer broadly, and then we've only recently started to offer those products in Asia. So I'd say, we're at expectations on those products, not accelerating the way we might have hoped, based on the availability of the adhesives. Jason A. Rodgers: And Greg, the pension settlement expense that you have in your press release, is that included in the selling and admin line of the income statement? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah, that is \u2013 in the segment detail, that's in corporate spending. Jason A. Rodgers: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Walter Liptak of Global Hunter. Your line is open. Walter Scott Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Walt. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Walter Scott Liptak : I wanted to ask about the coatings business, very strong orders there and this is the third quarter that we've seen of the strong order trend, and as I think back, through the past we've seen periods like this before, where you kind of take on a couple of quarters of increasing orders, and then my recollection is that, then it starts to slow down again. So I guess, I'd like to get some color on what's driving it, what the visibility looks like as we go further into 2015? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, so of course, Walt. Yeah. So I would say, obviously the business itself is linked to the business cycle, and that's, I think, what you're referring to in your comments. That said, there are a number of markets that have been strong, so auto for example is one that's been strong for us. With some of our, cold materials acquisition in the Sealant Equipment business, we've been able to take that \u2013 now starting to take that internationally, we're seeing some uptick there. And we've talked about in the past \u2013 oil and gas exploration, and what that's doing from pipe coating application, pipe coating. So I would say solid, but even in businesses that are more traditional like our container business, we're seeing good order growth, some of that is upgrades and recapitalization, which new technology helps. So I'd say, generally it's fairly broad-based, I'd say the areas that are still a little bit \u2013 a little bit slow would be the things like coatings for recreational products, for some office furniture, things like appliances kind of go up and down a little bit, but they're generally solid. So, I'd say the key drivers are the ones, that I've talked about here, and we've got as you look at the orders, some pretty good visibility, and \u2013 at least in the near-term. And when we look at our projects list, really across the globe, we see some pretty good activity. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay, great. It sounds good. And then just a general one on currency. Is there any fundamental impact on currency like, are you any less competitive in any markets because of the stronger dollar? Michael F. Hilton: No. If you look at \u2013 we're pretty well distributed from a supply chain standpoint, so it's really the translation impacts that you're looking at there. So no, we're not seeing any significant competitive threats there. But the degree of change particularly in Europe in the end, and to a lesser extent, the pound has impacted the translation effect, but we're not seeing a competitive dynamic given the balance in our supply chain. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in queue at this time. Would you like to close with any closing remarks? James R. Jaye: Yes. This is Jim again. Thank you, everybody for joining the call. I do have some calls scheduled with some of you later today, I'm around, and I'll be around tomorrow as well to take your call. So again, thank you. And I appreciate your ongoing interest in Nordson. Have a good day. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. James R. Jaye: Thank you, and good morning. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson's Director of Investor Relations. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, May 20, 2015, Nordson's FY 2015 second quarter results and third quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until May 27, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 38836001. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our fiscal year 2015 second quarter results and a bit about our third quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending Nordson's 2015 second quarter conference call. The Nordson team continued to execute and deliver a solid quarter in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Sales, operating margin, and earnings per share were within our range of expectations. As we anticipated, negative currency translation compared to the same period a year ago was a significant headwind in the quarter, where sales and EPS were negatively impacted by $32 million and $0.15, respectively, compared to the second quarter last year. We gained momentum sequentially as the top line grew by 6% and operating margin improved by 2 percentage points compared to the first quarter of this year. We leveraged the increased revenue to deliver incremental margin of 63%. Looking ahead, we're forecasting a very good start to the second half of our year. Our current backlog, order rates and project activity are solid. And the midpoint of our third quarter outlook calls for organic growth of 8%, an excellent level in a macroeconomic environment that continues to be challenging. I'll speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our third quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sales in the quarter were $401 million, a decrease of 4% from the prior year's second quarter. This change in sales included a 1% increase in organic volume, a 3% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions, and an 8% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume decreased 2% as compared to the prior year second quarter. Organic growth was solid in product lines serving disposable hygiene, general product assembly, rigid packaging and injection molding end markets. We continued to see softness in extrusion and polymer compounding and pelletizing end markets. Organic volume growth in Europe and Japan was offset by softness in other regions. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 5% from the prior year second quarter, where organic volume decreased 4%, and the first year effect of acquisitions added 9%. In electronic end markets, strong organic growth for test and inspection solutions was offset by lower demand for automated dispensing systems. Growth for fluid management components serving medical and industrial end markets also was solid. Geographically, organic volume growth in the U.S., the Americas, and Japan was offset by softness in other regions. Sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 23% compared to the second quarter a year ago. Organic growth was positive in most product lines driven by projects in consumer durable, automotive, industrial and container end markets. The organic growth was broad-based with double-digit growth in all regions except Asia-Pacific as compared to the same period a year ago. Gross margin for the total company in the second quarter was 55%. At prior year currency rates, gross margin would be 56% in the quarter, equal to the level delivered in the prior year second quarter. Operating profit in the quarter was $76 million, and operating margin was 19%. Currency negatively impacted operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points, compared to the second quarter a year ago. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 25% in the current quarter. Excluding the effects of currency as compared to the prior year, operating margin was 27%. Within the Advanced Technology segment, operating margin was 19% in the second quarter, lower than the level of a year ago due to negative leverage on lower organic volume and the impact of currency, where operating margin performance for this segment was also negatively impacted by about 1% due to the stronger dollar as compared to the prior year. In the Industrial Coating segment, operating margin was 17% in the second quarter or 19%, excluding the negative impact of currency as compared to the prior year. This level of operating margin is an increase on both a sequential and year-over-year basis and reflects the strong operating leverage generated by this business on higher volume. Continuing down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31% and was impacted by currency and jurisdictional mix of income. Net income for the quarter was $49 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80. As in previous quarters, we've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one-time items. The current quarter's EBITDA was $92 million, down 14% as compared to the same period a year ago, due primarily to unfavorable currency. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $92 million, and free cash flow before dividends was $72 million, reflecting strong cash conversion of 147% of net income as we have trended back to our typical days sales outstanding level. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. We continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter, distributing approximately $13 million in dividends and investing $66 million for the repurchase of shares. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very liquid with net-debt-to-EBITDA at just under 2 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the second quarter. I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with the Avalon and Dima acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending May 10, 2015, order rates are up 3% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. As we've noted in the past, order growth rates can fluctuate from week-to-week. And for most of this fiscal year, 12-week order growth rates on a currency neutral basis have been much stronger as compared to the prior year, such as our backlog, excluding acquisitions, at the end of the second quarter is up 23% over the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders were up 8% as compared to the same period in the prior year, where we generated order growth in most product lines. Disposable hygiene, rigid packaging and plastic pelletizing and compounding drove this growth. Current orders do contain a large project related to pelletizing that is not expected to ship in our current fiscal year. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are down 10%, compared to the same period in the prior year. Strength in surface treatment systems for electronics and fluid management components for medical end markets was offset by softness in other product lines, where we do face somewhat challenging comparisons against the prior year. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 21% as compared to the prior year. Order rates were strong across nearly all product lines. Backlog at April 30, 2015 was approximately $287 million, an increase of 26% compared to April 30, 2014, inclusive of 23% organic growth and 3% growth due to the Avalon and Dima acquisitions. Current backlog increased 25%, compared to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015. These backlog amounts are calculated at April 30, 2015 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 2% to 6%, as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of 6% to 10%. 2% growth from the first year effective acquisitions and a negative 6% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation based on current exchange rates. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect third quarter gross margin to be 55% and operating margin is forecasted to be 24% with both negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point due to unfavorable currency rates as compared to the prior year. We're estimating third quarter interest expense of about $4.4 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30% resulting in third quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.19 to $1.30 per share. I'll add some data points for the rest of the year that may be helpful. For the second half of the year, we're forecasting an effective tax rate excluding discrete items to be about 30% based on current tax law. We also expect normal maintenance capital spending for the full year to be between $45 million to $50 million. In addition, we invested $15 million during the first half of the year for the construction of our new and previously described fluid management facility in Colorado. We anticipate additional capital expenditures of approximately $5 million on this project over the rest of the year. And the facility is targeted to begin operations during our third quarter where we will then exit a leased facility. To add a few additional comments related to currency, assuming exchange rates for the rest of fiscal 2015 remain where they are today, we expect currency translation to negatively impact full year sales by about 6%. In summary, we delivered a solid second quarter in line with our expectations and against the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. Our current backlog order rates and project activity lead us to forecast a strong third quarter. With that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First, I want to thank our global team again for their hard work. Our employees delivered a solid first half performance in a challenging economy. Their dedication and commitment to our customers continues to be a competitive advantage for Nordson. In terms of our outlook, as Greg mentioned, we're expecting about 8% organic growth in the third quarter compared to last year. And 24% operating margin at the midpoint of our guidance. This is terrific performance given the state of the global microenvironment. In our comments last quarter, we spoke about a number of large dollar projects involving several customers across multiple lines of business, has shaped our expectations for the second half of 2015. Several of these projects converted to orders during this quarter and will benefit sales in the second half of the year. Relative to previous full-year commentary, a unique application that we expected would translate into a significant order did not materialize. Changes in customer requirements, initiated by the customer during the final stages of the project, resulted in a reduction in the customers' forecasted demand for Nordson equipment. So, while we're not able to give a specific forecast beyond the quarter, further clarity around the scope of these large dollar opportunities leads us to moderate our full year view, such that we anticipate organic growth to be in the mid-single digit range for the year. Again, relative to the weak macroeconomic environment we're operating in, this is strong performance and puts Nordson on pace for another excellent year. In addition to growing the top line, our team remains focused on other strategic priorities, accelerating innovation in both products and process, pursuing acquisitive growth in our prioritized spaces, further optimizing the organization through Nordson's business system and building our bench strength through talent management and development initiatives. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are sound and we expect to continue to driving excellent results for the shareholders over the long term. At this time, let me turn to your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open. Liam D. Burke: Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Liam. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Liam D. Burke: Mike, could you give us a little color on the polymer business by geography? It sounds like the pelletizing is coming back with a large order. But in terms of extrusion, how is that business going, and is one geography doing better than another? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I'd tell you, in general, if you look at the injection molding side, still very solid. I'd say if you look at the film side, particularly the high-end films, we're still dealing with the overcapacity situation. I'd say year-on-year, pelletizing is improving, the crayon board (16:50) business is improving relative to tough comps for last year. I'd say the one thing that we are seeing that's limiting, I'd say, U.S. growth in the business in general is the currency is impacting some of the U.S. OEMs from a competitive standpoint. For us, that may just shift the business somewhere else to Europe or Asia. But in the short term, that's having a bit of an impact. But generally, injection is solid and the extrusion is still relatively soft. Liam D. Burke: Great. And on the ATS business, it sounds like medical is still providing the growth. Is that continuing? Are you seeing consistent growth out of that segment? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. We're very pleased with what we're seeing on the medical side across the three broad product areas that we have nice growth. We expect that business to continue to be a double-digit kind of growth and we're seeing that. So, we can't get our new facility up and running as fast as we can to support that growth. Liam D. Burke: Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. John E. Franzreb: Good morning, everyone. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. John E. Franzreb: Mike, just on this unique application that essentially didn't materialize, a couple of questions. One, it sounds like you had a high degree of confidence that was going to come in, but the customer \u2013 it sounds like some of these are not deferring it, but literally changed its plans. Can you give us a little color of what happened that made them change their entire strategy? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. What I would say is we work with this customer and other significant customers in a lot of development projects and activities. And in this particular case, we were well down the path of gearing up our manufacturing operations and our engineering and service and support to meet the demand, but they also continued to look for other innovative approaches to meet their same needs. In this particular example, they were able to find another way that for them required less of our equipment. So, it's not a loss to a competitor or anything like that. It's just they found a different way of doing that, discussed where we worked with on other applications and there's some new ones that are coming into to play as well. But it's just \u2013 we got pretty far down the path to the point where we were gearing up our manufacturing, engineering and service organization to support it. So, that led us to be pretty confident in that particular project. John E. Franzreb: So, is there some costs that you don't expect to get back from this project, or do you think that it's transferable to other applications, you're just going to have to reposition it a little bit? Michael F. Hilton: The latter, John. Yeah. It's not \u2013 we are very good at moving up and down to support our customers' requirements in all of our businesses. As customers have pushed us to reduce lead times, we've got pretty adept at how we can move up and down. And so, no, there's no significant cost hid here. We just redirect the effort. John E. Franzreb: Okay. And one last question, I'll get back into queue. How much of your backlog is deliverable in 2015? Michael F. Hilton: I'd say most of it is deliverable in 2015. John E. Franzreb: The fiscal year, I'm sorry? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I'd say most of it is deliverable in 2015. I think we've talked about in the past, there are sometimes in a variety of areas, it could be our coatings business, it could be in product assembly, certainly in the pelletizer business where you have either longer lead times or customers asking you to stage orders. And so, we've got one in particular on the pelletizer side that is probably a next year order just given the scope and size of it. John E. Franzreb: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll get back into queue. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: On the order front, could you just give us a sense on how they trended throughout the quarter? I mean, did they get stronger that's giving you a little bit more confidence in the back half? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I would say, if you look at year-on-year comparisons, they were strong and well above last year I think, as Greg mentioned in his comments, till probably the last couple of weeks. That's not necessarily saying the level of the orders are decreasing. It's just that on a year-on-year comparison, we had a pretty significant step-up in this point last year in the seasonal pattern of our business. And we do expect orders to continue to pick up, albeit against tough comps over the next six weeks to 10 weeks or so. But we do expect across the businesses based on what we see from a project activity that to pick up. But I'd say it's really been the last couple of weeks where timing on some of this has kind of hit the \u2013 a little bit tougher comps from last year. But if you kind of looked area under the curve, it's been strong really for the whole year to this point. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Okay. And then just touching on acquisitions, could you just give us any color on the environment, kind of sizes of the things that you're looking at today? It's, obviously, giving you nice free cash flow and leverage ratio at the time. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. I'm having a little trouble hearing you, but I think you're asking about sort of the M&A environment, then I would say, we still have a strong project list out there. I think as we've talked before, you can never really control the timing. I think we also indicated there's likely to be sort of more smaller tuck-in product line opportunities this year. I'd say from the environment standpoint, with financing costs as cheap as they are, things still are going for a relative premium, and we know what makes sense for us and we know where we can deliver synergies, and that factors into our analysis of any particular project. That's, obviously, assuming it is across the strategic hurdle that it fits into one of our four priorities. But I'd say it's still a pretty robust marketplace out there from a seller's perspective. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Joe K. Radigan: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Joe. Joe K. Radigan: A couple of questions on Advanced Tech. Mike, were you surprised by the organic revenue decline there this quarter? I know you've talked about some longer lead time projects and some phasing of orders, but the delta between the strong order growth last quarter and the revenue performance this quarter seems a little more drastic than typical. Michael F. Hilton: No. I would say it really comes down to timing. A lot of this is impacted on the systems side by timing of some of the mobile product and market launches and so forth. And so I would say the first quarter was a little stronger than we typically see. I'd say the second quarter was at a reasonably high level, but year-on-year maybe a little softer. If you recall, last year we had a big step-up in the third and fourth quarter in the segment. And we expect to see the third and fourth quarter improve as well. So, no, not a big surprise because we can't always control the timing. Our customers really drive that. What I would say is we have in that segment a number of new products that are coming out. We've talked in the past about our new sort of front-end X-ray system. We got our third order there. We have some new prospects there. And, in general, our X-ray business with the new products are taking off. With Dima in the fold, we're launching our mid-tier product. We've gotten some orders from the sort of local Chinese mobile guys, although they're way down the curve in terms of sophistication relative to the global leaders. So I would say the thing we can't control is sort of the timing. I think we got good activity and development projects with key customers. And then, if you look outside of the systems part of the business, the general EFD-type applications are doing reasonably well and the medical business is going very strong. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. Great. And then you sort of touched on my follow-up question, but, I mean, you do have very challenging growth comps in the back half of the year, in the third quarter and fourth quarter. So given the decline in orders you saw this quarter, the 10% decline, is your growth expectation supported by the backlog? Or is this more of kind of to what you alluded to earlier and what Greg alluded to in terms of you have sort of an anomaly in sort of the growth rate because you had a strong order week falloff and get replaced by a weaker order week? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So it's kind of a little bit of both. So, obviously, the backlog is very strong because the prior orders through the quarter \u2013 for most of the quarter were really strong. So a lot of that business will be delivered in the third quarter. And then, when we look at the project activity across all of the businesses, we see solid project activity, and we expect a number of those things to come through, so we expect orders to pick up. We do have a challenging comp. We are expecting the second half of the year to exceed what we expect \u2013 what we saw last year even on that challenging comp. So I think our project activity is something that impacts probably later Q3 and Q4, and the big backlog we have, a lot of which will be delivered in Q3, gives us confidence in the Q3 expectations. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Ursaner with CJS Securities. Your line is open. Jason M. Ursaner: Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Jason. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Jason. Jason M. Ursaner: Just going back to the large project for a second where the customer went with a different approach. What end market was that going to? Michael F. Hilton: I don't think we really want to kind of pinpoint that. But, from time-to-time, we have this across each of our businesses where we could have large projects that have an impact and sometimes that distorts things locally. But it's customer that we have continuing other projects with, we have new application work that we're doing with them. This was a sizable project that just didn't go through at the last minute. Jason M. Ursaner: Okay. And in terms of the overall second half outlook, relative to what you had said last quarter about resuming organic growth in a double-digit range versus now, it's on the more mid single-digit. Is that project alone kind of adding up to that or this is a handful of things? Michael F. Hilton: I would say that project is a significant part of that adjustment. I think if we look at the rest of the businesses and look at the geographies around the globe, we feel pretty good about where we're at. Particularly given a soft start to the year, I think if you look at where China is and what they're trying to do in general, we're starting to see things pick up there, geographically. So I would say that was a significant part of where we thought we're going to be for the year. And everything else looks pretty reasonable and even some of the areas that geographically you might be concerned about, like where China was early in the year, that's picking up. And Europe is looking more encouraging. The U.S., we'll have to see, this first quarter was just an anomaly, but we do expect things to pick up there as well. Jason M. Ursaner: Okay. Sounds good. Appreciate it, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Charley Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is actually Patrick (29:47) standing in for Charley. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Good morning. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. Just wanted to go to the Adhesive side. Last quarter's orders were 6%, it was pretty good. And then, I guess, this quarter 8% is even better. But that didn't really translate into sales. Were the 6% growth in orders last quarter also long-term like you just mentioned for this quarter? I sort of recall that it was more on the short side, but please correct me if I'm mistaken here. Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah. This is Greg here. As you mentioned, both quarters were reasonably strong for that segment order growth rates. And the last quarter did have some project activity as well in those order rates that were going to benefit the second half of the year. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And I guess, just want to parse out the organic growth for that Adhesive side of the business. What is your expectation for the third quarter? Is it higher or lower than, I guess, the organic growth rate number that you put out there? Is that going to be, I guess, beneficial, maybe detrimental to that number? Gregory A. Thaxton: So the order rates that we're seeing around 8%, and then obviously, that factors in to our overall outlook, and the midpoint of our outlook was also around 8%. So that's a significant contributor to it. The one order that \u2013 there's a one large pelletizer order that we said was it going to be in longer lead time that's going to fall into early next year. So, that is \u2013 part of that 8% that won't necessarily come in in third or fourth quarter, but the business in general looks pretty solid there. And we're expecting solid growth in the third quarter, and some of the areas geographically that were a little slower to start have picked up. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's perfect. And just one quick question on Asia-Pacific. Obviously, the reason I \u2013 actually you had a pretty good couple of quarters in terms of spot sales and orders and that really bucked the trend a little bit this quarter. Can you add a little more color there? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I would say \u2013 if you look around Asia and if you look at Japan, for example, we had a solid quarter this quarter. But from an order standpoint, it's a little bit softer. And it's a mix across businesses, and we do expect that to pick up and close out the year stronger. I'd say, similarly, if you'll look at Asia-Pacific, it's some mix of mobile business, some mix of other parts of our business like, for example, in China, things like beer and beverage packaging business is pretty soft, but starting to pick up again. So, I'd say China, in general, is probably the one area that was off to a softer start this year that now has really started to pick back up, and obviously there's a lot of activity at the government level to help to continue to drive the growth in that economy. And we see that picking up throughout the rest of the year. Gregory A. Thaxton: And this is Greg. Just to add another comment. Some of this relates to the timing of orders and specifically in our Advanced Technology segment where there's a large customer base in Asia-Pacific. If you go back to last quarter within Asia-Pacific, we were showing order growth of 46%, and this quarter, we're down 15%. A portion of that is the timing of when we're receiving some of those orders, combined with, as Mike mentioned earlier, we are reaching a point of more challenging comp. So, I think if you look over the last couple of quarters at how we're doing within Asia-Pacific, they kind of tie to Mike's comments. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. John E. Franzreb: Yeah. Just a follow-up on a previous question. I know you didn't want to identify the end market. But could you identify what segment you expected that unique order to fall into? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I don't know that we want to call that out either, John. We're not trying to be mysterious here. It's just that with a lot of our larger customers, we do a lot of things under confidentiality agreements. And I don't necessarily want to disclose that from both a customer and a competitor standpoint. So, I'd rather not comment. John E. Franzreb: Okay. Was there a significant amount of associated R&D spend related to this project that we could expect to drop off? Any color on the R&D front might be helpful. Michael F. Hilton: No. I wouldn't say that \u2013 as we called out sort of two years ago when we're working on a whole new sort of platform, the back \u2013 the front-end X-ray machines for the semiconductor side that was kind of a unique whole new market. This would fall under the category of our continuous development work with customers. So, I wouldn't \u2013 what we've developed is not something we can't use with them or others \u2013 other places. So, it's not kind of a unique new platform that we're trying to develop like the automated X-ray machine for solder bumps and TSV. John E. Franzreb: Right. Okay. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. John, just another couple of comments. So, this would have been more of a standard type product solution for us, which is the good news. And just getting back to your comment earlier on the costs that we may have occurred, as you likely know, for us, these volumes and meeting the demands of our customers are often just us putting more temporary labor in the factory to meet that demand. So, it's not that we incurred a lot of additional costs throughout the organization that we're going to be burdened with. John E. Franzreb: Perfect. And on Industrial Coatings, good year of your revenue growth, but the margin was kind of flattish year-over-year. Was that entirely due to currency or is there a mix issue going on also? Michael F. Hilton: Well, there's 2 percentage points, I think, Greg, called out that was currency. Gregory A. Thaxton: That's correct. Michael F. Hilton: So, that's pretty significant for 17% \u2013 I think, 17% would've been 19%, if not for the currency. So, that's pretty significant. From time-to-time, we do have mix, but I think far outweighed \u2013 the currency far outweighed anything in that. John E. Franzreb: Okay. Great. Thank you very much, Mike. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Amanda. And again, thank you, everybody, for joining our call. As always, I'll be available for questions throughout the day today and the rest of the week, and I look forward to talking with you. Everyone, enjoy your long holiday weekend. And we'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir. James R. Jaye: Thank you and good morning, Kevin. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson's Director of Investor Relations. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to welcome you to our conference call today, Friday, August 21, 2015, our Nordson's FY 2015 third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until August 28, 2015, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 98581161. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our FY 2015 third quarter results and a bit about our fourth quarter outlook. Mike, go ahead. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending Nordson's third quarter conference call. Nordson delivered organic growth of 6% during the quarter, a strong number in what continues to be challenging macroeconomic environment. Unfavorable currency translation continues to be a significant headwind on results compared to the same period a year ago as the dollar continued to strengthen during the quarter, resulting in a 7% negative impact on sales. Sales and earnings per share were negatively impacted by $33 million and $0.16 per share respectively compared to the third quarter of last year. From an operating perspective, we've leveraged sequential revenue growth to generate operating margin of 22% in the third quarter, an increase of three percentage points compared to the second quarter. We maintained our disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter, distributing $13 million in dividends and investing $49 million in share repurchases. We also acquired Liquidyn, a German manufacturer of micro-dispense valves, that will broaden our fluid management product offering and is a nice complement to our EFD product portfolio. We continued our ongoing focus on optimizing the business, taking restructuring actions within certain Advanced Technology segment product lines to enhance operational efficiency and provide customer service in a more cost-effective manner. This is among several actions we're taking now and over the coming year to protect and enhance our margins in 2016, where we expect the macroeconomic environment will continue to be soft. In terms of our fourth quarter outlook, the current macroeconomic environment and comparisons to the prior year are challenging, resulting in modest organic growth at the midpoint of our forecast. This outlook would result in full year organic growth of approximately 4%, a solid level given the state of the global economy, which we've seen soften as the year has progressed. I'll speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide more detailed commentary on our results and our fourth quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sales in the quarter were $463 million, an increase of 1% from the prior year third quarter. This change in sales included a 6% increase in organic volume, a 2% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions, and a 7% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. As Mike noted, the U.S. dollar further strengthened during the quarter, generating a stronger headwind of sales than we guided to back in May. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment organic sales volume increased 4% as compared to the prior year third quarter. Organic growth was solid in product lines serving disposable hygiene, general product assembly, rigid packaging and plastic extrusion end markets. We generated organic volume growth in all regions except the U.S. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 8% from the prior year third quarter, where organic volume increased 2% and the first year effect of acquisitions added 6%. And I'll remind you that the Advanced Technology segment had a very strong quarter last year where third quarter sales grew 15% over fiscal 2013 third quarter. So our comps are very challenging. In electronic systems end markets, organic growth was strong in surface treatment and test and inspection product lines, partially related to the penetration of new applications and customer adoption of new products. Demand for automated dispense systems was lower in comparison to the very strong period a year ago. Within fluid management product lines, medical end market demand continued to drive strong growth in single-use components. Geographically, total segment organic volume was strong in the U.S., Americas and Europe. Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coatings segment increased 23% compared to the third quarter a year ago. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong growth within this segment as our team captures the global opportunities presented within the end markets served. Organic growth increased by double-digits in all product lines and was driven by projects in consumer durable, automotive, industrial, container and electronics end markets, and growth was positive in all regions. Gross margin for the total company in the third quarter was 54%. As compared to the prior year, currency negatively impacted gross margin by 110 basis points and Advanced Technology product mix also reduced gross margin. Operating profit in the quarter was $103 million and operating margin was 22% or 24%, excluding the effects of currency, as compared to the prior year. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 26% in the current quarter or 28% excluding the effects of currency as compared to the prior year. Within the Advanced Technology segment, operating margin was 24% in the third quarter or 25%, excluding one-time items. The effects of currency as compared to the prior year were negligible as a high percentage of sales are U.S. dollar denominated. As noted previously, the prior year's third quarter was an exceptional quarter for this segment, both in terms of sales volume growth and the customer and product mix of volume sold, where we delivered margin of 32% in the quarter, a high watermark over the last couple of years for this segment. Comparing to a more normalized operating margin for this segment in the third quarter and fourth quarter of high 20%, operating margin in the quarter was negatively impacted by product line and customer mix, with a higher mix of non-automated dispense sales. The Industrial Coatings segment delivered operating margin of 19% in the third quarter or 21% excluding the effects of currency as compared to the prior year. This outstanding performance is an increase of six percentage points over the prior year and reflective of the strong operating leverage generated by this business on higher volume and our ongoing efforts to drive profitability. Continuing down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.5% or 30.1% excluding a discreet return to provision adjustment. Net income for the quarter was $69 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.14 or $1.16, excluding the $0.01 per share benefit related to the discrete tax items and a $0.03 per share charge related to restructuring and efficiency initiatives mentioned previously. As in previous quarters, we've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release, to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one-time items. The current quarter's EBITDA was $120 million, cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $50 million, and free cash flow before dividends was $37 million. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by an increase in working capital, mostly related to the timing of receivable collection and some inventory build. We expect free cash flow in the fourth quarter to benefit from a reduction in working capital, as we trend back to our typical DSI and DSO metrics. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. We continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter, distributing approximately $13 million in dividends, investing $49 million for the repurchase of shares and continuing to execute on our acquisition strategy. As of the end of our third quarter, we have approximately $147 million available against the $300 million share repurchase authorization. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very liquid with net debt to EBITDA at 2.1 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the third quarter. In terms of additional color on acquisition activity, we've recently completed two small acquisitions that add to our capabilities. On June 15, we completed the acquisition of Liquidyn, a German manufacturer of micro-dispensing systems, including micro-dispensing pneumatic valves, controllers and process equipment. Highly complementary to our existing portfolio, Liquidyn's products expand our jetting capabilities and are used to dispense adhesives, greases, silicones, oil, flux, lacquers, solder paste and other chemicals in the electronics, automobile, medical, packaging, furniture and aerospace industries. The company has 13 full-time employees and will be integrated into the Nordson EFD product line within the Advanced Technology Systems segment. While the transaction is not material and we're not disclosing specific financial information, the purchase price was approximately $15 million. After the close to the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of WAFO Produktions-GmbH, a German manufacturer of screws and barrels for plastic injection molding and extrusion applications. This purchase is in line with our global strategy and establishes a local European screw and barrel source to enable and support growth in that region. WAFO serves a diverse customer base, adds field engineering resources, and deepens and accelerates market penetration. The company has approximately 65 employees, and will be integrated into the polymer product line within the Adhesive Dispensing segment. Again, this transaction is not material and we are not disclosing specific financial information, the purchase price for WAFO was approximately $8 million. We're excited about the opportunities these two organizations bring to Nordson, and we welcome these new employees to the Nordson family. I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and a geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year, on a currency-neutral basis, and with the Liquidyn acquisition included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending August 16, 2015, order rates are up 5% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders were up 12% as compared to the same period in the prior year, where we generated order growth in all product lines and all geographies except Japan. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 1% against the prior year. Strength in Automated Dispensing Systems for electronics markets and fluid management components for medical end markets was offset by other product lines. Strength in Asia-Pacific, Europe, and the Americas was offset by other regions. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are down 9%. We are facing challenging comparisons within this segment, where order rates were up 18% at this time last year. Growth in automotive and liquid painting product lines was offset by other product lines. Strength in Europe and the Americas was offset by other regions. Backlog at July 31, 2015 was approximately $270 million, an increase of 10% compared to July 31 of 2014, inclusive of 6% organic growth and 4% growth due to acquisitions. Current backlog decreased 5% compared to the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2015. These backlog amounts are calculated at July 31, 2015 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We're forecasting sales to be in the range of down 3% to down 7%, as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic volume growth of down 1% to up 3%, 1% growth from the first year effective acquisitions, and a negative 7% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation based on current exchange rates. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect fourth quarter gross margin to be 55% and operating margin is estimated to be approximately 22%, with both negatively impacted by one percentage point due to unfavorable currency rates as compared to the prior year. We're estimating fourth quarter interest expense of about $4.4 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30%, resulting in fourth quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.12 per share, inclusive of a $0.01 per share charge associated with purchase accounting for acquired inventory. We do expect strong cash conversion during the fourth quarter given the expected return to more typical working capital metrics previously noted. Such then on a full year cash conversion ratio, we expect to be close to 100%. In summary, we delivered strong organic growth in the third quarter against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop, while also continuing our balanced approach to capital deployment. Our fourth quarter outlook reflects continued softness in the macroeconomic environment and challenging comparisons to the prior year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First, I want to thank our global team for their hard work. Our employees have delivered solid performance over the first nine months of the year in a challenging environment. They are the secret of our success. In terms of our fourth quarter guidance, organic growth is positive at the midpoint of our forecast, even in a soft macroeconomic environment and challenging comparisons as Greg noted. At this midpoint, Nordson would deliver a full-year organic growth of approximately 4%, a solid number and well above global GDP. Looking further ahead, many economists at this time are not forecasting significant macroeconomic improvement heading into the coming year, and our own visibility over the longer term is limited. Given this uncertain outlook, we are taking actions in areas we can control to improve normalized operating margin in 2016 and beyond, independent of sales volume leverage. The actions taken in the third quarter to optimize the performance of our Advanced Technology segment are among the first of these steps. These actions were taken in conjunction with the opening of our new facility in Colorado, and the acquisition of Liquidyn, which provided us with opportunities to further optimize customer service and operational footprint across selected fluid management product lines. Using tools within the Nordson business system, we are implementing a more concentrated effort around multiple continuous improvement initiatives, accelerating footprint consolidation activities, challenging the productivity of our organization, while limiting additions to head count and reducing other spending categories. We will have more detail around these activities in the coming quarters as they occur. Overall, our target is an improvement of at least 200 basis points for the normalized operating margin by 2017, with some of this coming in 2016, again independent of sales volume leverage. While we do expect to grow the top line of the business beyond GDP levels, which does then generate solid volume leverage, our focus will be on improving operating performance levels of each of the segments against the assumption of a low-growth environment. Overall, our global team is committed to providing a best-in-class experience to our customers and delivering solid long-term returns to our shareholders. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to capitalize on many of the opportunities available to us in the diverse end markets we serve. At this time, let me turn it over to your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Kevin Maczka with BB&T. Kevin R. Maczka: Thanks, good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning Kevin. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Kevin R. Maczka: So the first question I guess, kind of a big picture demand, I know visibility is always limited here, but as we're approaching fiscal 2016, I guess my interpretation here is that, we're going to do about 4% organic growth this year, but it sounds like maybe you're bracing for a bigger slowdown, given your comments about visibility and uncertainty and soft macro and taking new cost tax. Is that the right way to be thinking about 2016? Michael F. Hilton: No, Kevin, I wouldn't \u2013 here's how I would characterize it. If you think about where we were at the beginning of our year looking at the global macroeconomy, most economists were forecasting well above 3% GDP growth. And quite frankly, based on where we sit today, the only geographic region that has hit that is Europe. U.S is below where things were expected, Japan, China, most of Asia, and emerging markets are below, so that we see this year's GDP coming in in that 2% to 2.5%, likely middle, 2.2%, 2.3%. Our view is next year, that's probably going to be the same. There are some economists now that still show 3% for next year. We don't see a catalyst at the moment that's going to drive more global GDP growth well above 3%. So we're looking at it more like this year. So if you think about, rough rule of thumb of kind of 2x the GDP that we see, that's kind of our expectation. That's not the most robust growth environment, and so, we think, it's only prudent to go into the year, being watchful of our expense line, driving our productivity initiatives, and maybe accelerating some of the programs we had in the plan already. Gregory A. Thaxton: And Kevin, this is Greg. What I'd add to those comments is, we certainly have other initiatives including new product development initiatives, new market opportunity initiatives that help us have aspirations of driving above that two times GDP, and historically, we've been able to capture some of that. But it's the sense that the operating environment next year may not be much better than what we're operating in this year. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I'd say just add to that, the initiative \u2013 from an initiative standpoint, we're doing pretty well this year. We're just floating on a little bit weaker economy than we expected. Kevin R. Maczka: Yeah. And I think 6% in the quarter and 4% for the year is certainly better than most industrials this year. So that looks good on a relative basis and in a soft GDP world, but I'm just, I guess, where I'm going is, I'm just wondering, where do you see the opportunity for things to accelerate? If we do have a similar GDP environment and who knows, it \u2013 maybe it's worse, maybe it's better. But if it's similar like you're forecasting, what would make us to do better than 4%? Is it new product development and some of the new initiatives you have, Greg? Or is there something specific to your segments or your geographies that gives you some comfort that things can be better? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah, Kevin. I would say a lot of it is linked to the new products development side. We have a lot of new products that we've introduced this year, and I'd say generally getting traction, some of them are taking a little bit longer than we might have expected, but getting good feedback on those. So I think that is sort of a key opportunity. In some cases, we've got new applications that in effect, are creating demand, and so we're seeing some of that this year, and we expect to see some of that next year. So if you look at it, in each business we have initiatives that we think we can control, including in some cases, we've talked about in the past where we're making progress now in tiered products, for example in the Advanced Tech space that we haven't had before. So we see some of those kinds of things driving the sort of premium growth, even when the economy is a little bit softer than maybe folks had expected. So we're not discouraged, I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing in our initiatives. What is most unclear is, what are we floating on top of? And I'd say that's particularly unclear when you think about Asia, Japan, and China in particular. Kevin R. Maczka: Okay. Got it. I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Joe K. Radigan: Hey, good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Joe. Joe K. Radigan: First, on the fourth quarter guidance, can you give some directional color by segment and context of the organic growth guidance you provided? Adhesive Dispensing has been trending kind of below where the order growth has been. It would seem to indicate Advanced Tech and Industrial Coatings are both facing pretty tough double-digit organic growth comp. So, is it reasonable to expect Adhesives to come in at or above the high end of that range, and then the other segments kind of below or near the bottom of that range, or how are you thinking about it in terms of \u2013 relative to the total company? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, one thing that's a little bit different on the Adhesives side here is with the polymer product lines in there, some of those that are a little bit longer deliveries. So, some of the orders that we're seeing now, probably don't get shipped in the fourth quarter, would carry over into the first quarter. So I think generally speaking, if you look at it, until we kind of lap all of that and get a sort of a more normalized set of history with that business in, we're going to see some disconnection between orders and what you see in revenues. So, I think some of that \u2013 but that's certainly gone on a little bit in the Adhesives side of things. If you look at the rest of the business, we are entering the period of time where you typically would expect orders to follow a more typical pattern, which would be to a drop off from their peaks going forward, and that's what we anticipate to see, is typical traditional background going forward there. And so, that's kind of factored in against, as you said, the tough comps in \u2013 particularly in the Coatings business and also, in parts of the Advanced Technology business. Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah, Joe, this is Greg. And I think, just to add to what Mike said is, you hit a lot of it the prelude to your question. If you look at prior year revenue in each of the segments and kind of correlate that with current period growth rates, it helps give you a view of given the current pace of orders and the comps that were up again, you can kind of correlate where you might expect to see that growth rate coming in the fourth quarter. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. Great. And then, in Advanced Tech, do you expect the operating margin to moderate sequentially kind of on lower volume in the fourth quarter in line with what you typically see seasonally? I know you're going to have FX headwind again in the fourth quarter which will impact that margin, or does some of the restructuring benefits that you're going to get from the actions you've taken kind of offset that? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I'd say the restructuring benefits are mainly going to be things that we see next year. We're really not going to see much, I don't think in the fourth quarter. With regard to the operating margin in the Advanced Tech segment, I think, Greg tried to point out that we had a really unusual third quarter last year and that kind of distorted things. If you recall, last year in that segment, the first two quarters are pretty soft, we had a big concentration of orders in the third quarter, such that the other volumes were really strong and that had an impact in terms of volume leverage in that quarter, and then it moved back to a more traditional approach and I think we \u2013 what we see this year is the same kind of improvement in the third quarter, but not to the same level or the same peak. Joe K. Radigan: Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher D. Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Chris. Christopher D. Glynn: So, at ADS, the orders number is really truly striking in this global economic environment, and the adjusted for FX operating margin looks like it's hard getting back to some of the pre-plastics days as well. Are you finally seeing a pivot in that extrusion end market? Michael F. Hilton: I would say, the orders in general in the plastics product lines are up nicely. I would say, what we're seeing right now is more capability build in that extrusion segment, sort of newer technology for capability, not for capacity. So I would say, not yet in terms of that turn on the capacity side. But we are seeing upgrades, we're seeing rebuilds, we're seeing capability enhancement on the extrusion side, and we're seeing continued solid business in the injection side, but no, we haven't seen the \u2013 in particular, we haven't seen the high-end buy X (30:14) turn yet. Christopher D. Glynn: Okay. And then, I know it's been covered, but on the ATS margin pressure year-over-year, despite a little bit of organic growth, just \u2013 the magnitude's a little tough to comprehend. I know you've addressed it qualitatively, but if we could just kind of revisit that topic, I think it would help. Michael F. Hilton: Sure. Yeah. Let me take a stab at that, and then Greg can comment if he wants to add additional color. So we would expect in a normal quarter, or third quarter and typically, fourth quarter as well, but the third quarter in particular, to see kind of a high-20%s margin in that segment. So 32% last year, is probably three points or four points above what was typical. And that's really a function of the concentration of when the volume came in the last year. At the end, look at the sort of 24% this year, you've got one percentage point, that's the restructuring impact. And then there are three percentage points that are \u2013 or so, three percentage points to four percentage points that are linked to mix. When we say mix, basically our surface treating products and our test inspection products were up, a lot of that based on some new applications and new products. But our dispense volume was down significantly. And if you look at the \u2013 just the margins, by the nature of the scope of what we supply, and the markets those products are going into, you've got that sort of margin swing there that's having an impact. We're not seeing any pricing pressure, we're not losing any share, and you know that it's just a pretty significant swing in the mix that's had an impact there. Christopher D. Glynn: And what's the foreground for orders and projects on the automated side, even from a touchy feely perspective of answering? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, I would say, we're seeing improvement in the dispense side of things relative to where we were last year, but year-over-year, it's likely not be as strong as last year. And if I look at where we were, say a quarter ago, we expected there were some signals that were showing more traditional applications picking up, and that didn't play out throughout the rest of the quarter. And I'd say from a mobile perspective, we've seen a couple of things, we've seen mix change in our customers. So growth in the sort of Chinese-based customers, who today are buying some equipment but not to the same extent that others would, has a sort of a key impact there as well. So those are a couple of things that kind of impacted the dispense business. And this is the year where we've seen more modest change in the sort of features and functions of phones in general. And so typically, when there is a more dramatic change, we'll see more of an uptick. But we are seeing in the most recent orders, a nice positive impact on the dispense side of things. But in general, for the year, it's probably not going to be where we would have hoped coming into the year. Christopher D. Glynn: Thanks. It's very interesting. Operator : Our next question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company. John E. Franzreb: Yeah, I just like to \u2013 maybe stick a little bit... Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. John E. Franzreb: Good morning. Just stick a little bit on, maybe the consumer nondurable side of the business. Can you talk a little bit about regional differences you may be seeing in order patterns that maybe you should be cognizant of? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah, I would \u2013 so, a lot of the consumer nondurables fit within our Adhesives business. And if you look at the sort of the at the Adhesives business in general, the nonwovens part of the business has been pretty strong, the product assembly part of the business has been pretty strong. I'd say, packaging has been solid, with the exception of parts of Asia, and particularly China has been relatively soft year-over-year in the packaging area. So that's I think really a function of what you're seeing in the Chinese economy growth, but not robust growth. But everywhere else, it's been pretty solid. You can have some variations quarter to quarter based on large projects, but it's been a strong nonwovens year, it's been a strong product assembly year and a solid packaging year with the exception of overseeing in Asia, Japan softening and China being softer. And we're starting to see a pickup now in the plastic side of the business. John E. Franzreb: Mike, now that the Asian as well as China demand, has that weakened in recent months or has it been weak through the balance of the year? Michael F. Hilton: I would say, China in particular, started off weak, picked up and then kind of flattened out. So I would say, we're seeing a flattening in China, where we probably had expectations that China was going to pick up a little bit more. If you look at things like beer and beverage consumption and some other consumer products, they've been pretty weak in China, if you just look at sort of some of the other headlines. And part of that's linked to struggles with the transition to the consumption-based economy that they're having, which is really contributing to challenges meeting their GDP target. And that's one area where we see it playing out. John E. Franzreb: Okay. And Greg, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the inventory bills you referenced earlier and the receivable collections? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah. I think it's \u2013 we have this kind of phenomena at the end of our second quarter, which generally our revenues are pretty consistent throughout the quarter. And at the end of the second quarter, we just had a lot of volume that went out late in the quarter that impacted our DSO metrics and we had a very strong than third quarter \u2013 I am sorry, I'm a quarter off here, we had a very strong collection in the following quarter. I expect the same trends to continue where, during the third quarter, we saw a heavy mix of revenue shipping later in the quarter. And I think we've got a bit of the same on the inventory, our DSI went up a couple days. But we're not pre-building a lot of inventory for volumes that are extending beyond next quarter shipment. So I expect to see the same trends will moderate back to typical DSI, DSO and our cash conversion will be strong in the fourth quarter. John E. Franzreb: Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys, good morning. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Just touching on \u2013 I know China sounds like it's a certainly not met expectation from your perspective. But any concerns about with the headlines we're seeing on the daily basis, customers are pushing out some of these projects that you're talking about working on and so forth at this point? Michael F. Hilton: I'd say, as a general statement, we're not seeing significant delays or push-outs. But I would say, in a couple of the areas where there a bigger ticket investments, so in, say for example, parts of our Industrial Coating area as an example, we are seeing some stretch in time between sort of bidding and decisions. So I'd say, in general, no, but in areas where it might be the higher capital decisions for customers we're seeing. We're hearing a little bit about push-outs, longer lead times, things like that. So, not so much in some of the shorter term decisions that would fall into other parts of the business. I'd also say that it probably has an impact in some of the more traditional electronics applications as well just as a consumer of those products that's not as robust as maybe we would have expected earlier in the year. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Sure. And then just, it sounds like as we head into the 2016, there's really no sort of the catalyst for the change in the environment. Any changes or thoughts of changes to the capital deployment plan that you have in place today? Michael F. Hilton: So just to comment on the first part, I'd say, we're being prudent, so we would like to be surprised to the upside if things improve, but we're not seeing anything from an underlying macro standpoint that would dramatically change sort of the global economic environment there. I'd say, on the initiatives, we feel pretty good about our initiatives. From a capital deployment standpoint, I think our priorities would remain the same. We would look to increase our dividend. You noticed this year, we moderated in terms of the amount we increased it, in part because we're into the range that we would like to be in the sort of low 20%s. We would offset any kind of compensation-related share creep. We would look for acquisitions. We talked about two is really product line tuck-ins. We're seeing more of that kind of thing right now, and that's kind of tuck-ins or smaller acquisitions that we might have seen in the past. And then we do have an open share repurchase authorization and we utilize that in a staged fashion and we'd always like to keep that available. So, that's sort of our priority, no real change in that. As we said in the beginning of the year, we thought this year would be a modest year from an acquisition standpoint. We have a nice pipeline. They tend to be in the short term, likely to be smaller kinds of opportunities than some of the things we've looked at in the past. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Liam D. Burke: Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Liam. Liam D. Burke: Mike, you talked about the tiering strategy in ATS going pretty well. With the emerging markets development sort of being choppy here, how has tiering strategy been progressing on the Adhesive side? Michael F. Hilton: That's the most advanced of our businesses from a tiering approach, and it's going very well. If you look across the major parts of our business, particularly the nonwovens and the packaging, we've got multiple tiers, anywhere from three to six sort of product offerings at various stages, that's gone very well. This year has been a solid year for the high end, but it's also been a good year for the mid tier. And we've spent some money this year building out our engineering and support capability further in China to advance the mid-tier products, and that's meeting with good success there. And some of those products will support tiering outside of the Asia market as well. So I'd say, that's progressing well. We've made our first set of offerings now with the DIMA acquisition and moving that to Suzhou in the electronics side. We also have some tiered offerings in our coatings business as well. So I think if I can, good progress there, but we're most advanced in the Adhesive side. Liam D. Burke: Great. And you mentioned the transition of the new plant for ATS in Colorado. Is that complete and how has that gone? Michael F. Hilton: It's gone well. I think we still have a few pieces of equipment to move in, but the transition has gone very well. The facility is complete. We've got capacity there that not only supports the medical business, but supports some of our other EFD business. At the same time, we've also expanded the capability that came with Avalon in Mexico to support growth of that business and some of the things that we do from an assembly standpoint and other parts of the medical business. So that's all going as planned, very well. Gregory A. Thaxton: So, Liam, just to add that, that's where we comment on approving our productivity or efficiency, it's these facilities that allow us to improve our overall operating performance. Liam D. Burke: Great. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Greg. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Global Hunter. Walter Scott Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Walter. Walter Scott Liptak : Hi. Want to ask kind of a follow-on to the last one, and the charge you took this quarter looks like about $1.8 million. And is that sort of restructuring size as you do these actions that we should be expecting? And then kind of along those lines, which segments, which businesses do you see these productivity opportunities? Michael F. Hilton: So in general, we see productivity opportunities across all of our businesses. I think we've talked in the past that there are a number of different things that we can do. One element of that is optimizing our supply and demand and that may impact some of the facilities, and that's what you've seen here in this quarter. And we expect that there may be some of that going for the exact timing and the impact, that will be a little bit clear as we go forward. But there's also lot of work that we're doing around segmentation of our business and streamlining in various other areas that will be helpful as well as we look at improving both effectiveness and efficiency. So there's opportunities across all of the businesses. Certain ones have more opportunity than others. I think as you've noticed, as we've made some acquisitions, there's been some opportunity there to integrate those more fully and we'll see some of that coming going forward. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. And with the relocation to Colorado benefits, you mentioned that you didn't think you'd see a benefit in the fourth quarter. In 2016, what do you think the positive benefits are to margins? Michael F. Hilton: I'm not sure I want to comment specifically on that one, but we would expect \u2013 as we said, our overall goal is by 2017 to improve 200 basis points and some of that will come in 2016 with that action and probably some others. So don't necessarily want to say specifically on that one, but it's an important improvement for those set of product lines. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. Okay. It sounds good. Thank you. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our host. James R. Jaye: Okay. Michael F. Hilton: Jim, I just want to make one sort of final comment. As we look at sort of the performance so far this year, we do think it is very solid given the sort of weaker environment. As we look at the activity and opportunity going forward, it still looks solid not as robust as we would have hoped coming into the year, but still looks solid. And our team is doing a good job of execution as we expect that we'll continue to execute and execute on these improvement opportunities going through the fourth quarter and then into 2016. So we appreciate all of your support and your attention here. Thank you. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Mike and Greg. This is Jim. I'll be around today, happy to take your calls and have a good weekend. Thanks again for attending the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Please go ahead. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Stephanie. Happy Holidays to everybody listening. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson's Director of Investor Relations. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO and Greg Thaxton our Senior Vice President and CFO. We would like to welcome you to our conference call today, Friday, December 11, 2015 on Nordson's FY '15 fourth quarter results and our FY '16 first quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at Nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until December 18, 2015 which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 86534278. During this conference call forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors, as discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks we will have a question-and-answer session. Now I will turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our FY '15 fourth quarter results and a bit about our first quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fourth quarter conference call. Nordson delivered fourth quarter sales that were within our range of guidance. On a year-over-year basis sales were impacted by negative currency translation and a challenging comparison to the 13% organic growth we delivered in the fourth quarter a year ago. During the quarter we did see a very strong organic growth in our Adhesives Dispensing segment as well as solid organic growth in the Industrial Coatings segment. Within Advanced Technology segment organic growth within fluid management product lines was offset by the cyclical effects in select electronics end markets impacting the electronics systems product lines within the segment. On a full-year basis we delivered organic volume growth of more than 3%. This is solid performance given the very weak economic environment that we've been operating in throughout the year. Operating margin and earnings per share in the quarter were impacted by unfavorable currency comparisons to the prior year and one-time charges related to short term purchase accounting for acquired inventory and restructuring charges for previously announced margin improvement initiatives. Excluding one-time charges of negative currency impact, operating margin in the quarter was about 21%, a solid level given flat organic volume and the quarter's product mix. During the quarter we continued to execute on all phases of our capital deployment strategy. This included closing on the WAFO Production and MatriX Technology acquisitions and distributing $210 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our first quarter 2016 forecast reflects our current backlog, current 12-week order rates and typical seasonality within the business. As we begin 2016, we will continue to target organic growth that exceeds global GDP driven by the strength of our end markets and the initiatives we have in place to drive top line. Our current assumption, however, is that global GDP will continue to be challenging and likely not much different than 2015. We remain committed to driving our margin enhancement initiative discussed in our last earnings call and we're focused on delivering the 200 basis point improvement in normalized operating margin by 2017. I will speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments but first I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our first quarter guidance. Greg? Greg Thaxton : Thank you, and good morning to everyone. I'll first provide some comments on our fourth quarter and full-year results before moving on to our outlook for the first quarter of FY '16. Sales in the fourth quarter were $446 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year's fourth quarter. This change in sales included organic volume that was flat, a 2% increase related to the first-year effect of acquisitions and a 7% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume increased 8% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter, inclusive of 7% organic growth and 1% growth from the first-year effect of the WAFO acquisition. The volume growth was offset by a 10% decrease related to negative currency translation. The 7% organic growth is an outstanding rebel in the current macroeconomic environment and reflects the resilience of the consumer non-durable end markets served by this segment. Organic growth was strong in nonwoven, rigid packaging, injection molding and pelletizing product lines and in most geographies. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment decreased 7% from the prior-year fourth quarter, inclusive of an 11% decrease in organic volume offset by a 4% increase related to the first-year effect of the Liquidyn and MatriX acquisitions. Sales were also negatively impacted by approximately 3% related to unfavorable currency translation. I'll remind you that current results in this segment are challenged in comparison to the prior-year fourth quarter where we delivered organic growth of 21%. In the current quarter organic growth in fluid management product lines was solid, led by strong demand from medical end markets. This growth was offset by softness in automated dispensing and test and inspection product lines serving select electronics end markets. As we have seen over time, these electronic end markets provide excellent organic growth opportunities for Nordson, though they do tend to be more cyclical in nature. Geographically, positive organic growth in the U.S. and Europe in this segment was offset by slower demand in other regions. Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coatings segment increased 2% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, offset by a 6% decrease related to unfavorable currency translation. This is solid organic growth given the macroeconomic backdrop and comes in comparison to a very robust fourth quarter a year ago where we generated organic growth of 16%. The current quarter's growth was driven by demand for our powder, liquid and cold material dispensing product lines in durable goods end markets. Solid demand in the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe in this segment was offset by softness in other regions. Gross margin for the total Company in the fourth quarter was 53% inclusive of a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point as compared to the prior year. As part of our margin enhancement initiative discussed during our third quarter earnings call, we incurred one-time costs during the fourth quarter of approximately $9.1 million, mostly related to severance costs as we further integrate the polymer product lines and look to enhance margin performance across all segments. We also incurred approximately $1.3 million of short term purchase accounting charges in the quarter related to acquired inventory. Operating profit in the quarter including these one-time charges was $76 million and operating margin was 17%. Normalized operating margin to exclude these one-time charges was 19%. Excluding both the one-time charges and the estimated negative currency translation effect as compared to the prior year, operating margin was 21%. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 21% in the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $8 million related to restructuring charges and $100,000 related to short term purchase accounting charges for acquired inventory. Normalized operating margin within this segment to exclude these one-time charges was 24%. Adhesive segment operating margin was 27% in the quarter excluding these one-time items and the estimated effect of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Within the Advanced Technology segment, reported operating margin was 17% in the fourth quarter or 18% on a normalized basis, excluding $1.2 million of short term purchase accounting adjustments for acquired inventory and $700,000 of one-time restructuring charges related to margin enhancement initiatives. Segment operating margin was also impacted by negative volume leverage and product mix within the electronics systems product lines. The estimated effects of currency as compared to the prior year were negligible within this segment given the percentage of sales that are U.S. dollar denominated. The Industrial Coatings segment delivered operating margin of 19% in the fourth quarter or 20% on a normalized basis, excluding approximately $400,000 of one-time charges for restructuring related to our margin enhancement initiative. Industrial Coatings segment operating margin was 22% in the quarter excluding these one-time items and the estimated effects of negative currency translation as compared to the prior year. This is continued outstanding performance for this segment and reflects our ongoing efforts to drive profitability. Net income for the quarter was $50 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.84 or $0.95 excluding one-time items. We have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one-time items. Unfavorable currency translation compared to the prior year impacted fourth quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.15. The fourth quarter's EBITDA was $93 million and cash flow from operations was also $93 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $80 million, reflecting strong cash conversion of 161% of net income as we have trended back to our typical working capital metrics. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. During the quarter we continued our approach of returning capital to shareholders by distributing approximately $14 million in dividends and investing $196 million for the repurchase of 2.9 million shares. As of the end of our fourth quarter we had approximately $151 million available under our current repurchase authorization. During the quarter we also continued to execute on our acquisition strategy with two previously announced purchases. WAFO is a small addition to our polymer processing product line within the Adhesive Dispensing segment and MatriX Technologies is an ideal extension of our test and inspection product line in the Advanced Technology segment. Both of these acquisitions are performing as expected and we welcome the WAFO and MatriX teams to the Nordson family. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain liquid with net debt to EBITDA at 2.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the fourth quarter. Net debt levels reflect acquisitions and opportunistic investments for repurchasing shares. I'll now provide a few comments on our full-year results. Sales for FY '15 were $1.69 billion. As Mike previously mentioned organic growth for the year was more than 3% compared to the prior year. This is solid growth given the low growth macroeconomic environment throughout 2015 and against a very challenging comparison where organic growth in 2014 was in excess of 6%. Unfavorable currency translation as compared to the prior year impacted 2015 sales by $115 million or negative 7%. Full-year gross margin as reported was 54%. Excluding the effects of negative currency translation, gross margin for the year was approximately 55%. Full-year operating profit in FY '15 was $318 million and reported operating margin was 19%. Excluding one-time items and the approximate effects of unfavorable currency translation compared to the prior year, total Company operating margin was 21% for the year. Net income for the full year was $211 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.45 inclusive of a $0.12 per share charge related to one-time items. Unfavorable currency translation impacted full-year earnings per share by approximately $0.54 or 14%. Full-year EBITDA was $384 million and free cash before dividends was $200 million or 95% of net income, again reflective of strong cash conversion. Excluding the investment in our new fluid management facility in Colorado, adjusted cash conversion was 104%. Dividends paid in FY '15 were $55 million and shares repurchased under the repurchase program totaled approximately 5.4 million or 8.6% of shares outstanding at the end of FY '14, totaling $382 million. I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the first quarter of FY '16. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency-neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending December 6, 2015 order rates are down 5% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. We're facing challenging comparisons where total Company order rates were up 10% at this time last year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders were up 7% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Orders were up in most product lines and were led by nonwovens, melt delivery, extrusion dies, general product assembly and rigid packaging. Orders increased in all geographies except Japan. In the Advanced Technology segment order rates for the latest 12 weeks are down 16% against the prior year. Strength in medical fluid management components was offset by cyclical softness in select electronics end markets. Strength in Europe and Japan was offset by other regions. Within the Industrial Coatings segment the latest 12 week order rates are down 14%. Growth in liquid and container product lines was offset by softness in other product lines. Strength in Asia Pacific, Japan and the Americas was offset by softness in the U.S. and Europe. Backlog at October 31, 2015 was approximately $229 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year and inclusive of 5% organic growth and 3% growth due to acquisitions. Backlog amounts are calculated at October 31, 2015 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the first quarter of FY '16. We're forecasting sales to be in the range of down 1% to down 5% as compared to the first quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic volumes down 3% to up 1%, 3% growth from the first-year effective acquisitions and currency headwind of 5% based on current exchange rates. And the midpoint of our sales forecast we expect first quarter gross margin to be about 54% and operating margin to be approximately 13%. This outlook includes short term purchase accounting charges of $1.6 million and estimated restructuring charges of $1.3 million. Excluding these one-time charges, normalized operating margin is estimated to be 14%. Unfavorable currency rates as compared to the prior year are estimated to impact gross margin and operating margin by about 1 percentage point. We're estimating first quarter interest expense of about $5 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30.5%, resulting in first quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.47 to $0.57 per share inclusive of a $0.03 per share charge related to non-recurring items. In addition to this first quarter outlook, the following FY '16 full-year data points may be helpful for modeling purposes. For our effective tax rate we're forecasting the full-year rate to be about 30.5% based on current tax law. For capital spending in 2016, we're forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million. In addition, we do expect to incur additional one-time costs associated with our margin enhancement initiative, primarily associated with integration activities within the adhesive segment. Although difficult to estimate at this time we do not expect the one-time costs in FY '16 to exceed those incurred in FY '15. In summary, we delivered fourth quarter revenue within our range of guidance, resulting in full-year organic growth of more than 3%. Organic growth was solid in the majority of the business with the exception of softness in more cyclical electronics end markets, supported by portions of the Advanced Technology segment. We continued to execute on our balanced capital deployment strategy during the quarter and also continued taking actions which will lead to normalized margin improvement over the next two years. With that, I will turn the call back over to you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First I want to thank our global team for their hard work in 2015. Our employees delivered a solid year in a challenging environment. Negative currency translation was a significant headwind through 2015 and masked what otherwise would have been a record year on several measures. I'm pleased with the more than 3% organic growth we delivered for the year which reflects the technology, application expertise and support we bring to our customers in the diverse end markets we serve. I'm also pleased with the progress we're making on the initiatives that we expect will improve normalized operating margins over the next two years. As we previously reported, we began these actions in our third quarter in our fluid management product lines within Advanced Technology segment. In the fourth quarter the Adhesive Dispensing segment began consolidation of four facilities supporting our extrusion die product line into a single center of excellence and we continued rationalization of product lines based on profitability. Additional actions related to workforce optimization and efficiency initiatives are also underway in all three segments. We expect these actions to improve normalized operating margins with some of the benefits to be realized during 2016. We're providing additional detail on these activities in the coming quarters as they unfold. Our first quarter 2016 forecast reflects our backlog, current 12-week order rates, typical seasonality and challenging comparisons to the same period a year ago. As we begin 2016, the global economy remains weak. However, we continue to target organic growth in 2016 that exceeds global GDP, given our ongoing initiatives around new products, new applications, penetration of emerging markets and recapitalization of our installed base. The diverse set of end markets we serve are all expected to grow over the long term and we're well-positioned to meet customer needs with direct sales and service everywhere in the world. Although we cannot actively predict movement in the exchange rates, if exchange rates remain where they are today, the impact of currency effects on both sales and earnings would be minor in future quarters. The fundamentals of our business are intact, our global team is committed to providing a best-in-class experience to our customers and delivering solid long term returns to our shareholders. We also remain focused on driving continuous improvement throughout the organization through the tools and practices in our Nordson business system. At this time let me turn over the call to you for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from [Patrick Wu] [ph] with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : In regards to the Advanced Tech portion of the business, what is driving the decline in margin? Is it a simple function of low volume or is it mix? Also, in terms of the acquisitions recently, aside from accounting items are these acquisitions additive to segment margins or are they subtractive, if you will? Mike Hilton : You were breaking up just a hair there but let me try and answer the first question. If you look at margins for the year in the Advanced Tech area, your comparison, they're off about 5 percentage points. About 1 point of that relates to currency, a couple points relate to really just lower organic volume relative to last year and an increase in the spending and then about a couple points relate to mix where we had actually a significant decline in our automated dispense area that was offset by our surface treatment products, both of which have good margins but the surface treatment product margins have more bought-in items, less high value-added mix as part of it and so they have a considerably different margin. If you think about it, currency, the margin mix and then some lower organic growth in the segment relative to typical spending increases that we would see, nothing fundamental there in terms of pricing or anything else. As it relates to the acquisitions, the acquisitions that we added were tuck-in acquisitions, one on the polymer side. And then in the Advanced Tech it was really a automated x-ray product that has similar margins to the margins we see in the test and inspection business. So, it really comes down to currency and mix, largely and then some lower volume. Nothing fundamental. Unidentified Analyst : And obviously the lead times for the segment are generally pretty short. When you guys are talking to customers in Advanced Tech, most specifically, what are you guys hearing in terms of CapEx looking out into 2016 and beyond? Has it been down materially or has it just really been down marginally? And how does that compare to your expectations going into next year? Mike Hilton : Let me make a couple of comments. First, if you look at the fluid management part of our business, we continue to see strength in the medical business going forward. We see solid gains of strength in what I call general industry applications in our EFD type products. I would say year on year we saw some softness, particularly in the wearables space, come the end of the year. We think that's more timing than anything else. In the automated systems business, this past year for the wireless business, was not one in terms of a significant degree of change in terms of the product offerings and there are some changes in end customer market share, particularly in China. The one bright spot was really in the auto electronics segment. But when we talk to customers right now -- and this is the time of the year where we're doing a lot of project development work with key customers -- there are a lot of different new product and application activities that we're working on and we're hopeful that they are going to translate into significant growth this year. Obviously that will play out in the second and third quarters as these prospects and development projects turn into orders. But we're hopeful in that regard that we will see an uptick, particularly on the dispense side this year. We're getting some traction now, as well, with the Chinese manufactures that are on the low-end tiered product scale of the automated dispense systems. Unidentified Analyst : One more quick one before I hop back in the queue. What was the mix from parts and consumable in Adhesive Dispensing for the quarter? Mike Hilton : Can you repeat your question? Your connection is not so good so I didn't hear that at all. Unidentified Analyst : What was the mix from parts and consumables in Adhesive Dispensing for the quarter? Greg Thaxton : Total Company was about 42% which trends out to be a pretty consistent percentage for all of the quarters and full year. It's very near that range. And if you look at the various segments, they all trend very near that total Company. I'd say in the quarter we probably had slightly higher than normal within Advanced Tech given this volume shortfall in system dispensing. But adhesives as well as the other segments tend to fall very near that Total Company of 42%. Operator : Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Just touching on that first question a little differently, I'm trying to be an optimist here, do you get a sense that people are just -- 2015 was a bad year, let's punt these capital decisions into 2016 where maybe you're getting a sense just from talking to your customers that we could see a little acceleration here as people have delayed those decisions into 2016? Any thoughts? Mike Hilton : Allison, are you talking about across the portfolio or specific to the electronics part of the discussion? Allison Poliniak : If you want to touch on electronics, but I guess just across the portfolio. I understand that 2015 in this quarter across the industrials was fairly difficult just given some of these capital decisions getting delayed. Just trying to get a sense if maybe they are getting delayed but you're still talking and maybe we feel --? Mike Hilton : So, maybe just talk a little bit across the businesses on prospects and what we're hearing from customers. If you look at the Adhesives segment, in our traditional Adhesives segment, largely driven by the consumer non-durable space, activity has been strong even through Q4 and as we look at it from an order perspective now, it's very solid. In the polymer product lines we're seeing improvements from an order perspective, starting to see some orders come in on the dye business. A lot of that, fluid coating, some specialty film dye, but the solid melt stream components. And our pelletizing was strong in the quarter but that tends to be big project related. So, I'd say encouraging activity there. When we look at the Industrial Coatings business it's been on a strong uptick the last three years. We've got some tough comps in this particular quarter but that feels a lot to us like just timing of larger products, particularly on the auto side. If you look at what remains strong, the auto platform work remains strong and we have some significant project activity there that we expect to come in in the future. The general powder coating environment has been pretty solid, so a lot of prospects. Even when you look across places like Europe, we're seeing solid prospect activity there. And then if you go to the Advanced Tech space, as I said, medical activity looks strong. The general fluid management activity talking to customers looked good from a prospect standpoint. We actually are encouraged that this could be a more significant year from a change perspective in the wireless area, including the wearable piece. And we've gotten some good traction with the local Chinese in terms of new products with our tiered product offering that came from the DIMA acquisition we made in China. So, I'd say we're encouraged on the prospect side of this. I think the areas that appear to be soft geographically, Japan is an area that's soft and we're clearly seeing some investment being pushed off there. China is more of a mixed bag but the areas that are strong, like auto, continued to be strong. And then on the electronics side, obviously that's where a large bit of the uptick would come this year. So, I would say the prospect discussions are good. We need to translate these new developments into orders and that will play out over the next couple of quarters. Allison Poliniak : And then just turning to leverage, 2.8 times, can you just maybe talk about your comfort with that level in this environment, what range you'd be comfortable in here from a leverage perspective? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Allison, this is Greg. You support that with the strong cash generation that this business generates. We're certainly not uncomfortable in this range where we're under our current credit facilities, we have about $200 million available. We certainly have much more than that from a capacity under our covenants perspective. So, we're comfortable in this range and think we still have some dry powder for other strategic initiatives. So, it's not a level that we're not comfortable with in this environment. Mike Hilton : I would just make two comments. Assuming we see GDP in that 2%, low 2% range, we would expect to outgrow that, number one. And, number two, we're on track with the initiatives we have in place to improve our margins which we're seeing some charges this year but will position us well to generate even more cash going forward. Allison Poliniak : Okay. And then just one last thing, just touching on that outgrowth relative to GDP, are you including acquisitions in that thought or is that just purely organic basis? Mike Hilton : No, just organic. We should be able to do that. We're not looking at numbers, we're looking at 3% or 4%, if you look at 2% GDP not 7% or 8%. But we should be able to grow that. And, quite frankly, it's largely the focus around our initiatives. We have a number of specific growth initiatives that are focused on new products, new applications, larger penetration in emerging markets, particularly globalizing some of the acquisitions that we've acquired over the last couple of years. So, we see good plans in place that we can execute on to help mitigate a little softer economic environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Matt McConnell : Just to follow up on the prior question, because that 2.8 leverage is a bit higher than you've carried historically. The decision to go there, was that you saw something opportunistic and you wanted to bump up the buybacks? Or any change in philosophy on the leverage that you're comfortable with? And then maybe you could also talk about M&A capacity and what the M&A pipeline looks like right now. Greg Thaxton : Yes, this is Greg. I'll handle the first part of that question. Clearly with some of the data we've provided, we did believe it was an opportunity from a share repurchase perspective and that's what drove that activity. I wouldn't say at a high level it's a change in our perspective going forward. It was, we felt, an opportunistic time. Mike Hilton : And then just a comment with regard to M&A, we did say this year that our M&A activity would likely be focused on drop-ins and plug-ins. And if you look at the three things we did -- the Liquidyn acquisition was a product line plug-in for our EFD business. The WAFO addition was a make-buy decision given its European capability that we've since gone in and been able to significantly expand the furnace capability there which will help us in our plastics area. And then the MatriX Technology was a way to upgrade our capability from an automated platform and integrate it with our advanced x-ray technology. So, all good plug-ins. I tell you we see more of the same in terms of that smaller drop-in activity. The one area where there are some larger potential opportunities are in the medical device space that's been growing strong double digits for us over the last three years with the acquisitions that we did make. Matt McConnell : And if you saw something, one of those somewhat larger deals on the medical device side, you feel you have the capacity to go after acquisitions in that space right now with the current balance sheet? Mike Hilton : Yes, we think we could do it for the right property. Operator : Our next question comes from John Franzreb with Sidoti. Your line is open. John Franzreb : Just a little bit about the margin enhancement program. Could you touch on what you think the normalized operating margin for the Firm is and what the 200 basis points would add to it? Would you expect the operating margin to end that at the end of the program, firstly? And, secondly, in first quarter guidance, how much margin enhancement do you think you've realized from the program? Mike Hilton : Yes, so just a couple of comments. I'd say we're right on track with our plans in terms of the actions we're taking for the margin enhancements. In the third quarter, our margin enhancements were largely the result of exiting an EFD facility in Europe and consolidating our Minnesota manufacturing into Colorado and Mexico. Those were part of the Advanced Tech segments. A lot of the activity here in this quarter was around improving effectiveness and efficiency across segments, as well as I mentioned we're going to consolidate three U.S. facilities in our dye business to one. We're going to exit one in Belgium and we have some follow on activities to consolidate two facilities in Germany and some other thoughts that we're working on. So, that will play out throughout the year. So, we're right on track in terms of the actions that we're taking according to plan to get us to deliver that 200 basis points in 2017. And on a normalized basis we'll see a portion of that this year. It will be masked by the costs associated with getting there that will show up as a one-time recurring costs but we're right on track there. As far as the overall operating margin, we would see some normalized improvement. It may not be a percent this year but on our way towards a percent and right on track for the 2% next year in a volume-neutral basis. If our volume goes up we should see some leverage on top of that. Greg Thaxton : Just on the comment about and do we think we can continue to expand those beyond once we get to that 200. And I'd say yes. We have our continuous improvement wrapped into our Nordson business system that allows us to continue to look to enhance performance. Again, even outside of that volume leverage, I wouldn't say that we stop after these initiatives. We think we can continue to widen those margins. John Franzreb : Okay, great. But what is the baseline corporate operating margin you're using, because there's been a lot of noise in acquisitions and currency? So, what is the baseline number? It's been very high in the past couple of years, so I just want to get a sense of what the starting point is. Mike Hilton : This year's normalized number, as we look at it for the Company, is around 21%. And that's with what's been going on underlying in the Advanced Tech segment. Greg Thaxton : So, it was a 15% number if we excluded the one-time. We're saying from this 15% number on a go-forward basis over the next year and then in 2017 we expect to widen from there. Mike Hilton : On a volume-neutral basis. So, then the additional volume on top of that should provide some additional leverage. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital markets. Your line is open. Kevin Maczka : Just to be clear on the margin, in Q1 you're expecting to be down about 300 basis points year over year, but you still think with the cost actions you have in place normalized, when you exclude the one-time cost associated with achieving those and currency-neutral, you still think there will be 100 or so basis points of margin lift? That's a reasonable expectation for full-year 2016? Mike Hilton : I think if we split it into two phases, if you look at the structural program I'd say we're right on track with what we're looking to do and exclude one-time we'll see improvement. Whether it's a full 100% points there, not clear, but directionally it'll be moving towards that. And then what we're saying from a volume standpoint, if the year plays out as we expect and the GDP is a couple of percent or so and we outgrow that, we should see some additional volume leverage on that. Greg Thaxton : And, Kevin, the point there, too, is, yes, we're off here on the first quarter but we don't get too concerned about one particular quarter. And this happens to be a quarter that for us, as you know, is a softer quarter. It's a softer quarter for many of our customers in their capital cycle. We've got the holidays, et cetera. As you suggest, we're starting off in a bit of a hole here in the first quarter, but as we look at the project list, as we look at activity within the businesses, we're still targeting that on a full-year basis we'll hit our sales growth targets. Kevin Maczka : On tech, if I could shift over to that one, you mentioned a couple times about the cyclical downturn in some of the electronics markets you saw this quarter. And we know those cycles don't always coincide with macro cycles. But if you're looking for maybe a better year this year on the wireless side, with changeovers, with the wearable that you mentioned, any sense, any view you have on how that cycle bottoms? And do we start to see, will we still be talking about a cyclical downturn the next couple quarters, is the question there? Mike Hilton : If you look at a typical electronics seasonal pattern, first quarter is always soft. That's the quarter where, as I mentioned, we're typically working with customers on development projects that they then would enact in the second and third quarter and the typical commitment and ramp up is generally in that second and third quarter. If you look at last year, we had a particularly strong fourth quarter and a particularly strong first quarter and a lot of that had to do with everybody pushing for wearable opportunities to go out and test the new market segment there. We should expect to see this play out in the second and third quarter. If you look at our typical seasonal data for this business, it declines pretty sharply from the end of the third quarter in through, say, the beginning of January and the peak periods tend to be in the second and third quarter, peaking somewhere in the third quarter typically. That's what we would expect based on the conversations we have now. Now, these new developments which are new product and applications related, need to translate into orders. But we'd expect to see the pickup in the second quarter and a peak in the third quarter, would be typical. Kevin Maczka : Okay. And then just finally from me, we're likely looking at another sluggish year overall in terms of the macro picture. You always have this goal to outpace global GDP. And some of the ways you get there -- new products, emerging markets, installed base -- can you point to something there that would be many needle moving, if you will, that can give some comfort that this could be a year where, in fact, we do exceed global GDP even in a soft market? Mike Hilton : I would say a couple things. If you look at the last two years on an organic basis we've exceeded the global GDP. 2014 was a little more robust at about 6%. This year is a little over 3% with a tougher electronics market. I would say in some of our core adhesives area, both on the packaging side and the nonwoven side, in particular, we would see recap as a driver this year. We had good traction last year and that's continuing into this year. So, in other words, looking at upgrades and improvements and recapitalization of some of our installed base there and we see a lot of customer activity on that front. We're working on some new applications in the product assembly area that relates to some furniture applications and flooring applications that are starting to take off with improvement in the construction industry. I'd say in the polymer area, we're seeing good growth in the fluid coating part of the dies business and some uptick in some specialty dies, getting some traction on our melt stream and some good projects on the polymer pelletizing side of things, particularly in Asia. And that's related to our spherical underwater pelletizing capability. When you look at Industrial Coatings, we think this year is going to be another solid year in the auto platform and we've been pretty successful there. We've got continued upgrades to technology on the powder side and some improvement in the general metal contracting area that we see some traction on. And then if we look at the medical space, there's just a whole slew of new products that we've introduced. We're getting good traction on new products from the Avalon acquisition last year, the value plastics components. We've broadened the product line in a number of ways and we're getting good traction on that. And also we're starting to see some globalization of those businesses. In our cold materials space we've got some new applications going into aerospace. These are not home runs. These are all singles. But with new applications going into the aerospace area they are starting to get some traction. And then I would say our tiering approach is helping us to get some traction with the Chinese wireless companies. We're in with all of them and starting to get some reasonable orders in that area. Again, that's one where we're not quite sure what the pace of conversion will be from manual to automated but the tiering approach is really helping meet their needs there. So, so I would say this year has been a good year in terms of introducing new products. Next year is the area we want to commercialize and take advantage of that and we think we're in pretty good position. A lot of our expectation is these initiatives over and above the float of GDP is whatever is going to drive our growth for next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : I wanted to just dig into the first quarter margin guidance, the 14% adjusted, again and just get an understanding of where you think the Advanced Tech margin might be, like what's the assumption in Advanced Tech. And I'm wondering if it could be single digit. As I look back in the model it looks like in 2014 you started out like that, too, where you had a really weak first quarter margin and then it improved throughout the rest of the year. And I wonder if that's the kind of year you're thinking about again in 2016? Mike Hilton : Certainly if you look at where we're at from an order perspective the whole adhesive has been the one that's been most solid right now. We've been a little softer on the coatings, but that's off a strong comparison and a little bit softer on the Advanced Tech. Those margins in the first quarter typically go down anyway and they would on a year-on-year basis be off just given the volume leverage. So, it's that mix that we're looking at. Walter Liptak : Okay. Is your assumption, though, to be single digit in advanced tech? Greg Thaxton : Walt, this is Greg. We typically in our guidance don't go to the segment and we certainly don't take it down. We just don't work it down to the product line level. So, what I'd suggest is similar to what Mike was saying. We look at where the order rates are. Certainly volume is going to have an impact on what those reported margins will be. Mike Hilton : But we don't see it necessarily as an atypical quarter for us just relative to last year a softer quarter in those areas. Walter Liptak : Okay. And if in the second and third quarters some of these new products, the wearables, etcetera, come through, those would impact the automated assembly which tends to be higher margin -- is that correct? Mike Hilton : Most of the wireless activity falls into the automated assembly space. There are some things that we sell for manual and modest tabletop automation, too, that go into some customers. If you recall, we have a range of customers. The ones that are just stepping out of doing things manually might go to simple tabletop automation which would fall into our EFD segment. But most of it typically falls into the automated segment particularly now that we have the first-level tiered automated product to offer, that we would expect to see growth across that range. Greg Thaxton : And both of those dispensing are good for us. Those tend to be our higher-margin products. So, if we see that demand that plays out within the business that's good from a margin perspective. Walter Liptak : And just as a last one, the variance from your guidance, what changed during the quarter that you weren't expecting, if you had higher guidance for EPS heading in? Was it the mix in Advance Tech? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Walt, that is the gap in guidance. When you look at where the revenue shook out it's the mix issue and the impact on margins within Advanced Tech and specifically in the electronic systems portion of the product line. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Radigan with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Joe Radigan : A couple questions on the polymer businesses. On the ejection molding side, some of the equipment OEMs, I think have cautioned that industry growth could slow there next year following a couple pretty robust years. How are you thinking about the growth in that business? Would you expect to be in line with industry trends there or is there another share gain catalyst or something else there? Mike Hilton : I think our expectation is continued growth in that segment. A lot of it will be, I think, driven by the fact that we're improving our capability in that area in Asia and, to some extent, in Europe and the fact that the WAFO acquisition we made will help us from a capability standpoint in Europe for those component products. And it largely will impact mostly our screw and barrel business. And we do have some new applications that we're working on, particularly for twin barrels and some coating applications. And then we're seeing some good growth getting beyond the injection molding piece, both in our melt stream applications with new products and in our fluid coating business on the die side. And we're starting to see for the first time some uptick in general orders in the die business. I think certainly the things that have been driving the injection molding have been things like auto, medical and, to a lesser extent, some of the consumer product conversions going on. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then maybe just to follow up on your comment on the die business, Mike, are you seeing industry capacity there finally normalize to where there could be some expansion? Or is this more specialized type one-off items on the higher-end buy X stuff? Mike Hilton : I would say it's more special items at the moment, although we're starting to see some requests and activities on the buy X side. And we like to see a little bit more traction on that to conclude that we finally turned the corner there. But on some specialty applications we're seeing some uptick. So, I'd say no, not yet. We would like to get a little bit more traction there but maybe some early indications that things are improving. Joe Radigan : Okay. And then maybe lastly, more broadly, in adhesives, is there a risk at all that low oil prices impacts the customer decision to upgrade, meaning, maybe with the rationalization, that lower feedstock costs make the value proposition of more efficient equipment less compelling? Is that a concern at all? Mike Hilton : We're not really seeing that so much. If you think about the drivers for upgrading, certainly that's one of the drivers. But speed is another driver, so getting effective capacity out that reduces unit costs. And then we're seeing feature function changes. For example, in the nonwoven space, our customers are moving towards more clothing-like diapers and adult incontinence products which drive change there and require some recapitalization. So, I would say from an efficiency and therefore cost of the adhesives products, it might be a modestly lower driver, but for some of the other things we're still seeing interest in recapitalization. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Just two quick things, first Greg, do you have an idea of the magnitude of FX headwind that you'd be facing for the full year if rates stay where they're at today? And even if you're able to do it, on a more granular basis by quarter? I know you indicated Q1 is going to be a head wind but how do you think the year progresses from an FX standpoint? Greg Thaxton : Matt, if you look at where the euro, yen and the pound, the three bigger currencies for us, once we get through the first quarter here, we pretty much lap the currency effect where, for each of those quarters two, three and four, where rates are today are pretty much right in line with where they were prior year in those quarters. So, we'll have this currency impact this quarter. If rates stay where they are it will be minimal in the future quarters. Mike Hilton : Got it. And then maybe just one for Mike, can you talk about the magnitude of order weakness you saw in the U.S., what the drivers were there? Did it surprise you? I think the number was down 12, I don't have it in front of me. But just what's driving the softness you're seeing in the U.S.? And should that be a broader concern? If you look at the U.S., a big driver of the short term has been in our Industrial Coatings business. And that's really linked to year-over-year timing of bigger projects, particularly auto platform projects. As we look at it and the prospects out there, there are still a lot of prospects for new auto platforms we're working on now and we think it's more of a timing issue. And, similarly, from a powder coating business perspective, there is some larger projects in the first quarter last year that we see perhaps playing out later in the year this year. And I think that's the most significant piece that we see there, but when we talk to the customers, look at the prospect list and bidding activity, I'd say at the moment we're encouraged by what we see there in those areas. Greg Thaxton : And, Matt, just to add to that, particularly with those two product lines, they tend to be larger dollars, so timing can really have an impact. Whatever your cutoff point is for your comparison, the timing of those orders can have a big swing, create a big swing. Operator : Our final question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Chris Glynn : I did get bumped off accidentally at the beginning of the Q&A so sorry if I repeat some covered ground. Just looking at the ATS margin progression through the year as opposed to year over year, I think the mix in FX, they were tough throughout. So, if we look at a lower adjusted margin in the first quarter compared to the first quarter and the second quarter margins down despite seasonally higher volumes and again assuming mix and FX were a little challenging throughout, what's that tail off here at fiscal year end? Greg Thaxton : Within the Advanced Tech segment the tail off is largely mix. Mike Hilton : So, to be clear, our dispense business was down pretty significantly year over year and our surface treatment business was up. That's the mix effect we're talking about. Greg Thaxton : We were commenting earlier that where we have application demand that drives the need for automated dispensing, we generate higher margins there than we do in other portions of that product line. Now, the positive side is we offset that dispensing revenue with some new application revenue within that Advanced Tech space. It just comes at lower gross margins than our dispense platform does. Chris Glynn : Okay. So, the mix issue is actually much more acute in the fourth quarter than it was in some of the prior quarters of FY '15 that also had some mix challenges? Greg Thaxton : Right. And it's really a function of when the products were delivered. Chris Glynn : Okay. These things created a step function down. Does that set the table for a step function up rather than a normal incremental margin analysis if mix normalizes or should we think more of this as a reset in the ATS margins? Mike Hilton : No, I wouldn't say it's a reset. If you look at the year-on-year comparison we talked about earlier, currency was about a 1% impact. The mix was a couple percent or so impact. Then volume relative to spend was very modest in total, so we lost some incremental volume leverage there. In all of our businesses, we've talked about actions we're taking to improve effectiveness and efficiency, including that segment. So, we think as we get back to a more normal mix and without further currency impacts we should bump back up in that business. So, no, there's not a permanent change, there's not a pricing change, there's not a competitive change, but there is pretty substantial mix. And as Greg was saying, if you look at the composition of what we sell in, say, dispense versus surface treatment, we buy much less in that product line, so we're selling essentially only all of the high value-added product and that's why we've got a difference. Chris Glynn : Right, that makes sense. A little bit of a similar framework for ADS -- the margin on adjusted basis, 24% in the quarter, a step back from prior couple quarters despite seasonally higher volumes and better organic growth. Is this another instance where we just say mix is this one quarter and something else in another quarter? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Chris, as you mentioned, normalized would have been 24%. And currency also was a big impact here, that if you excluded currency we would have been 27%. So, it would have actually been slightly accretive to where we were prior year. Mike Hilton : The biggest segment was the currency impact. Chris Glynn : Right, but it wasn't any worse than the prior couple quarters, was it? Greg Thaxton : Slightly larger in the fourth quarter given the volume. Chris Glynn : Okay, that's all I have. Thanks a lot. Operator : That does conclude the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Thank you, everybody, for attending the call. I am around today. I do have some calls scheduled. I'm also around next week for follow-ups, anybody listening. Thank you again and appreciate your interest and attention in Nordson. Thank you. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect and everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Shaneez. This is Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Communications. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, February 23, 2016, to report our Nordson's FY 2016 first quarter results and our FY 2016 second quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until March 01, 2016, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You'll need to reference ID number 44144362. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session. Now, I will turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our FY 2016 first quarter results and a bit about our second quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's first quarter conference call. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we're pleased to report very strong organic growth compared to the prior year across all product lines in our largest segments; Adhesive Dispensing. We also delivered positive organic growth in our Industrial Coating segment. We did see softness in the Advanced Technology segment during the quarter against a very challenging prior-year comparison. As a reminder, Advanced Technology organic volume increased 29% in the first quarter of FY 2015 compared to 2014. However, we are encouraged by recent order rates, which are up high-single digits in this segment for most of 12 weeks compared to the prior year. Including the first year effect of acquisitions, total company sales volume was up 4% in the quarter compared to prior year. Unfavorable currency translation continued to be a headwind in the quarter, offsetting the volume growth by about 5% compared to prior year. Operating margin in the quarter was 14% or 17% on a normalized basis, excluding the approximate effects of unfavorable currency translation compared to prior year. Reported diluted earnings per share in the quarter exceeded the level of the prior year's first quarter as one-time discrete tax benefits more than offset the negative impact of one-time charges. Unfavorable currency translation as compared to the prior year reduced reporting earnings per share by approximately $0.14. We also continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter, distributing $46 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our second quarter 2016 forecast reflects our current backlog, which is up 10% compared to the end of the first quarter last year and our current 12-week order rate, which are up 1% over the same 12 weeks a year ago on a currency-neutral basis. The current run rate is likely stronger than the 1% as this period is impacted by the timing of Chinese New Year. We expect to deliver solid revenue growth in the second quarter over the prior year, including positive organic growth and a lower currency translation headwind based on the current exchange rate environment. At the same time, we remained cautious given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. We're continuing to focus on the initiatives we've previously discussed that will improve normalized operating margin. I'll speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide more detailed commentary on the current results and our second quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you and good morning to everyone. Regarding first quarter results, sales were $372 million, a decrease of less than 2% from the prior year's first quarter. This change in sales included a 4% increase in volume from the prior year's quarter comprised of a slight improvement in organic volume and more than 3% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions. Volume improvement was offset by a 5% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year's first quarter. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume increased 12% as compared to the prior-year first quarter, inclusive of 11% organic growth and 1% growth from the first year effect of the WAFO acquisition. Unfavorable currency translation as compared to the prior year reduced sales by 7%. The 11% organic growth is an outstanding level in the current macroeconomic environment and reflects the resilience of the consumer non-durable end markets served by this segment. Organic growth was strong in every product line. On a geographic basis, we generated strong volume growth in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the United States. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment decreased 8% from the prior year first quarter, inclusive of a 15% decrease in organic volume, offset by a 7% increase related to the first year effect of the Liquidyn and MatriX acquisitions. Sales were also negatively impacted by approximately 3% related to the unfavorable currency translation as compared to the prior year's first quarter. As Mike noted, current quarter results in this segment are challenging in comparison to the prior year first quarter, where we delivered organic growth of 29%. The result for last year's first quarter do not follow the typical seasonality of this segment where volume builds as the year progresses. Organic volume growth during the current quarter in our surface treatment and medical fluid management product lines was offset by declines in other product lines, largely related to electronics end markets. These markets have historically driven solid organic growth for Nordson and recent order rates and project activity in the space are encouraging. We're also pleased by the performance of the Liquidyn and MatriX acquisitions in this segment, both of which are meeting our expectations. Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 2% compared to the first quarter a year ago, offset by a 5% decrease related to unfavorable currency translation. Organic growth in the quarter was driven by demand for our liquid painting, container coating and UV curing product lines. Regional demand was strong in Asia Pacific, the Americas and Japan. Gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was 53%, inclusive of a negative currency impact of more than 1 percentage point as compared to the prior year. As part of the margin enhancement initiative we have previously described, we incurred one-time charges during the first quarter of approximately $1 million, mostly related to the Adhesive Dispensing and Advanced Technology segments. We also incurred approximately $1.5 million of short-term purchase accounting charges in the quarter, within the Advanced Technology segment related to the step up in value of acquired inventory. Operating profit in the quarter, including these one-time charges, was $52 million and operating margin was 14%. As Mike previously noted, operating margin excluding one-time charges and the negative impact of currency translation as compared to the prior year was 17%. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 25% in the first quarter, inclusive of approximately $600,000 in charges related to restructuring and short-term purchase accounting charges for acquired inventory. Adhesive segment operating margin was 27% in the quarter, excluding these one-time charges and the estimated effect of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Within the Advanced Technology segment, reported operating margin was 7% in the first quarter, inclusive of approximately $500,000 related to restructuring charges and $1.5 million related to short-term purchase accounting charges for acquired inventory. Normalized operating margin within this segment to exclude these one-time charges was 8%. Operating margin in the current quarter reflects product mix and negative leverage on lower volume, mainly related to electronics end markets. Advanced Technology segment operating margin was 9% in the first quarter, excluding these one-time charges and the estimated effect of currency translation as compared to the prior year. We do expect to leverage sales volume growth to generate significant improvement in operating margin in this segment as the year progresses, which is typical performance for this segment. The Industrial Coating segment delivered operating margin of 8% in the first quarter. This level of operating margin reflects seasonally lower first quarter volume, typical of this segment. Excluding the approximate effects of negative currency translation compared to the prior year, segment operating margin was 10% in the quarter. For the company, net income for the quarter was $41 million, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.72, 4% higher than last year's first quarter. Excluding one-time items, normalized diluted earnings per share were $0.61. We've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share. Additionally, unfavorable currency translation, as compared to the prior year, reduced first quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.14. The first quarter's EBITDA was $70 million and cash flow from operations was $49 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $38 million, reflecting cash conversion of 91% of net income. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. During the quarter, we continued our approach of returning capital to shareholders by distributing approximately $14 million in dividends and investing $32 million for the repurchase of shares. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain liquid with net debt-to-EBITDA at 2.87 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter. We do have additional capacity available as we're currently borrowing well below our most-restrictive debt covenants and our strong free cash flow provides additional capacity. I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. As we typically do, we provided our most-recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency-neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending February 14, 2016, order rates are up 1% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. As we've noted in the past, order growth rates can fluctuate from week to week. And for most of the last several weeks, 12-week order rates on a currency-neutral basis have been positive compared to the prior year such that our backlog, excluding acquisitions, is up 8% over the prior year. And as Mike noted, there is likely some negative impact due to the timing of Chinese New Year in the most recent order rates. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are down 1% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Positive order rates in packaging and nonwoven product lines are offset by softness in other product lines. Geographically, orders were strong in Japan, Europe and the Americas. Again, timing does have an effect on order rates. And for most of this fiscal year, 12-week order rates in the Adhesive segment have been up mid- to high-single digits over the same periods a year ago. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 8% as compared to prior year. These order rates reflect a strong return in demand for automated dispensing systems related to electronic end markets with continued strength in our medical fluid management product lines. Order rates were strong in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas, while the U.S. and Japan were essentially flat. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are down 5%. Growth in cold material dispensing systems for automotive applications and UV curing products was offset by softness in other product lines. Positive order growth in Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Europe was offset by softness in other regions. Comparisons in this segment are challenging, where order rates were up 39% a year ago at this time; however project activity remains robust. Backlog at January 31, 2016 was approximately $247 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year and inclusive of 8% organic growth and 2% growth due to acquisitions. Backlog amounts are calculated at January 31, 2016 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 2% to 6% as compared to the second quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of an increase in organic volume of 1% to 5%, 2% growth from the first year effect of acquisitions and a negative currency impact of 1% based on current exchange rates. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect second quarter gross margin to be approximately 55% and operating margin to be approximately 19%. This outlook includes one-time charges of approximately $1.3 million. Excluding these one-time charges, normalized operating margin is estimated to be 20%. Unfavorable currency rates as compared to the prior year are estimated to impact gross margin and operating margin by about 1 percentage point. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $6 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30%, resulting in second quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.85 to $0.95, inclusive of a $0.02 per share charge related to non-recurring charges. In addition to the second quarter outlook, the following updates on FY 2016 full year basis may be helpful for modeling purposes. For effective rate, we're forecasting the full-year rate to be about 30% based on current tax law and excluding discrete items. For capital spending in 2016, we're forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million. In addition, we do expect to occur additional non-recurring charges associated with our margin enhancement initiatives, primarily associated with integration activities within the Adhesive segment. As we indicated last quarter, the size and timing of these non-recurring charges in FY 2016 is difficult to estimate precisely, but we expect these charges to be well below the amount incurred in fiscal 2015. In summary, Nordson delivered slightly positive organic growth in the current quarter in a challenging macroeconomic environment and against the robust period of organic growth a year ago. Reported earnings per share exceeded the level of the prior year's first quarter and normalized earnings per share exceeded the high end of our normalized guidance. Looking ahead, our current quarter backlog and recent order rates have been solid, leading us to forecast solid revenue growth over the prior year second quarter, including 3% organic growth at the midpoint of guidance. And we expect to leverage the sales increase to drive improvement in earnings per share as compared to the same period a year ago, despite a tough macroeconomic environment and currency headwinds. With that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First, I want to thank our global team for their ongoing efforts. They continue to serve our customers at an extremely high level and are committed to continuous improvement. As Greg mentioned, given our backlog and order rates, we expect organic volume growth to be approximately 3% compared to the prior year, at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance. This is a strong level given the continued softness in the global macroeconomic environment and reflects the solutions we bring to the diverse end markets we serve. We're particularly pleased with the ongoing strength we're seeing in the Adhesive Dispensing segment and the return of demand we're starting to see within Advanced Technology electronics and markets. We expect to leverage this increased volume to deliver normalized operating margins and earnings per share and exceed the level of the same period a year ago. I'm also pleased to report that we're making solid progress on our margin enhancement initiatives. During the quarter, we continue to execute on integration and footprint optimization activities within the Adhesive Dispensing segment. We also took action within the Advanced Technology segment to drive efficiency within our electronic systems product lines. We plan to continue executing on activities across the company that will enable us to meet our goal of 200 basis points improvement to the normalized operating margin by the end of 2017. Overall, the trajectory of the global economy remains uncertain for the year. At the same time, we remain well-positioned to capture growth opportunities when and where they occur. We remain focused on continuous improvement and our strong ongoing cash generation provided the ability to fund multiple priorities that will benefit our shareholders over the long term. At this point, let me turn over the call to you for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Liam D. Burke: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Liam. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Liam D. Burke: Mike, the margin improvement in Adhesive systems, could you give us a little color on the product mix there just directionally how the polymer business performed? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So, this is a solid quarter for the polymer business. I'd say if you look at the margin improvement overall, I would say, something like a third that is probably related to the initiatives that we've talked about taking, and then the other two-thirds is split between the volume growth that we've seen and normalized continuous improvement kind of activities. And so, it was really solid quarter for both the sort of traditional core adhesives as well as the polymer business from a sales perspective. Liam D. Burke: Okay. And on the electronics side, you're seeing the bounce there. How about on the mobile side, is there any life on that side? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. What I would say is, in this quarter, we haven't seen that sort of tick up. What have seen is some activity in the semiconductor side on sort of Advanced Technology, particularly affecting our dispense businesses. And we have started to see a step up in our tiered products in Asia where we have some penetration into the mobile customer base, primarily the Chinese mobile customer base, that's more than onesies and twosies. I would say the normal sort of seasonal pickup that we see in this business we'd expect to see more in Q2 and going into Q3. That said, there are a lot projects that we're working on right now, which is typical at this time, where we go through a qualifying effort and then the order placement tends to occur later in Q2 into Q3. So, I would say that activity level is high and particularly encouraging across the Dispense segment. Liam D. Burke: Great. Thank you, Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Charley Brady : Hi. Morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Charley. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Charley Brady : Can you just talk on the Adhesive Dispensing? You just commented on some of the margin there, but I wonder can you just give us what the aftermarket percentage was on that? And was there any sort of \u2013 was there any mix impact? I mean that's a pretty strong margin performance out of that segment this quarter despite the higher volumes. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I would say \u2013 Greg's looking it up, because I don't remember off hand what the mix is on the parts and systems. I don't think that's a big issue in the quarter. And I would say really every product line was up nicely, whether it was the packaging, the nonwovens, the product assembly, the four product lines within the polymer area were all up nicely in the quarter. So, that was certainly very, very encouraging there. So, I don't think there's a significant mix effect. Greg on... Gregory A. Thaxton: No. There is not. In fact, within the Adhesive segment, the percentage of parts sales is actually just slightly lower than what it was in the first quarter last year. So, it's not driven by a mix shift between systems and parts. Charley Brady : Okay. And then just Mike on your commentary on the 12-week order rates in Adhesive Dispensing, down 1% for the whole 12 weeks, but you're saying, for the majority of that 12 weeks, is up mid- to high-single digits, is that correct? Can you just put some more color around that? Was it just you started off the year down significantly and just kind of snapped back or what's driving that? Michael F. Hilton: No. I'd say there's a couple of things. I'd say, if you look at this year versus last year, we do have the Lunar New Year hitting in this order week period. So, for that week, we essentially registered no orders. And so, you have a bit of a swing associated with that. It doesn't mean there aren't orders. We just didn't have any recorded. I'd say, secondly, our core adhesives continued to remain up sort of mid-single digits. The polymer business was off a little bit, but there's really more lumpiness on products. If you look at that business over the last couple of quarters, it was up 9%, it was up 20%-plus in this quarter. It's just timing more than anything else there. So, there is a Chinese New Year effect, not sure how big that is. And then there's some project timing effect and solid sort of core adhesive performance. Charley Brady : All right. One more and I'll hop back in queue. Just on M&A pipeline, can you just kind of give us a sense of how that's looking these days and sort of multiples on that as well? Thanks. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. I would say, this year is looking a bit like last year, where we have a nice pipeline, but likely to be smaller tuck-in kinds of opportunities. The medical area is one, where there could be some larger opportunities. But at this point in time, it looks like smaller kind of tuck-ins is what we're talking about for this year as well. We can probably go to the next question then. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Christopher D. Glynn: Okay. Thanks. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Chris. Good morning. Christopher D. Glynn: Hey. So, we've had a multiple kind of quarter period of some negative mix, I would call it, at ATS and you've started to \u2013 I think you've mentioned hints in the past, maybe a little more directly talking about stronger trends building for the dispense systems at ATS, which do help mix. So, just wanted to revisit the question on if there has been some primary fundamental resets on sustainable mix at ATS? And then, clarify the comment on expectations for margin improvement for the segment? Does that, in fact, refer to the full year or relative to the start to the current year? Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Yeah. So, just a couple of comments. Last year, we had a more modest year from a dispense standpoint in the electronics systems side of that business and we had a really strong year as related to surface treatment or technology business. And that had a significant effect on mix, both good businesses and product lines, but a significant effect on mix. The surface treatment business is continuing to remain solid. The dispense business is starting to pick up. In this quarter, we've seen some of the advanced packaging on the semi side translate into nice orders with some of the new dispense technology that we have out there that works well at the wafer level. We also saw our Tier \u2013 sort of Tier II products coming out of China, going into some of the Chinese suppliers, that are largely on the mobile side, pick up. And then, I'd say, from a project standpoint, this is the time of the year where we see a lot of project activity from a qualifying standpoint and we do see a lot of dispense projects across the full spectrum, some that fall into our EFD business and a lot that fall into our electronics systems business. We haven't really seen the impact of the orders yet there is what I was trying to suggest. I think the earlier comment was suggesting that, as the year builds, as the volume grows, we'll see significant margin improvement. And if you look back historically, last year maybe a little bit of anomaly. But if you look back to last three years or four years, we've typically seen a more modest first quarter and then margins in the 20% for the full year. And assuming these projects that we're working on translates into revenue, we would expect the same kind of improvement in overall annual performance. Christopher D. Glynn: Okay. So, the margin improvement comment characterizes both normal seasonality, just for the record, but also it is a comment on expectations for full year versus the prior year? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Again, the caveat is those projects translate into the revenue and last year some of them didn't go ahead. But I'd say, we've got a broad range of products this year and we're encouraged by what we see at this point. Christopher D. Glynn: Okay. And then the 8% core backlog build that's a pretty sweet number. You often make comments just cautioning that 12 week \u2013 any 12-week period can have short-term influences. And in this case, the short-term influence might suggest the 8% was understate. But at any rate, could you kind of make that leap and tie that 8% to what \u2013 in your wisdom, what your sense of the kind of real trend of your business efforts are out there in the marketplace? Michael F. Hilton: Well, certainly, the 8% is a good start. The most-recent order rates are down to closer to the sort of 1% level, although we provided the caveat around the Lunar New Year having some impact there. What I would say is, and Greg alluded to this, everything that's going into the consumer non-durable space looks pretty good at this point in time and pretty resilient in the face of a macro environment that's clearly uncertain and trending to the level that we suggested last quarter in the kind of low 2% for the year. I would say, in the larger project range, the things that would affect say product assembly, some of our coatings business, we see good activity. But that's the area, where if anything got pushed, it might be in that area as people question capital spending going forward. And we're seeing some of that activity like that in China leading to some softer numbers in the short term. But I would say, when we look then to project list and funded project list, that also looks encouraging across most businesses. So, in the quarter, we've said, hey, the midpoint looks like 3% even with the backlog at 8% based on the most-recent order rates. And again, I think we're encouraged on the non-durable space, we're cautious of it \u2013 on the durable space just because it's just not that clear at the moment. But activity level is not falling off. Christopher D. Glynn: Great. Makes sense. I'll let it go. Thanks. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Allison. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Just talking a little bit on the cadence of orders, I know obviously Chinese New Year sort of impacted the back half of that. But was there any notable change in your businesses relative \u2013 when we sort of hit that January 1 switch, that capital was freeing up a little bit from your customers? Michael F. Hilton: I would say, no significant change, typically for those customers that are on an annual capital budget, most things get approved by the end of January and we start to see them let and come through in the February and beyond timeframe. So, through the quarter, I'd say it played out fairly typically as what we expect. So, nothing unusual there. We'd expect the bigger projects to be let in the third quarter \u2013 in the second quarter and then into the third quarter. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Perfect. And then just going back to sort of your comments around acquisition, any \u2013 I know you mentioned medical tuck-ins and maybe you have some larger ones there. Any change to the multiples in this environment? Have you noticed this pull in a little bit, just given the uncertainty? Michael F. Hilton: I would say not yet, we'd like to see that. But I'd say not yet. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Okay. We'll leave with that then. Thank you. Michael F. Hilton: Okay. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Walter Scott Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Walter. Gregory A. Thaxton: Hi, Walter. Walter Scott Liptak : I want to ask about your U.S. orders, down 6%, that wouldn't be impacted, I don't think, by timing or anything except for maybe some concern over the macro and a slowing international. So, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the U.S. orders. Is the stock market or concern about the economy bit negative or anything related to the strong dollar and that impacting your export sales? Michael F. Hilton: No, I would say, most of it would fall in the category of project timing year-over-year. Last year, this period of time, overall U.S. orders were up 12%. And particularly, in our Coatings business we had very, very strong orders in the auto platform business. And so, that's sort of a year-over-year effect that's having some impact. And we think it's more project timing than anything else. So, no, it's not an international or currency-related impact. It's more project timing. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. Kind of in a similar way, just being more specific about the adhesive in North America, it sounds great, the mid-single-digit kind of growth outlook for adhesives, I wonder if you could talk specifically about adhesives in North America and the pipeline of orders and activity or pipeline of business out there? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I would say, in general, packaging and nonwovens, was tend to be the non-durable piece, are pretty solid. I would say, on the product assembly side, it's a little weaker at the moment. Again, they tend to be more higher dollar, more capital related. We expect some of that from a seasonal standpoint and we do see good activity. But if anything would get pushed, it would be things like the product assembly area and then a number of the coatings-related activities and maybe some of the bigger polymer projects. So, that's the one that, while we're not hearing that at the moment, that's probably where the risk would be. And right now, it looks more like a normal quarter on the product assembly timing, but that's the one area that's been a little bit softer within the quarter. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. Great. Okay. Thank you. Michael F. Hilton: All right, Walt. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Kevin Maczka with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Kevin Richard Maczka : Thanks. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Richard Maczka : Mike, we've talked for some time now about these tiered products in the China mobile, I'm wondering if you can given an update there on the traction you're seeing there, the size of business that that is for you now, what kind on growth rate you're seeing, margins, that kind of thing. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So, I would say, it's just starting to move from the handful of unit orders to orders that are more in the range, 20, 30, 40 kind of units at a time, so starting to get some traction. These are mid-tier products, so they would have \u2013 they'd be fully automated, but not necessarily as sophisticated as our high-end products when you think about vision system and dual dispensing and things like that. They're coming out of China largely, at our Suzhou facility, so we have nice margins on this business. Not as good as our fully-featured products, but good margins in the business. I would say, though, in general, the Chinese manufacturers are still pretty low on the curve from an automation perspective. They still do a lot manually. And we think, in the long run, that's a nice upside for us. It's not driving that part of the segment at the moment, but we have gone from putting units in, demonstrating them, selling a handful of units to real orders, and so that's encouraging. Kevin Richard Maczka : And when you talk about units, what's a typical ballpark dollar value for a unit like this? And does it capture still the same type of margin that your higher-end more bells and whistles units do? Michael F. Hilton: I would say the answer to the first one is it's probably 50% to two-thirds of the pricing of the high-end units and the margins wouldn't be quite as high, but they're probably within 10 points of the kind of margins we see in the high-end units. The high-end units have a lot more features. So, they might be dual dispense systems with laser vision systems and so forth. So, they'd be different margins, but good margins nonetheless. Kevin Richard Maczka : Yeah. Makes sense. And then, this snapback, if you will, in the electronics demand, how much of that is coming from company-specific things you're doing like this in the way of introducing new products and getting traction with them versus some of your markets just snapping back? I know you mentioned the semiconductor area, but how much of this is market versus things you're doing? Michael F. Hilton: I would say, it's a mix. The comment on the semi side is really a function of some new technology going into different customers that are on the wafer side of things, so leading-edge customers on the wafer side. So, that's really a combination of new product technology and a new application there, which is encouraging, and like to see that grow. We have introduced a whole new line of dispense technology that's getting some traction. And I'd say we haven't yet seen the big uptick that we would expect seasonally, which as I said earlier would come later in the quarter. So, we are seeing some improvements in the underlying customer base, but it's probably more linked to new products and technologies that we're offering than anything else. Kevin Richard Maczka : Got it. And if I could just ask one more high level on the adhesives order, so when we see those order growth rates in the 6% to 12% all year last year go to negative 1% in Q1, there was a Chinese New Year in there last year at some point too, where you probably had a week without orders. Your message is not that there is some new macro challenge and things have slowed, but more an issue of timing and the outlook there is still as encouraging as it was last quarter. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I'd say it's encouraging. And as I commented on the sort of traditional adhesives businesses, the non-durables are solid. The area where we have a little more concern is on the product assembly, which is more investment related, but that's been solid today, but we have some concerns \u2013 a little bit more concern going forward. But this is a period where that's typically what you'd see. And on the polymer side, we've come out of two really strong quarters from order entry. It's a little bit off right now, but that looks more like project timing than anything else based on the activity levels. So, I'd say, we are encouraged. We're not trying to get too far ahead of ourselves here, though, just given the general level of uncertainty in the macro environment. Kevin Richard Maczka : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matthew McConnell : Thank you. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Hey, Matt. Matthew McConnell : I want to follow-up on the comments earlier. I know polymers is doing pretty well. Can you give us a sense of where the margins are now relative to the segment average and maybe what's been accomplished on the restructuring there and what's left to do maybe over the remainder of the year? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Well, I would say, in general, we're still on the early phases of the improvement activity in the polymer side of things. So, the margins aren't where we'd like to see them. But just to give you a sense of things that we've accomplished so far, we have shutdown and exited our Belgian facility in Europe and consolidated that. We have got out of two small product lines related to that, one plating and one our rolls business in the U.S. that were not making money for us and so we've exited those businesses. We have pulled together the plant to consolidate our German facilities from two to one and that requires expanding the one facility. So, that's going to play into 2017. In the U.S., in our dies business, we have three facilities, we'll go down at least one and that should play out over the next year. And then, there's some other activities that we have underway that we'll talk more about later in the year that continue the improvement plan in that business. But I would say, we are on track with our expectations there and we're doing everything we can to pull in the time horizon. But when you look at consolidating facilities and expand ones, while (42:56) the timing to make that happen stretches out more than everybody would like, but we're going as fast as we can in that regard. So, I'd say, we are on track. The margins aren't where we like to see them yet. We haven't really seen the big volume drivers come back yet, even though we've had some nice volume growth and that's something that we expect to see probably more in the 2017, 2018 timeframe. But we're on a good path. Gregory A. Thaxton: And Matt, this is Greg, I'd add, as part of our overall initiative to drive our margin improvement at 200 basis points, certainly this product line is a part of that improvement. Matthew McConnell : Okay. All right. Great. Thanks. That's helpful update. Appreciate it. Operator : And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Jaye for any further remarks. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Shaneez, and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. I'm available this week for follow-up questions. So, thank you again for your ongoing interest in Nordson. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Jim Jaye : Thank you, Nicole and good morning. I am here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, May 24, 2016 to report on Nordson\u2019s FY \u201816 second quarter results and our third quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until June 7, 2016 which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 5351714. During this conference call, forward-looking statements maybe made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. Now, I will turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our FY \u201816 second quarter results and a bit about our third quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s second quarter conference call. I am very pleased to report that the global Nordson team delivered record second quarter performance, with revenue, operating profit and diluted earnings per share significantly higher than the levels we generated a year ago. This performance came against continued backdrop of modest microeconomic growth. Total company organic sales growth in the quarter was more than 8% compared to the prior year and follows the momentum in order rates and project activity we reported last quarter. This performance exceeded the top end of our guidance by 300 basis points. To be clear, we did have some order activity pull into the second quarter from the third quarter. Growth was especially robust in the Advanced Technology segment as demand in electronics end markets combined with continued strong growth in medical and industrial end markets grow strong double-digit improvement from the prior year. The Adhesive Dispensing segment delivered excellent performance as well with broad-based growth across the portfolio driven largely by consumer nondurable end markets. We did see some softness in the Industrial Coating segment during the quarter against a very challenging prior year comparison, where sales volume was up 23% at this time a year ago. Revenue did increase sequentially from the first quarter of this year at a more typical pace compared to the accelerated rate of a year ago. We leveraged the strong top line growth and our continuous improvement efforts to drive significant improvement in total company operating profit and operating margin compared to prior year second quarter. And this performance generated earnings per share growth of 54% compared to the prior year second quarter with incremental margin of 69% in the quarter. Looking ahead to our third quarter, we are forecasting modest organic growth at the midpoint of our guidance. This guidance is in comparison to a robust period of growth a year ago and in a macroeconomic environment that remains fairly weak. This guidance also reflects timing, where as I noted previously, some orders were pulled into second quarter. Overall, recent customer project activity has remained steady. As the rest of the year plays out, we also stay focused on our initiatives we have previously discussed that will improve normalized operating margin over the prior year. I will speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments, but first, I will turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer to provide more detailed commentary on the current results and our third quarter guidance. Greg? Greg Thaxton : Thank you and good morning to everyone. Second quarter sales of $438 million is an increase of more than 9% from the prior year\u2019s second quarter. This change in sales included an 8% increase in organic volume, a 2% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions and a 1% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year second quarter. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, nearly all of the Adhesive Dispensing segment\u2019s 9% sales volume growth was organic with the first year effect of the WAFO acquisition accounting for less than 1% of the increase. Unfavorable currency translation as compared to the prior year reduced this segment\u2019s sales by less than 1%. This segment\u2019s 9% organic growth is an outstanding level and was driven by strong systems demand and the underlying strength in consumer nondurable end markets. In terms of end markets, organic growth was strong in non-wovens, rigid packaging, general product assembly, injection molding and palletizing. On a geographic basis, the volume growth was led by Europe, U.S. and Japan. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 23% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter, inclusive of a 20% increase in organic volume and a 3% increase related to the first year effect of the Liquidyn and MatriX acquisitions. The 20% increase in organic volume follows the momentum in order rates and strong project activity we talked about during last quarter\u2019s conference call. The increase was driven by significant growth in automated dispensing and test and inspection solutions in electronic end markets and by continued strength in fluid management components for medical and industrial end markets. Customers in Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Americas drove the growth. Sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment decreased 13% compared to the second quarter a year ago and currency reduced sales by about 1% as compared to the prior year. As Mike noted, sales in most product lines were impacted by very challenging comparisons to the prior year. Softness in the U.S. and Japan offset growth in other regions. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company in the second quarter was about 57%. Operating profit in the second quarter was $102 million and operating margin was 23%, an improvement of 4 percentage points from the second quarter a year ago. This performance includes one-time charges of approximately $1.6 million for restructuring initiatives and approximately $400,000 for short-term purchase accounting charges related to the step-up in value of acquired inventory. Excluding these one-time charges, normalized operating margin for the quarter was 24% with very strong incremental margin year-over-year. Though volume leverage is helping, this margin improvement is also the result of our performance enhancement initiatives, where for example, year-over-year spending in the quarter, excluding acquisitions and one-time charges, is down 3% from the prior year. And our segmentation and sourcing efforts are benefiting gross margin. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, reported operating margin in Adhesive Dispensing improved 3 percentage points from the prior year to 28% in the quarter or 29%, excluding approximately $1 million in charges related to continuous improvement restructuring initiatives. Within the Advanced Technology segment, reported operating margin was 24% in the second quarter, an improvement of 5 percentage points from the second quarter a year ago. Normalized operating margin in the current quarter was 25%, excluding approximately $500,000 in charges related to restructuring and short-term purchase accounting charges for acquired inventory. In the Industrial Coating segment, second quarter operating margin was 18% or 19% on a normalized basis to exclude approximately $500,000 in non-recurring charges related to restructuring activities. This is outstanding performance for this segment, especially given the lower level of volume in the current quarter as compared to the same quarter a year ago, where sales mix is benefiting gross margin in the quarter as compared to the prior year. For the total company, net income for the quarter was $71 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.23 or 54% higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. Excluding one-time items, normalized diluted earnings per share were $1.19. We have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share. Second quarter\u2019s EBITDA was $122 million and cash flow from operations was $78 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $65 million, reflecting cash conversion of 92% of net income. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. During the quarter, we distributed approximately $14 million in dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain liquid with net debt to EBITDA at 2.5x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the second quarter. I will now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the third quarter of FY \u201816. We have provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending May 15, 2016, order rates were up 4%. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are up 7%. Order rates were strong in most product lines, driven by the strength in consumer non-durable end markets. Geographically, orders were strong in Asia Pacific, Europe and the U.S., flat in Japan and softer in the Americas. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 4%. These order rates reflect strong demand for automated dispensing and test and inspection solutions for electronics end markets, partially offset by slower demand for surface treatment systems, where comparisons for this product line are very challenging. Demand for fluid management components for medical and industrial end markets was robust. Order rates are up in all regions except Japan. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are down 3%, again impacted by tough comps where order rates at this time last year were up 21% and prior year\u2019s segment sales volume for the third quarter increased 23%. Growth in cold material dispensing systems, powder and liquid coating systems was offset by softness in other product lines. Order rates were positive in Japan, Europe and the U.S. Current customer project activity is steady though it\u2019s difficult to forecast the rate at which these projects become orders. Total company backlog at April 30, 2016, was approximately $302 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year and inclusive of 3% organic growth and 2% growth due to acquisitions. Backlog amounts are calculated at April 30, 2016 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of FY \u201816. We are forecasting sales to increase in the range of 1% to 5% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic volume down 1% to up 3% and 3% growth from the first year effect of acquisitions. The effect of currency translation based on current exchange rates is expected to reduce sales by 1% as compared to the prior year. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect third quarter gross margin to be approximately 56% and operating margin to be approximately 24%. This outlook excludes any one-time non-recurring charges associated with our margin enhancement initiatives. As we indicated last quarter, the size and timing of these non-recurring charges for the remainder of the year is difficult to estimate precisely, though we expect these charges to be well below the amount incurred in FY \u201815. We are estimating third quarter interest expense of about $6 million and effective tax rate of approximately 30%, resulting in third quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.25 to $1.37. The midpoint of this guidance will generate EPS growth of 15% over the prior year third quarter. In addition to the third quarter outlook, the following updates on FY \u201816 full year may be helpful for modeling purposes. For effective tax rate, we are forecasting the full year rate to be about 30% based on current tax law and excluding discrete items. For capital spending in 2016, we are still forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million. With that, I will turn the call back to you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I would like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First and as always, a big thanks to our global team. They continued to perform at a high level and delivered record second quarter performance. The 8% organic growth on the top line was outstanding, which we leverage to drive significant improvement in operating margin and earnings per share compared to the same quarter a year ago. As we look at current backlog, recent order rates and timing of shipments, we are forecasting modest organic growth at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are comparing to a previous [ph] strong organic growth in the third quarter last year and certainly, the current macroeconomic environment remains relatively weak. We are not prepared to offer a forecast beyond the third quarter. Current project activity remains solid in all three segments, which could provide benefit in the latter part of the year. Beyond this near-term view, we continue to execute on activities we expect will drive value for shareholders over the long-term. Specifically, we continue to focus on innovative products, tiering, new applications and emerging market penetration to drive growth. I am also pleased to report that we are making solid progress on our margin enhancement initiative using tools within the Nordson businesses system. During the quarter, we continue to execute on integration and footprint optimization activities within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, including next steps in streamlining operations of the U.S. and Europe. We also took selected actions within the Advanced Technology and Industrial Coating segments to drive greater efficiencies. In summary, we look to deliver a solid third quarter given the current global economic environment. Overall, we remain well positioned to capture growth opportunities when and where they occur and we remain focused on continuous improvement throughout the organization. We also continue to generate strong levels of cash, which provide us with the ability to fund multiple priorities. At this point, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : So the incremental margins, pretty impressive in both Adhesives and Advanced and that seems to be turning over in your guidance, is that just \u2013 is there mix in there or is that just a function of the combination of volume and some of the internal initiatives? Mike Hilton : Well I would say there are three factors. Certainly, the volume helped and so we get significant incremental contributions from that. There are some mix benefits in parts of the segment particularly in say the Advanced Technology area, where we have a strong quarter from a dispense side in that business and medical was very solid as well. But I do see us making progress against our overall goal of improving normalized margins 200 basis points by the end of next year and we have seen significant improvement in the quarter coming from that. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then I think you talked about 300 basis points ahead of the top end of your guidance. So can you maybe try to quantify the pull \u2013 what you saw was pull forward in that upside surprise and where else either product line or geography was surprising you versus your internal forecast? Mike Hilton : Yes. There is probably 200 basis points that were orders we expected to come in, in the second quarter, but to be completed and go out in the third quarter. So 200 basis points of that 300 basis points that we exceeded the top end. And I would say certainly, we saw some of that come through in the advanced technology area as well as a little bit on the Adhesives side. So those are probably two areas where we saw some specific projects that we expected to get in, but we expect that the order time will be such that will be sales in the third quarter. Jeff Hammond : And then the other product lines where you were surprised to the upside? Mike Hilton : Well, I think those are the two main segment areas and in some cases its specific project related. So, we did anticipate these orders, just we felt that they would come in perhaps later in the quarter and then therefore ship out in the third quarter. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks, guys. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Franzreb of Sidoti. Your line is now open. John Franzreb : Good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about the order trends? Are we seeing a change maybe in seasonality in demand specifically in Advanced Technology that we are seeing some pull forward in some of those orders? Mike Hilton : I would say what we are seeing in Advanced Technology particularly for the electronics segment is a concentration within the year on orders. Our customers have helped us to reduce our lead times. And so the concentration order tends to be in the second and third quarter. I am not sure there is a typical pattern, because it really depends on what they are doing from new sort of launch perspective. I would say though that we have made some progress on new applications related to new technology we have introduced. So, as an example, we came out with new dispensing technology from our ASYMTEK business that it\u2019s allowed us to do on way for dispensing. And so we have made some progress on the semiconductor side that we haven\u2019t historically done. So, as customers have gone to stacking chips, there is now potentially an opportunity to do that on the wafer. So that\u2019s been good progress. And then with that, we have also seen an uptick on the x-ray side. So, I would say the general sort of mobile-related cycle is getting more concentrated. Part of our effort is to diversify applications and we are getting some traction there in terms of different types of applications. John Franzreb : Okay. So, how do I reconcile maybe a more concentrated order front in AT with also record backlog? Is there also component to that that\u2019s elongated? Can you talk about that record backlog companywide? Mike Hilton : Well, that\u2019s not just an AT activity, that\u2019s across the mix of businesses. But I would say the typical, if you look at our business, the order patterns typically decelerate through the fourth quarter and through sort of January and then start to pick up and typically reach a peak at the end of third quarter or early fourth quarter. We are seeing that same type of pattern. It can vary a little bit between where the peak is in the third quarter, it could be early, it could be late. So, that\u2019s the challenge based on timing of some of these orders. But we are following a pretty typical pattern I would say this year and we saw a nice progression in order rates throughout the quarter, stepping up the way we expect from a seasonality perspective. John Franzreb : Okay. And one last question regarding mix, given the improvement, I don\u2019t recall hearing you mentioned anything about placement parts had a change in the mix profile. Was that a meaningful number or is it within norms? Mike Hilton : I would say it\u2019s generally within norms. I would say the mix is more within segments and across the segments. So, we had very strong performance across our adhesives business, including our sort of core adhesive packaging and non-wovens. We also in our Advanced Tech had the solid performance in our EFD business, strong performance in medical, in our dispense and the ASYMTEK business had a really strong quarter. So, it\u2019s more of sort of a mix within the product lines and across the segments. It\u2019s not really been much of a parts systems kind of issue in this quarter. John Franzreb : Okay, right. Thank your for taking my question. I will get back into queue. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow-on on the electronics business, we saw orders picking up at the end of, I guess, in February of this year and then it sounds like you are able to turn the business pretty quick when you get a block of orders that come in, in a more concentrated cycle. I wonder what you are thinking about for the back half of this year and into 2017. Is there enough new product development that\u2019s going on with some of the mobile manufacturers in China customers to sustain a positive level of orders? Mike Hilton : Yes, so a couple of comments. So, we did see within the quarter some nice orders from our tiered product structure that same really at the Chinese OEMs. So, we made some good progress with the material orders there. And as I mentioned also, we, in broadening applications like the semiconductor dispense application for the next-gen technology was important. And then on the x-ray side, the acquisition of MatriX has really helped us from an automated x-ray standpoint and we have had real nice penetration in Asia with that automated x-ray platform combining with our leading tube and detector technology. So, we saw nice orders there. And we started to see the typical upturn that we see in components on the mobile side, the general mobile side as well and we would expect to see that continuing through the next quarter. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. And then your guidance you talked about gross margin sequentially down a little bit, I wonder if you could provide some more color on where you see the mix being lighter as the Advanced Tech or just conservatism on the outlook? Greg Thaxton : Yes. Well, this is Greg. That gross margin dilution in the third quarter is pretty typical with the volume growth where we have a heavier mix of systems versus parts. So, it isn\u2019t necessarily a big shift in segment per se, but it\u2019s more a mix of systems versus parts. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Mike Hilton : Yes. We are talking about a fraction of a percent here so. Walter Liptak : Okay. And I have asked you this in the past through the adhesives business continues to be as the core part of your business growing very nicely at that mid to high single-digit rate. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about just the programs and projects in health of new product development and one of those consumer durable customers? Mike Hilton : Yes, so maybe just a couple of comments. Obviously, some of the end markets, some on non-durables side like food have been very pretty solid. We have seen a strong quarter in terms of the diaper side of the business. Some of this is the sort of new products our customers are coming out with, but some of this is new technology in our part giving them the opportunity to recapitalize existing infrastructure. So, we are seeing that recapitalization approach based on our new technology taking off while supporting the new sort of clothing like materials there. And then if you look at our sort of product assembly area, we are seeing some traction on the furniture market with some new applications around laminates and things like that. So, there is a couple of new applications there plus the recap that are helping to drive beyond some of the solid market performance and things like typical food and other packaging opportunities. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Maczka of BB&T. Your line is now open. Kevin Maczka : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Kevin. Kevin Maczka : Can I just piggyback on the Advanced Tech and the 20% organic growth because that was such a strong number when we look back at the order rates in the past five quarters, which haven\u2019t been greater than 8% in any quarter, can you just help explain that a little bit more? I understand the pull ahead, but if that\u2019s only a couple of 100 basis points, how do we go from this anywhere from negative 16 to positive 8 order rate into a plus 20 organic this quarter when there is only a couple of 100 basis points of pull ahead? Mike Hilton : Yes, so a couple of things. I mean, just one comment again. Our customers are compressing sort of the lead times as I talked about, so we can give some lumpiness just as a result of when they are placing their orders, because when they place, they place large quantities ahead of time. But that said, I made a couple of comments earlier where we have made progress in a couple of areas. So one, when you look at the new dispensing technology that we launched in the fall that allows us to provide many more dots at a much smaller size, it\u2019s really enabled us to get into dispensing actually on the wafer as opposed to on the package. So as customers have gone to the three dimensional pack \u2013 three dimensional chips, they are now looking, at least the leading edge guys are looking at doing the wafer and we saw significant orders coming based on that new technology on the dispense side. It\u2019s very sophisticated technology. With that we have also seen some pull along from an inspection standpoint on to the front end wafer side of things. And then one of the benefits of acquiring MatriX is to get a world class automation platform and what we did is combine that with our latest tube and detector technology. And we have got really good traction particularly in Asia with that combined combination of our technology and what the MatriX team brought to us and then the direct strategy we have in Asia. So I would say there is quite a bit of new product contribution coming into the business within the quarter and it\u2019s really based on products that we launched sort of light in the fall that are getting real traction now and helping us to diversify. Then on top of that, the medical business continues to grow dramatically and again that\u2019s also around a new product story. So those combinations I think it really helped and hit in the quarter and should continue to get traction going forward. We are not going to get out of the lumpiness though because we have to do what our customers need and it\u2019s linked to their cycles that we have got very good at ramping up, ramping down to support that. So there is still a lumpiness related particularly to the mobile side of the electronics business. Greg Thaxton : Yes. Kevin, this is Greg. Just to add a couple of comments to that. I would say what we also did see in the quarter of above and beyond what we characterized as project activity that we anticipated to come in but shift during the third quarter. So that clearly benefited second quarter. But what we also saw during the quarter and this would affect within the Advanced Tech segment, both the electronic systems as well as fluid management product lines is a good pace of order activity that came in, in the quarter and got out during the quarter. And I think that highlights what we have seen from our customers\u2019 behavior over the last couple of years is this demand to shorten lead times and we are really good at reacting to those kind of demands. So it was a good pace of order volume that came in during the quarter. So it wasn\u2019t in our order rates or backlog leading into the quarter that we are able to turn around and get out during the quarter as well. Kevin Maczka : Got it, that\u2019s all very helpful. And so then Greg, on that point, 4% order growth in Tech in the quarter, do you expect that to still hold positive and maybe there was some pull ahead there as well or is it just the compressed cycle time where you will see that every quarter now? Greg Thaxton : Well, I think to Mike\u2019s point, we\u2019ll see some lumpiness in those order rates. And in terms of what that demand looks like on a going forward basis, we are at that point in time, as we mentioned, where we tend to get stronger order activity in the cycle over this time period, our second, third quarter that leads to volume shipping in the third and fourth a bit stronger than the first half of the year. One other comment I would make is one \u2013 at least in our electronic systems business area, one of the things that\u2019s moderating sort of the growth is if you recall last year, we had very significant growth in our surface treatment business related to a new application. So we are seeing some new opportunities in that business with other customers that haven\u2019t come forward yet. So we are up against some pretty tough comps there. So the dispense piece and the test and inspection piece look very robust. The service treatment piece is a bit weaker really based on the tough comp in the prior year, but we do have good prospects to spread that technology more broadly, may hit this year or may not hit till next year. Kevin Maczka : Okay, got it. And just finally for me on margin, how much of this strong margin upside we saw this quarter would you attribute to your restructuring savings that you realized versus other continuous improvements in volume leverage and how much of the \u2013 same question on the 200 basis points couple of years, how much of that is just pure restructuring savings? Mike Hilton : Yes. So if I look at this quarter, I would say that probably three quarters of the improvement is the function of the volume leverage in mix and probably one quarter is a function of the sort of the restructuring activity. And I would say year-to-date, we are probably half restructuring, half volume and mix in terms of the margin improvement. I think going forward, significant driver of that margin improvement is restructuring, some of which we have already completed, some of which is yet to complete. So we are \u2013 we suggest that that we will get there by the end of next year. This year is continuing to play out, but we are making good progress. Kevin Maczka : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke of Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning Mike. Good morning Greg. Greg Thaxton : Hi. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Liam. Liam Burke : Mike, in your prepared comments on the Adhesive side, you talked about a couple of polymer applications that were doing well, just overall you have got some revenue growth there, but how is your business performing? Mike Hilton : Liam, it\u2019s improving from where we were last year, but it\u2019s not where we wanted to be yet. I would say the volume is certainly helping. But as you know, we have plans to transform that business. We are in the middle of that and that\u2019s going well today. But we have some more things that we need to do that we will continue to work on in that business. But it\u2019s encouraging to see some volume growth across the different product lines. I would say we are starting to get some indications at least on the more complex films that are sort of OEM channels are starting to see activity there. That\u2019s probably still a \u201817 kind of activity, but we are seeing specialty applications in this quarter. We have seen some good growth across most of the product lines in this quarter, so that\u2019s encouraging. So year-on-year, it will be nice improvement, but we still have ways to go. Liam Burke : And then on ATS, medical continues to be strong, are those kind of growth rates continuing to ramp for you? Mike Hilton : Yes. We are seeing real good progress on the medical business. It\u2019s really linked to broadening the product lines that we have, getting placed well with the new applications. We have got the capacity in place between Colorado and Mexico now to support the growth very effectively. And so we are in good position there and we continued to broaden our portfolio. Liam Burke : Great. Thank you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : Congratulations on the varied success across a number of initiatives there. In the ATS, you mentioned you are not going to get rid of the lumpiness, I am going to take that comment a bit weighted to a quarter-to-quarter dynamic, but in ATS as you build out the adjacencies in the new product platforms over the past few years in capacity, etcetera, would you anticipate a moderation of the impact of the sort of the 2-year mobile cycles that we have seen where you have had the strong kind of even number years and then sort of a pause in the odd number years? Mike Hilton : I would say in the longer run, as things like medical, our general applications and sort of our focus to broaden the customer base, I would say yes. In the short-term, may be in the next year or 2 years, we still could see some swings there because of just the market structure of the key players out there. I like the progress we are making with the Chinese OEMs. As I have talked about in the past, there is still coming of the learning curve from an automation standpoint, but we are making \u2013 we are building some momentum there. And I like the diversification efforts that we have going on like I talked about with the new dispense technology that we just put out there and then of course medical and general applications. So over the long run, it should be less of a factor I would say in the next year or 2 years, it still could be more of a factor. And certainly within the year, we have kind \u2013 it kind of affects some quarter-to-quarter movement. Christopher Glynn : Okay. In terms of mix impacts and things, would you say the \u2013 last year to this year was maybe more than extreme end? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say so, because while we had a tougher year from a dispense standpoint, it was actually down say in the electronics side and we filled in with solid products, but not at the same kind of margin profile. So, that\u2019s fairly extreme. So, I would expect as we continue to broaden the base for that to moderate a bit and that\u2019s a key focus. I mean, obviously, when we take advantage of the growth there and the good customer relationships we have and the benefit that technology can play in delivering sort of leading edge products, so we don\u2019t want to give up on that, but we do have a strong focus to diversify both markets, applications and customers. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And wondering if, did FX help margins at all in terms of favorable movements in production currencies? Greg Thaxton : No, Chris, this is Greg. FX would have had a slight dilutive effect on both gross margin and operating margin. Christopher Glynn : Got it. Thanks, guys. Greg Thaxton : But we are talking \u2013 we are in the 30 basis point, 30, 40 basis point kind of range. Christopher Glynn : Okay, I will mark it down as 35. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt McConnell of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt McConnell : Thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Good morning. Matt McConnell : Could we talk about capital allocation and what you are seeing in the M&A pipeline, what the priorities are and seller expectations? And whether there is anything that you think could be actionable in the next couple of quarters? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say overall, our priorities at the highest level are the same, support organic growth first, keep our dividends string going. Second, offset dilution. Third, there is relatively modest. So, then it comes down to the M&A activity that you are pointing out and then what else we might do opportunistically from the share side. And I would say couple of things. We did say we were going to take a little bit of a breather here in the first part of the year to continue to complete the latest integrations and the kind of work down our leverage a little bit and we are doing that. I would say the pipeline out there still tends to be smaller opportunities in some of our businesses with the exception of medical, where there are smaller opportunities than potentially a couple of larger ones. So, I would say that\u2019s the area probably where there is more opportunities. Timing is always questionable. I would say pricing is still fairly robust. So, it\u2019s still relatively a sellers market at the moment. And that varies in terms of the kind of opportunities that you are looking at, whether it\u2019s a product tuck-in versus something more substantial. So, we see a pretty robust pipeline in general, typically smaller deals with the potential of some larger ones in the medical side. It\u2019s hard to predict when they might come forward or come to market. Some of them \u2013 a lot of them tend to be private owners and that\u2019s always tough to judge. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Hey, good morning. Just a couple of questions. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Matt Summerville : Most of mine have been answered. Within the Adhesive Dispensing business, I went back I mean I have to go back to 2012 kind of margins as high as it was here in Q2 at around and I think 29%. Is this sort of the signal that you can get this thing back to the 30% plus where it used to be of these flex pack businesses and I will just aggregate them into one kind of lumps and all of those businesses now systematically improve their profitability such that the magnitude of dilution has come in meaningfully? Mike Hilton : So, I would say, directionally, you are correct, we are improving. I mean, we have taken action across the segments and in terms of some restructuring and then you are seeing some of that improvement come through. As I mentioned a little while ago, we still have some work to do in terms of realizing all of the benefits on the plastic side from improvements and some of the restructuring that we have underway. And of course, then there is volume leverage as that comes back. So as we have said, I think in the past our goal is to get that segment up to the 30% margin plus point. The specific timing is still probably a couple of years out when you think about it on an annual basis. We can have quarters, I think where we will be approaching that, but on an annual basis, it\u2019s still probably a couple of years out when we complete all of the efforts that we have ongoing in our plastics business. But directionally, we are moving with improvements across all elements of the business. Matt Summerville : As I think about your restructuring, you mentioned the progress we are making. Maybe can you get a little more specific in terms of what kind of magnitude of headcount reductions that have been completed, what needs to be done? If you have exited rooftops, how many and how many more are there? And then just lastly, what can make that 200 basis points, 300 or 400 as you have gotten in and rolled up the sleeves a little bit more here? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, what \u2013 just a couple of high level comments. Overall, we talked about getting out of one facility in the Netherlands. We talked about consolidating multiple German facilities into a single facility. We are on process to do that. We have talked about other consolidation in our dies business in the U.S. We are in process to do that. We still have some additional consolidation to do as well. Some of that is dependent on expansions in other places. So in other words, there is an expansion in one site and consolidation in other. So, we have got a very thoughtful plan on how to do that. So, we have multiple phases here. I would say we are well into probably complete \u2013 almost complete in the first phase and we have some other things that we are working on. Really not going to comment anymore specifically on that until those plans are more fully fleshed out and communicated, but we are making good progress there. We have seen the benefits that we expected to see from the actions that we have taken. And we have taken actions across the business, not just in the plastics area reflecting sort of the softer environment, we are seeing from a macro standpoint and our desire to make that structural improvement in margins. So, it\u2019s not just a plastics activity, it\u2019s across multiple businesses. If you recall last year in our EFD business, we consolidated in Europe, exited a facility. And in the medical business, we expanded in Colorado, got out of manufacturing in Minnesota. We are expanding in Mexico to support our assembly operations. So, these are the supply chain moves we are making outside of just the plastics area. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Brady of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Charles Brady : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning. Charles Brady : So, on the orders again, not to beat the dead horse, but I am going to anyway. So, the plus 4% in the quarter, I want to go back to your comment about some of the velocity of the incoming order and exit order rate, because if you do the math on the backlog and the sales numbers, it sounds like in the quarter itself ending April, of course, your 12 weeks on a two-week lag, but for the quarter, it sounds like you are close to 7.5% order growth in the actual quarter ending April and then for the 12-week on that two-week lag, you dropped to 4%. And I am just trying to understand, that\u2019s a function of your velocity of the orders coming in exiting in the quarter, because you are having compressed time segments with the customers on Advanced Tech? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Charlie, this is Greg. I think you have got it to suggest that kind of during the quarter as we entered the quarter, order rates have been up 1%, coming into the second quarter. We saw good demand activity during the quarter clearly that helped drive this performance, sales performance in the second quarter and it\u2019s a snapshot. So, you get variability from week-to-week, but as we looked at where those order rates were the latest 12 weeks, we are up 4%. So, that would suggest that we had some strong pace during the quarter that moderated a bit towards the end of the quarter. Mike Hilton : The other thing as you look out you are comparing against a pretty strong quarter into Q3 of last year and so the comparable is maybe a little bit tougher as well. Charles Brady : Yes, no, fair point. I am not going to try to downplay the order growth. I guess my point is a lot of that stuff tends to be very short cycle, you may get an order tomorrow, it\u2019s going to go out in a week, so you don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming in today and that 4% may actually be understating some of the underlying growth you are seeing in the businesses just from your commentary you have been making? Mike Hilton : Yes. I mean, I think we are trying to give you the best snapshot that we have. I mean, as Greg said, if you went into last quarter, our backlog was pretty solid at 8%. The order rate was a little softer. We had some guidance that was kind of in the middle and the order rate picked up. Here we are a quarter later the backlog is a little softer. The order rate is pretty solid. We are giving you our best estimate. But as you have just said, we got a lot of business that comes in and out in a relatively short period of time in a matter of weeks. We have a good view of the project activity and the list associated with it. Our customers aren\u2019t always as clear on their expectations, both in the placement of the order and the delivery. And so that can move around. So, we are good at dealing with that. It does make it a little more challenging to forecast. Charles Brady : Yes, sure. And so just switching gears on Adhesive Dispensing for a second, I thought I heard you say in your commentary that the non-wovens was one of the areas of strength in the quarter. And that tends to be your lower margin business and yet that segment had phenomenal margins. So, I am just trying can you comment of what the mix of that non-woven is and is underlying margin in that particular piece of the business gotten meaningfully better? Mike Hilton : So, just first comment, the non-wovens business is a good business for us. So, I wouldn\u2019t categorize it as low margin business first of all. Secondly, what I would say is there is lot of change there that\u2019s driving kind of nice growth. So, from an overall mix standpoint, I think what we have talked about in the past, we have sort of three areas in that sort of more traditional adhesives business, the packaging piece which tends to be our highest and then the non-wovens in the product assembly and that sort of order the product assembly takes more of an integrated systems approach and so the margins tend to be a little bit lower. They are all good margins though. Charles Brady : Yes, no, I didn\u2019t mean to suggest that I guess my point was historically it\u2019s been a lumpier business and sometimes when the mix on non-wovens is higher, the overall margin is a little softer than otherwise would be if the mix has been lower. But it sounds like that\u2019s not really having that kind of impact right now? Mike Hilton : Because the other two components are also pretty strong. Charles Brady : Got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. Mike Hilton : Alright. With no further questions, I want to thank everyone for participating in the call. We appreciate your support. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. If you require operator assistance during the program, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for this conference call, Mr. Jim Jaye. You may begin, sir. Jim Jaye : Good morning. This is Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations. I\u2019m here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO, and Greg Thaxton, Senior Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, August 23, 2016 to report on Nordson\u2019s FY16 third quarter results and our fourth quarter outlook. The conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until August 30, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 58265387. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we\u2019ll have a question and answer session, but now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for an overview of our FY16 third quarter results and a bit about our fourth quarter outlook. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the third quarter. We delivered record performance for any quarter in our history in terms of revenue, operating profit, net income, and diluted earnings per share. My thanks go out to our global team for their continued hard work and customer focus. Greg will provide a bit more of the financial details shortly, but first I\u2019d like to mention just a few of the highlights for the quarter. On the top line, we grew the business by 6% in the quarter compared to the prior year, slightly above the high end of our guidance and inclusive of 4% organic growth. This is very solid performance in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The diversity of our end markets continues to be a strength and our team is capturing growth opportunities in a variety of niches where customers are responding to our value proposition and our new product offerings. Growth was especially strong this quarter in electronics, medical, and consumer non-durable end markets. We also generated growth across most of our geographies. We leveraged the revenue growth and our continuous improvement efforts to increase total company operating profit by 20% and operating margin by 3 percentage points, both as compared to prior year\u2019s third quarter. Incremental operating margin was 77% in the quarter and diluted earnings per share grew by 28% compared to the same period last year. As we look to our fourth quarter, we are forecasting mid-to-high single digit organic growth compared to a year ago. Our backlog and order rates are very solid, and customer project activity in all three segments is steady. We expect volume leverage in our ongoing operational initiatives to drive operating margin improvements as compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. At the low end of our fourth quarter guidance, we\u2019re on track for a record full-year performance. I\u2019ll speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments, but first let me turn the call over to Greg for a more detailed commentary on the current results and our fourth quarter guidance. Greg? Gregory Thaxton : Thank you and good morning to everyone. As Mike noted, we increased sales by 6% in the quarter over the prior year\u2019s third quarter, with sales of $490 million. This change in sales included a 4% increase in organic volume, a 2% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions, and a less than 1% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year third quarter. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, organic sales volume in adhesive dispensing increased 4% compared to the prior year with additional volume growth of 1% related to the first year effect of the WAFO acquisition. Strength in consumer non-durable and general product assembly markets in the current quarter helped drive solid organic growth in this segment. Geographically, Europe and the U.S. led the growth. Organic sales volume in the advanced technology segment increased 6% compared to the prior year third quarter, with additional volume growth of 5% related to the first year effect of the Liquidyn and MatriX acquisitions. The organic growth was driven by strong demand for automated and semi-automated dispense equipment in electronic end markets and fluid management components for medical end markets. Geographically, Japan, Asia Pacific, and the United States led the growth. Sales volume in the industrial coatings segment decreased 3% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Sales were impacted by very challenging comparisons to the prior year where volume growth was 23% at this time last year. Strength in powder and liquid coating product lines was offset by softness in other product lines. Growth in Europe and the United States was offset by other geographies. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company in the third quarter was 56%, a 2 percentage point improvement from last year\u2019s third quarter driven largely by volume leverage and product mix. Operating profit was $124 million and operating margin was 25%, an improvement of 3 percentage points from the third quarter a year ago. This improvement was driven by both volume leverage and a range of continuous improvement initiatives. Excluding one-time charges of approximately $1.7 million for restructuring initiatives, total company operating margin was 26% in the quarter. On a segment basis, reported operating margin in the adhesive dispensing segment improved 1 percentage point from the prior year to 27% in the quarter or 28% on a normalized basis to exclude approximately $800,000 in charges related to restructuring initiatives. Within the advanced technology segment, reported operating margin was 31% in the quarter, an improvement of 7 percentage points from the third quarter a year ago. This is very strong performance where volume leverage, sales mix, and continuous improvement initiatives combined to drive the improvement. In the industrial coating segment, third quarter operating margin was 17% or 18% on a normalized basis to exclude approximately $900,000 in charges related to restructuring initiatives. This is continued strong performance for this segment, especially given the lower level of volume in the current quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. For the total company, net income for the quarter was $84 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.46 or 28% higher than last year\u2019s third quarter. Excluding one-time items, normalized diluted earnings per share were $1.47. We have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share. The third quarter\u2019s EBITDA was $139 million and cash flow from operations was $68 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $48 million. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by an increase in working capital mostly related to the timing of receivable collections. We expect free cash flow in the fourth quarter to trend back to our more typical cash conversion levels. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends, and during the quarter we distributed approximately $14 million in dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain liquid with net debt to EBITDA at 2.3 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the third quarter. I\u2019ll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter. We have provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis, with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending August 14, 2016, order rates are up 16% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the adhesive dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are up 2% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Comparisons are challenging here, where this segment\u2019s orders rates were up 12% at this time a year ago. Order rates in the current period were driven by strong demand in our general product assembly and rigid packaging product lines. Geographically, orders were strongest in Asia Pacific. In the advanced technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 29% as compared to the prior year. Mobile and related electronics end markets drove the orders with strong demand for our automated and semi-automated dispense systems, test and inspection equipment, and surface treatment systems. Demand was also strong in most of our medical fluid management product lines. Geographically, order rates were driven by Japan and Asia Pacific. Within the industrial coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 36% as compared to the prior year. Orders increased by double digits in all product lines, driven by demand in automotive and consumer durable end markets. Geographically, orders were up by double digits in all regions except Europe. Backlog at July 31, 2016 was approximately $333 million, an increase of 22% compared to the prior year and inclusive of 20% organic growth and 2% growth due to acquisitions. Backlog amounts are calculated at July 31, 2016 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We are forecasting sales to increase in the range of 6% to 10% as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic volume up 5% to 9%, and 1% growth from the first year effective acquisitions. The effective currency translation based on current exchange rates is expected to be minimal as compared to the prior year. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect fourth quarter gross margin to be approximately 54%. Excluding any non-recurring charges, which we expect will be less than what we incurred in the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter, we are forecasting operating margin to be approximately 22% at the midpoint of our sales forecast, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.27. The midpoint of this guidance would generate normalized earnings per share growth of 27% over the prior year fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, we\u2019re estimating fourth quarter interest expense of about $5 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 30%. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you, Mike. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, I\u2019d like to provide a few summary comments. Clearly Nordson is outperforming the current macroeconomic environment. We are benefiting from the diversity of our end markets and capturing growth with innovative products, tiering new applications, emerging market penetration, and recapitalization of our installed base. We\u2019re leveraging that growth to widen margins and increase profitability. Independent of volume, we\u2019re also continuing to use tools in the Nordson business system to drive improvement across the enterprise. We\u2019re on track to deliver full-year records for revenue, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share. At the midpoint of our guidance, full-year organic sales growth would be approximately 5% compared to the prior year. We expect full-year operating margin to improve compared to the prior year, given volume leverage on this growth and the benefits of this year\u2019s margin enhancement initiatives. At this point, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Hi guys, good morning. Michael Hilton : Good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Could you give us maybe a little bit more color on the performance of advanced technology this quarter in terms of--you know, I know you mentioned medical as well as the technology, but was it weighted one over the other this quarter more so, or were they fairly balanced? Michael Hilton : Well, I\u2019d say this quarter both elements of the business were strong. Obviously in the segment, the non-medical piece is probably three-quarters of the segment, so that\u2019s had a significant effect. What we\u2019ve seen is a couple of things : a continuation of what we saw last quarter in terms of new products creating new opportunities for us, but also it took up on the mobile side of the business across both the semi-automated and the automated dispense and then the ensuing inspection-related activities. So I\u2019d say certainly a lot of weight in this quarter coming from the mobile side of things and the broadening of our applications base and opportunities related to new products, while medical continued to be strong. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s great. Then just looking at the core sales growth range for Q4, it\u2019s pretty wide. Is it relative to maybe some projects that might, just given timing, get pushed into the following quarter? Can you just help clarify that a little bit, the wide range there? Michael Hilton : Yes, we take a look at the mix of projects that we have in, and for some of our businesses there are deliveries that stretch a little bit longer based on when they come into orders. So you\u2019re exactly right thinking that some of those could end up being in the fourth quarter--or I mean, the first quarter. Allison Poliniak : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Matt McConnell : Thank you, good morning. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Matt McConnell : Just wanted to touch on the guidance for the margin next quarter. You\u2019ve pretty handily beaten your expectations a couple quarters in a row, and the 22% you\u2019re guiding to would be a pretty big sequential step-down and probably bigger than you would typically see from 3Q to 4Q. So is there something in the mix or is that just conservatism? Again, I know you\u2019ve been exceeding your expectations. Really just hoping to understand that step down. Michael Hilton : Yes, I would say part of it is just looking at overall volume expectations, but in actuality also the mix. So if you look at it as an example, this is a strong quarter with order entry on the coatings business, which has been a little softer against tough comps for most of the year, and so the mix of that business will have an effect coming into the fourth quarter for example. So really when we look at it, it\u2019s really more a function of volume mix than anything else, and that\u2019s our best estimate at this point in time. Gregory Thaxton : This is Greg. I\u2019d just add to Mike\u2019s comments where we may see some segment mix, we may see some product line mix within the segments as well, that although still good margin would be dilutive to what we delivered in the third quarter. So it\u2019s primarily mix. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. Thanks. Then maybe switching gears, product assembly has been quite strong for a number of quarters now. Can you just give us a sense of the markets that are driving that? I know that\u2019s an area within adhesive dispensing where it\u2019s a bit more wide open with respect to your growth opportunities, so how do you prioritize those growth opportunities going forward, and maybe what\u2019s been the recent driver of that product assembly growth? Michael Hilton : Yes, there are a number of different applications that fall into that. Certainly some of them fall into the category driven by housing and construction, some of them relate to industrial machinery that are related to really consumer non-durable demand and the step-up in consumer non-durable demand. I think some of it also is a function of a nice set of tiered offerings that we\u2019ve put in place to take advantage of some new opportunities, particularly in emerging markets. I\u2019d say we have a variety of things there that are picking up. Our focus is really around particular opportunities where we can create value and ultimately obviously get paid for the value we create. Matt McConnell : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Matt Summerville : Good morning, a couple questions. If you could just talk about or maybe calibrate, dial in if you will, the three segments around that 5% to 9% organic growth expectation you have in Q4, maybe which you expect to be within that bandwidth, above or below that, and just kind of--I guess I\u2019m trying to tie that back into some of the big order numbers you\u2019ve put up in two of the three businesses, please. Michael Hilton : Yes, if you look at it and just look at the order entries across the business, Greg talked about the two in particular that have stepped up significantly in this quarter - the advanced tech piece and the coatings piece, where the adhesive piece has been more steady. So I would say when you look at the quarter going out, you\u2019re going to see more of the contributions coming from advanced tech and the coatings, and I guess on an order entry basis, I\u2019d make a couple of comments. Particularly in the coatings business, I think a lot of those are going to consumer durable type applications. Some customers, given the macro scenario, were hesitant early in the year, and they\u2019ve released some funds now, so we\u2019re seeing a relatively strong push towards year-end. I\u2019d say on the advanced tech side, our peak can shift from third quarter to fourth quarter from year to year, and it\u2019s a little bit later this year as well, so that\u2019s contributing to the order step-up. In both of those cases, some of those orders could conceivably get pushed into the first quarter, so that\u2019s kind of a reflection. The adhesives business is more steady, and as Greg mentioned, in the fourth quarter we\u2019re up against tougher comps from a year ago - still ahead of those, but up against tougher comps. Matt Summerville : If you look at the average duration of how long an order is staying in backlog, is that number materially different now than it has been in prior years? And I guess as your visibility--when you look at that backlog number, up 20% organically, that\u2019s a pretty big number. Do you feel like your visibility today is better than it has been in the past, just given the general shorter cycle nature of your business? Michael Hilton : Yes, I would say the average duration hasn\u2019t changed significantly. I mean, we have projects in the coatings business that are significant that could stretch out a little bit. We could have projects in the product assembly area that we just talked about that could stretch out a little bit, and in our plastics business we could have some projects that are a little bit longer, but I would say not dramatically different. I would say what we have seen more recently is some bigger orders coming in and sort of packages with staged deliveries, and some of those things can play out over time, so that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing as well. Matt Summerville : Got it, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Charlie Brady : Good morning, guys. Michael Hilton : Morning, Charlie. Charlie Brady : I\u2019ll ask my standard question on mix of parts and aftermarket consumables in the quarter. Any skewing one way or the other? I mean, the margins were pretty good. I\u2019m wondering if that was helped at all by the mix of that aftermarket component. Gregory Thaxton : Yes Charlie, this is Greg. Not materially different, but I will say as compared to the prior year third quarter, that mix actually hurt us a little bit, where parts revenue was down from where it was 41% of the mix last year, it was 39% in the current quarter. So not materially different, but would be a slight drag on gross margins. Charlie Brady : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. In the release, you talked about Europe was actually up in industrial and in adhesive dispensing. Can you just talk about--you know, obviously with all the Brexit discussion going on out there and some of the growth expectations, you\u2019re still seeing growth in Europe. Can you talk about how you saw that through the quarter, and really more importantly, exiting the quarter and kind of given the timing of when your fiscal year ends, what you\u2019re seeing out of Europe, any material change or hesitancy on customer order patterns. Michael Hilton : Yes, I\u2019d say if you look at across most of the businesses, I\u2019d say we saw Europe as modestly up, probably most solid in our traditional kind of adhesives business. Now remember, also in Europe we\u2019ve got large OEMs that export elsewhere, so that\u2019s one of the positive things that is affecting our business and might be a little different than what you might see in some other businesses. But I\u2019d say generally speaking, pretty solid, modestly above year-on-year, and when you look at our coatings business in particular, we\u2019ve had solid powder opportunities in Europe and we\u2019re starting to see that pick up more globally for the coatings business. So I would say the combination of the OEMs and key adhesive applications and some pick-up in the coatings business is what\u2019s really been driving the revenue. Now when you look at the orders going forward, Europe looks a little bit weaker and maybe more in line with what you\u2019ve seen with some other companies there. I\u2019d say for us, it\u2019s really more of a function of timing of some large projects year-over-year and not so much an underlying trend. So we haven\u2019t seen a Brexit effect at this point in time. It doesn\u2019t mean something couldn\u2019t come down the road, but we haven\u2019t seen that at this point. Charlie Brady : Thanks Mike, appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael Hilton : Good morning, Walt. Walter Liptak : I wanted to just drill into the advanced tech a little bit. You called out mobile electronics, and it sounds like mostly in Japan and Asia. What kind of applications, are these for new products, new mobile devices that will be coming out later this year? Michael Hilton : Yes, so a couple of things. We--from an application standpoint, I\u2019d say there\u2019s sort of two things that are driving, and maybe three. So we came out with some new technology on the dispense side that will allow us to put more dot smaller size, which widens the application approach to get to the wafer side of things. We talked a little bit about that last quarter, and that\u2019s continued. We\u2019re seeing those new products get traction. We\u2019re also seeing some new applications in the mobile side which one example is more waterproofing or water resistant type of applications that are driving some opportunities. On our inspection side, the three dimensional chips and three dimensional wafers are driving X-ray inspection, and then we\u2019ve done a nice job with tiering. You know, we talked about an acquisition we made about a year and a half ago in Europe that would allow us to get a tiered product that we then incorporated our technology on, and we\u2019re getting nice traction in that tiered product offering on the dispense side. Then we also had an acquisition where we\u2019re getting really good traction in Asia by incorporating our X-ray technology onto an automation platform. So those are some examples of the kinds of things that we\u2019re seeing that are helping diversify the base of applications and customers. Walter Liptak : Yes, the diversification sounds great. Is this--you know, your advanced tech orders, because of that mobile part, have been lumpy from time to time because of some of the early stages of the some of the new applications. Do you think there\u2019ll be maybe more consistency as you go? Is there any more visibility going out for your six months on projects? Michael Hilton : I would say that unfortunately no, there\u2019s not more visibility going out, and this business will continue to be lumpy. Certainly I think the tiered offering, getting to a different group of customers like, for example, the Chinese mobile players will be helpful because they\u2019re earlier on in the automation curve. But we\u2019ll still see product cycles, and as we look out on the mobile front, we typically see the design cycles from fall through early winter and then orders come through, and based on the degree of change, we\u2019ll see more come through. I\u2019d say what we\u2019re doing to diversify some of these other applications that should be more steady because they apply to a broader set of opportunities, and the tiering should help because it\u2019s earlier on in the penetration curve for some of the folks that are just automating, but there will still be lumpiness with this business. Walter Liptak : Okay. All right, understood. It sounds great. On the margins that expanded in advanced tech, you called out mix, volume, and continuous improvement. I was wondering about the medical margins. Are medical there? You\u2019ve gone through some restructuring and I think improvement with those businesses. Are those sustainable margins now on the medical side? Michael Hilton : Yes, on the medical side, we\u2019ve grown. First of all, we\u2019ve grown the business nicely across all the three major product lines that we have there, and we have put the new automated facility out in Colorado and that\u2019s ramping up, and we also expanded our facility in Mexico for the cannula catheter business and some other things that we\u2019re doing there, so those are all nice structural improvements that are helping, so the margins are improving in that area as well. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. The last thing, you haven\u2019t mentioned the polymers business. The kind of general industrial trends have been bumpy, or maybe improving a little bit. Are you seeing any improvement in polymers? Michael Hilton : Yes, I would say it\u2019s been kind of a mixed bag. We\u2019ve seen some improvements, for example in our dies business, which are related more the film, which has been the laggard for the last couple of years. We\u2019ve seen some good performance in our melt delivery, which is the German business. I\u2019d say our core components, which are the screws and barrels, have been a little soft as some of the injection molding applications have slowed a little bit, and the palletizing has been generally solid but it\u2019s bigger project-related, so it can bounce around quarter to quarter. But we\u2019re seeing a pick-up, I\u2019d say in the orders entry in general in the business. I\u2019d say the one softness we\u2019re seeing is around some slowing in the injection molding side with some improvement on the film side, so a mixed bag still. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. All right, thank you. Operator : Again ladies and gentlemen, if you have a question or a comment at this time, please press star then the one key on your touchtone telephone. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Good morning. Just building on Walt\u2019s questions, wondering how some of the emergent mix penetration stories are scaling up in terms of maybe quantifying the incremental revenue opportunity? There\u2019s the test and inspection applications, tier 2 mobile, and even Freedom is still a penetration story. I think those are the chunkier ones. If you could kind of quantify how you\u2019re seeing the multi-year market sizes there. Michael Hilton : Yes, I\u2019d say at this point in time, if you look at sort of the range of mobile-related activities, both on the dispense and the inspection side, we\u2019re seeing revenues that fall in the tens of millions of dollars, maybe 10, 20, $30 million range, not hundreds of millions. So I\u2019d say on the newer technology, we\u2019re still early on in the penetration curve, but as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we see these things are kind of singles and doubles and not home runs. On the adhesives side, I would say a similar kind of thing in that we\u2019ve seen good sales on the Freedom side. We\u2019ve seen much better sales on the Liberty side, which is more of a drop-in replacement with the same sort of melt-on-demand characteristics and automated feed systems, and that\u2019s been strong for us. A significant portion of those--combinations of those two have been a significant portion of our new orders, probably approaching 50% of our new orders for those type of technologies. Gregory Thaxton : Just to comment there, Chris, a way to think about that particularly with adhesives, is often that\u2019s a reason for a customer to upgrade existing lines. Christopher Glynn : Right, okay. Then overall, your trends have been so broad-based here, I think with Nordson there\u2019s always some competing concepts of your broad portfolio execution and then some of the streakiness that characterizes some of your businesses. So as we think about the broadening impact, how would you take the recent success in understanding the flow-through into your base run rates to ponder fiscal \u201917 and \u201918 in an absolute sense, relative to what you\u2019re seeing now? Michael Hilton : Okay, let me take a stab at that. I mean, if you go back to the macro here for a second, we still look at the underlying macro for this year of global GDP growth to be in the low 2%, so we\u2019re clearly outperforming the global GDP and that\u2019s really a function of our overall business model and the importance of technology and support and service to that. So if we come in at our expectation for the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be about 5% organic growth through the year, which is pretty stellar relative to, I think, most other people and above that sort of 2% GDP growth. You\u2019re right that we do have lumpiness in some cycles in some of the business. I think the benefit of our portfolio is when one is a little softer, like the coatings business has been this year, albeit against some tough comps, the other parts of the business have been able to pick that up so net-net we\u2019re ahead. It\u2019s not obvious to us at this point, and it\u2019s early to proscribe, that the global economy is going to look at lot different next year. I don\u2019t know beyond next year, so we\u2019re planning for low growth and we\u2019re going to continue to drive our initiatives that try and go beyond whatever the market is going to give us. So that\u2019s more new products, it\u2019s driving the tiering opportunities across a lot of our businesses, it\u2019s new applications that we\u2019re working on in effect to create our own demand. So that\u2019s the focus of our business, is to outperform the global economy largely through our own initiatives that create demand, and that\u2019s sort of been our success to date and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for going forward. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks. Last one here, in your comments, you talked about growth reflecting leveraging your technology, service, and global footprint. I\u2019m interested in the service component of that comment. Are you seeing opportunities for new strategies and opportunities on the service side broadly in your bigger picture business model? Michael Hilton : I would say we\u2019re not seeing as much change in the service side, other than to say that\u2019s a critical element of our business. When you look at our customers, the most important thing for most all of our customers is to continue to be up and running. We certainly have the most robust products out there, which helps, but they do go down from time to time and then it\u2019s important to have the robust supply chain to provide the parts, but also the engineers and technicians that can go onsite and help them get up and running as quickly as possible. We do offer various forms of preventative maintenance and other types of programs, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s really about helping our customers maximize their uptime and optimize their performance. Christopher Glynn : Sounds good, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew Trusz with Gabelli. Matthew Trusz : Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first, given how strong you guys have been doing on the profitability front throughout 2016, it looks like at your current fourth quarter guidance, you\u2019ll be achieving your 200 basis point margin expansion about a year early. So as we look longer term over the next three or five years, how much more opportunity do you think you have to drive profitability higher, and what do you think the primary sources will be? Michael Hilton : Yes, so maybe just a couple of comments. Obviously we do have strong incremental margins, so with volume growth that we\u2019re seeing this year and some mix improvement, particularly I\u2019d say in the advanced tech area or dispense, relative to some of the other applications, we\u2019re getting the benefit that\u2019s influencing that overall, what you\u2019ve calculated, 200 basis points improvement. Our view is based on our sort of constant volume goal to be at 200 basis points by the end of \u201917. We\u2019re probably about two-thirds of the way there, assuming we come in in the fourth quarter at expectations. So we\u2019re not 100% of the way there. There\u2019s certainly some more opportunity we need to deliver next year, and we have actions and plans in place to do that, but we\u2019re also getting the benefit of volume leverage. So our commitment was to get to that 200 basis points without the benefit of volume. What we\u2019re seeing this year obviously is improvement on that path but also the benefit of volume and some mix as well. Longer term, we will continue to identify opportunities to improve and we\u2019ve got strong continuous improvement activity, but we haven\u2019t put any other sort of goals out there beyond \u201917 from a non-volume related margin standpoint at this point. Matthew Trusz : All right, great. Thanks for the color. Then I guess if we just sort of shift towards M&A, it\u2019s been a while since your last deal. Net leverage continues to come down. How active is your pipeline? Are there any particular areas of opportunity you\u2019re seeing, and how good are you feeling over the next couple quarters? Michael Hilton : Yes, so you\u2019re correct - we have consciously worked this year to reduce our leverage to create some opportunity or capability to do some additional acquisitions. I think as we\u2019ve talked in the past, the most fertile areas are in the medical device space, and we\u2019ve got a pretty solid pipeline there. I\u2019d say in the cold material area, there are a number of interesting opportunities, timing is not clear. On the plastic side, we pretty much have what we need for the moment, and we continue to look for opportunities on the test and inspection side in the advanced technology area, but we\u2019ve added some nice complements over the next year through acquisition and through marketing arrangements, so we feel pretty good. I would say there are a number of things that we looked at this year that we were actively pursuing, but we\u2019ve walked away when pricing got to a point that it didn\u2019t make sense for us. Matthew Trusz : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason Rodgers : Good morning. Wondered if there was any benefit from lower raw material costs in the quarter, and if you\u2019re seeing any material change in cost so far in the fourth quarter. Michael Hilton : No, nothing that would be material in the grand scheme of things, either in the quarter or looking forward. Jason Rodgers : What\u2019s the expectation for the tax rate for the fourth quarter, and any kind of early indications for next fiscal year? Thank you. Gregory Thaxton : Yes, we\u2019ve suggested a 30% rate for the fourth quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Summerville with Alembic Global. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a quick kind of follow-up on the M&A side of things. You mentioned some multiples sort of getting out of control. Can you quantify that? I mean, are you talking about high single to low double digit multiples that have now moved into the low to mid-teens kind of range? And then I guess you were active, I believe, in fiscal Q1 buying back stock. I don\u2019t believe you did any in fiscal Q2, and I don\u2019t recall you mentioning anything in the prepared remarks for fiscal Q3, so what\u2019s sort of the outlook there given your stock\u2019s been up very nicely this year? What\u2019s the outlook there and the prioritization as you\u2019re looking at things? I guess at the end of the day, are you saving up for a bigger deal at this point? Michael Hilton : So Matt, just a couple of comments. If you go back probably a couple years and compare kind of where we are today from an M&A standpoint versus a couple years, I\u2019d say in general properties are a turn higher maybe in multiples, maybe a turn and a half, and it\u2019s really a function of very low interest rates and, quite frankly, strategics with a lot of cash on the sideline, so number one. Number two in terms of our overall priorities from a capital deployment, they still remain the same, which is number one, support organic growth; number two, continue our dividend increase approach, which we just recently announced and we\u2019re on a good payout range there; number three, offset dilution from our comp programs, which is pretty modest; number four, look for the appropriate M&A vehicles; and then five would be opportunistically look at additional share repurchase. So in terms of the M&A activity, we do have an active pipeline. It\u2019s probably most active in the medical space, as I mentioned, and we\u2019re looking for opportunities there but we\u2019ve said consciously this year, given the acquisitions we made and the aggressive nature of our share buyback opportunistically last year, that we wanted to work down our balance sheet, so we did modest share repurchase in the first fiscal quarter, we didn\u2019t do any in Q2, we didn\u2019t do any in Q3. The first quarter offsets the dilution piece and some for our comp programs, so the priority is still to work down the balance sheet to give us capacity to make some additional acquisitions. Matt Summerville : Got it, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Walter Liptak : Hi guys. Just wanted to follow up on the fourth quarter bonus comp. Considering the strong third quarter and then what looks to be a good fourth quarter, have you been accruing at the same level throughout the year, or is there going to be a step-up in the fourth? Gregory Thaxton : Walt, this is Greg. We\u2019ve been accruing throughout the year based upon our performance. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Thank you. Jim Jaye : Kevin, this is Jim. Maybe we have time for one more question or so, if anybody else is on the line. Operator : Sir, that was the last question in the queue. Michael Hilton : Okay, well thank you all for dialing into our call, and I\u2019m available for follow-ups throughout today and the rest of the week. Again, thanks for your interest in Nordson. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations, sir you may begin. Jim Jaye : Thank you Kelly, and happy holidays to everybody listening. I am here today with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, December 14, 2016 Nordson\u2019s FY16 Fourth quarter results and our FY17 first quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until December 21, 2016, which can be accessed by calling 44-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 25973581. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we\u2019ll have a question and answer session. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike for an overview of our FY16 fourth quarter results and a bit about the first quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. First I would like to thank our global team for their outstanding work not just in the fourth quarter but for the whole year for sales, operating profit and earnings per share were all full year records for Nordson. Looking at the fourth quarter, our record sales were driven by organic growth of 13% compared to the same period a year ago. All three segments in most geographies contributed to this growth. Our team did a great job leveraging this increased volume and focusing on continuous improvement initiatives to improve our operating margin by five percentage points compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 56% over the same period. Other highlights in the quarter include the acquisition of LinkTech Quick Couplings, which adds to our medical offering and an increased our annual dividend for the 53rd consecutive year. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was a great way to end the year and one of the very strong year for Nordson. Nordson\u2019s momentum continues as we began the New Year. Our backlog is up significantly from the same time a year ago and our 12-week order rates are positive in all geographies and segments. In a few moments, I\u2019ll offer some additional perspective on our performance, the macroeconomic environment and our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. But first, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg who will provide more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter and our first quarter guidance. Greg. Gregory Thaxton : Thank you Mike, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll first provide some comments on our fourth quarter and full year results before moving onto our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales in the fourth quarter were $509 million, a 14% increase from the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. This change in sales included organic volume growth of 13% and a 1% increase related to the first year affect of acquisitions. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, adhesive dispensing segment sales volume increased 3% as compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Our general product assembly, rigid packaging and non-woven product lines led the growth in the current quarter. Asia Pacific, Europe and the United States were the strongest regions. Sales volume in the advanced technology segment increased 32% from the prior year fourth quarter including a 30% increase in organic volume and a 2% increase related to the first year affect of the LinkTech acquisition. Organic growth was robust across the segments electronic systems and fluid management portfolios led by a demand for our automated and semi automated dispensing product lines. The growth was positive in nearly all geographies and was strongest in Asia Pacific and Japan. Organic sales volume in the industrial coatings segment increased 12% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Demand for our cold material dispensing in automotive and other durable goods end markets drove the growth. Growth was strongest in the Americas, the United States and Japan. Gross margin for the total company in the fourth quarter was 54%, a 1% improvement over the prior year driven primarily to favorable mix. As part of our previously discussed margin enhancement initiatives, we incurred onetime cost during the fourth quarter of approximately $6.4 million, mostly related to restructuring and severance as we worked through rationalizing our footprint within the adhesive segment. Restructuring cost associated with our margin enhancement initiatives are largely behind us at this point. We also incurred $211,000 of short-term purchase accounting charges in the quarter related to acquired inventory within the advanced technology segment. Operating profit in the quarter including these onetime charges was $111 million and operating margin was 22% or 23% on a normalized basis to exclude onetime charges. Reported operating margin in the quarter improved by five percentage points compared to the prior year through the combination of volume leverage, mix and the net effect of continuous improvement initiatives. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, adhesive dispensing delivered operating margin of 24% in the fourth quarter inclusive of approximately $5.6 million of restructuring charges. Normalized operating margin within the segment to exclude these onetime charges was 26%. Within the advanced technology segment, reported operating margin was 26% including the $211,000 short-term purchase accounting adjustments for acquired inventory and $373,000 of onetime restructuring charges. The industrial coating segment delivered operating margin of 23% in the fourth quarter including $468,000 of onetime restructuring charges. Net income for the quarter was $76 million, fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 56% compared to the prior year to $1.31 or $1.39 on a normalized basis to exclude onetime items. We have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain onetime items. The fourth quarter\u2019s EBITDA was $128 million and cash flow from operations was $136 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $121 million reflecting strong cash conversion of 160% of net income. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. Capital deployment during the quarter included acquiring LinkTech to add to our advanced technology segments medical offering, increasing our annual dividend for the 53rd consecutive year and reducing notes payable and debt by $59 million. I\u2019ll now provide a few comments on our full year results. Sales for fiscal 2016 were $1.8 billion, organic growth for the year was a robust 7% compared to the prior year, this is outstanding growth given the challenging macroeconomic environment of 2016. Full year gross margin was 55%. Full year operating profit was $388 million and reported operating margin was 22%. This operating margin is an improvement of three percentage points compared to the prior year, with full year incremental operating margin of 59%. Net income for the full year was $272 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.73, a 37% improvement over fiscal year 2015. Full year EBITDA was $459 million and free cash flow before dividends was $272 million or 100% of net income again reflecting strong cash conversion. In addition to funding organic and acquisitive growth initiatives during the year, Nordson invested $32 million to repurchase shares all during our first fiscal quarter, paid $56 million in dividends for a full year payout ratio of 21% and reduced leverage on the balance sheet from approximately 2.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA at the start of the year to approximately two times at the end of the year. I\u2019ll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12-weeks, ending December 4, 2016 order rates were up 17% as compared to the same 12-weeks in the prior year. Within the adhesive dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are up 8% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Orders were up in all product lines and were led by polymer processing and rigid packaging. Asia Pacific, Japan and the U.S. were strongest geographically. In the advanced technology segment, order rates for the latest 12-weeks are up 34% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Order rates were up in all product lines in all geographies most by double digits. Within the industrial coating segment, the latest 12-week orders are up 11% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Cold material dispensing equipment for automotive and industrial applications and powder coating equipment for consumer durable end markets drove this growth. The U.S., Europe and the Americas were strong geographically. Backlog at October 31, 2016 was approximately $274 million, an increase of 20% compared to the prior year with less than 1% of the increase due to the LinkTech acquisition. Backlog amounts were calculated at October 31, 2016 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We are forecasting sales to be in the range of up 4% to up 8% as compared to the first quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic volume of up 6% to up 10%, offset by negative 2% unfavorable currency translation effects based on the current exchange rate environment. Relative to current order rates, the sales outlook reflects expected moderation in order rates as we move through the quarter and some of the recent orders will benefit our second quarter. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect the first quarter gross margin to be above 55% and operating margin to be approximately 18%. We are estimating first quarter interest expense of about $5 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 29% resulting in first quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.74 to $0.84. In addition to this first quarter outlook, the following full year data points may be helpful for modeling purposes. For our effective tax rate, we are forecasting the full year rate to be about 29% based on current tax law. And finally, for capital spending in fiscal 2017 we are forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million. This capital-spending forecast does not include spending associated with our previously announced U.S. Polymer product line footprint consolidation where we will be exiting two loans and one leased facility and consolidating into one newly leased facility in Ohio. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Our strong fourth quarter capped an excellent year where we outperformed relevant industries and most of our industrial peers. We are clearly seeing the benefits of prior investments in growth and margin enhancement initiatives and we continue to focus on these in fiscal 2017. As our performance against our 200 basis point operating margin initiative, I believe we\u2019ve captured the majority of this in fiscal 2016, but we will continue to utilize the Nordson business system to further widen our operating margins. Our team deserves credit for serving our customers at the highest level and for continuing to optimize our business. Our first quarter outlook reflects our improved backlog, current 12-week order rates, typically seasonality and comparisons to prior year or organic growth was modest. We are very encouraged by our order rates we are seeing in all three segments particularly in the advanced technology segment where demand for our solutions is strong across electronic and medical end markets. Of course, our comps get more challenging as we move through the year and we remain cautious with regards to the overall macroeconomic environment. Longer term, we continue to feel good about the multiple opportunities we have to drive growth in all of our segments. Overall, our strategic priorities for the year remain pretty straightforward. We are focused on driving organic growth above global GDP. From an M&A perspective, we continue to target high quality companies in the spaces we have identified and we\u2019ll continue to use the tools within the Nordson business system to drive operating improvement across the enterprise. At this time, we\u2019ll be glad to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Your line is open. Patrick Wu : Hi guys, this is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charlie. Thanks for taking my question. Michael Hilton : Good morning, Patrick. Patrick Wu : Good morning. I just wanted to -- just to take a quick look at operating margin. I think excluding one-time items it was around 200 basis points above last year. Can you guys maybe parse out what the contribution is for mix, pricing volume, and even NBS? I just want to get a better sense of that. Michael Hilton : Patrick, you are talking for the year or just for the quarter? Patrick Wu : Just for the quarter. Michael Hilton : Well for the quarter, we are up about five full percentage points and if you look at that certainly, the volume leverage is a significant contributor. You know we do have better mix as associated with say more of the high-end dispensed products and particularly in the electronic systems business. And then you know I would say as it relates to our initiative to move our operating margins up a couple of 100 points, basis points structurally you know and now for the whole year I think we are probably well above 80% of the way there, so that obviously contributed. So if you look at it, it may be equal amounts across that mix of comments. Patrick Wu : Right. And to be fair I do see the five points, but I was just speaking strictly to excluding restructuring. I think\u2026 Michael Hilton : And it\u2019s about -- if we excluded onetime items in both years it\u2019s about a 400 basis point improvement. Patrick Wu : Okay. And another question I had was, and can you remind us whether or not there is any seasonality involved in terms of order intake and I know 17% or 70% [ph] and that\u2019s a great number, but I just looking back a couple of years, I don\u2019t think that is the case but I do want to see whether or not seasonality played an issue there, and if it did, how much of that was part of the seasonality? Michael Hilton : No, I would say no that is not a seasonality effect. I mean from order perspective seasonality typically would suggest that you know this time of the year we would be trending down with the holiday period coming I\u2019d say down relative to the other three -- to the rest of the year. So peak is typically in the tail end of the third into the fourth quarter and it trails down. We are seeing that same kind of seasonal pattern, but I would say just much more robust orders right now based on really the things that we have been talking about all year and that is around growth, it\u2019s the new product that we have introduced with some new applications and quite frankly its recapitalization based on technology improvement that is driving that, but there is not a I\u2019d say year-on-year seasonal change that we are seeing this year. Patrick Wu : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Warendorf with Wunderlich. Your line is open. Peter Warendorf : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Peter Warendorf : I just had a few quick questions on the segments. In the adhesive segment, how specifically was the polymer business in the fourth quarter and then in ATS segment, how did the Nordson Medical do? Michael Hilton : Okay, I\u2019d say in the fourth quarter, the polymer business was off a little bit, but it tends to be lumpy particularly with some of the larger projects that we do for the year. It was up but off a little bit in the fourth quarter, but as you saw from the commentary on order rates, really solid order rates in the first quarter there. And as it relates to the medical business, another strong year in medical business of solid and strong fourth quarter in the medical business, you know a function of continuing to add to the breadth of our product lines as well as globalizing some of the businesses that were primarily North America focus, so very strong growth in that segment across the year. Peter Warendorf : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks, good morning and congratulations on a great year. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Chris. Christopher Glynn : So you know even with the strong first quarter outlook, the revenue guide indicates a relatively slow backlog conversion multiples, so wondering if there is anything to understand there about backlog composition trends and bearing in mind that you have been beating on revenues for several quarters here now. Michael Hilton : Yes, I would say a couple of things. As it relates to the backlog, we do have projects that we know are not going to be delivered in the quarter. And you know sometimes our customers will place large orders with stage deliveries and we\u2019re seeing some of that, so we factor that in. As I was mentioning earlier, we do have this sort of seasonal period where we get through closer to the holidays things, slow down a fair bit from an order entry perspective and so we are factored in sort of our historical view on that. So I\u2019d say nothing unusual there, just fairly typical other I\u2019d say you know given the relatively strong systems orders for the year and solidly in the fourth quarter some of those we know are not going to be delivered in the first quarter. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And you know ATS has had pretty killer year, better mobile cycle, but also you are clearly expanding your markets there, so there is some new favorable dynamics I would think. So could you help us conceptualize how to think about the comparisons as the year goes on in terms of modeling? Michael Hilton : Yes, so the primary driver for the electronics part of ATS over the last number of years that we have talked about has been mobile, and that continues to be the biggest driver. But as we talked about in the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve sort of spread the customer base there to take advantage of the initial automation of the Chinese mobile customers. And we\u2019re seeing that on the dispense side and we are starting to see some traction on the inspection side, which is encouraging. And in addition we\u2019ve done some things through technology to create some opportunities for on wafer dispense and inspection and we\u2019re continuing to see traction there. So from our perspective, the diversification efforts are continuing to play out well here for us in the near term. We still potentially have the wavering effect from how much change year-over-year has gone into the mobile segment and at this point of time, it is really hard to access that. You know as we\u2019ve talked about in the past we do a lot of development work with end customers on this during the period of time but through I\u2019d say February or so and then really it\u2019s towards that second quarter that we\u2019re getting a real sense of how many of those are going to go forward. So I\u2019d say we are still in that development period, the development is fairly robust but we don\u2019t have a clear crystal ball on which projects are going to hit. Now outside of the electronics piece, as we talked about just a moment ago, medical is doing well, we continue to broaden and diversify that business including this last acquisition that broadens our quickens [ph] our product line. And in a general industry area, we are seeing an uptick in improvement in things like 2K products for construction, the acquisition of Liquidyn last year filled in a nice gap in our prior client where we are really seeing significant global growth with that business and some of the other new developments from a product standpoint. So the areas outside the electronic system we are trying to continue to diversify and see good traction. The electronics piece, we\u2019re diversifying but we still have the impact of the mobile piece and it\u2019s hard to say beyond the next quarter where we are at there. Christopher Glynn : Okay, that\u2019s a really helpful explanation on the mobile piece. I guess within mobile are adjacent to it, you know we\u2019ve seen the pattern in years past, but the Chinese piece is clearly gaining some scale I think, is that a more dramatic factor for you? Michael Hilton : That\u2019s certainly becoming more relevant as we start to see more adoption of automation and there sort of our tiered offering approach has really gotten some good traction. So, we do think that the key suppliers that are going to be around from a China perspective will continue to automate and we still there are opportunities there to sell critical equipment to allow them to do that. Christopher Glynn : Okay and maybe the same answer, my last one I promise. Any view to the sustainability and mix? Michael Hilton : You\u2019re talking about across the company or\u2026. Christopher Glynn : ATS, sticking with ATS here. Michael Hilton : Yes, well I\u2019d say in the long run we still think things like medical are going to grow faster than other elements of the business. We do think that we\u2019ll see growth in the electronic systems piece but it\u2019s going to come more from our efforts to broaden and diversify and less from smartphone, things like smartphone penetration. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, as we look at year-over-year this year and that particular segment having more of the dispense type business where we provide more of the value add had helped our margins. And so I would say that could continue to help if we see dispense continuing to be as high as it has been, but quite frankly we like our margins in the test inspection business and we are looking to drive that businesses well. So I\u2019d say there are opportunities for continued improvement in the mix, but again the mobile piece will determine if we have fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Gregory Thaxton : And Chris, I would just add that this is Greg. We do see continued good growth rates in medical and from an inorganic perspective; we\u2019d like to see that become a bigger mix of the portfolio as well to help with some of the cyclicality aspect of that segment. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks for the understanding guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hey guys, this is James Picariello on for Jeff. Michael Hilton : Good morning. James Picariello : Can you talk about in what businesses particularly you expect this moderation and orders during this seasonal low that you talked about. So, what business is there? And then also in terms of the backlog timing, you said that you expect some business to flow through in the second quarter, can you also just provide color around what segments are positioned to benefit there? Michael Hilton : Yes. So I would say, all of the businesses see this seasonal sort of slowdown from an order intake, just because of the holiday, I mean we think about our -- where we are right now. We\u2019re in the middle of December, a lot of our customers shutdown. I would say, it\u2019s probably more impactful on our coatings businesses and potentially some of the other businesses where we have bigger systems, order is because people tend to wrap up the year and then it\u2019s usually well in the January before they\u2019re through their budgeting for [ph] the next year, many of our customers are on the calendar basis for their capital improvement. So I\u2019d say, those are the areas that tend to slow down. And then I\u2019d say, on the businesses that has sort of bigger orders, we can have some of those in coatings, but it\u2019s more likely it will be in the electronics area where customers has staged orders at polymer area or we can have some bigger projects. And then within our adhesive area some of products assembly business which tend to be bigger systems order could also stretch out in time, because of the nature of the project. So it varies across. I would say, a lot of our core packaging kinds of activities at nonwovens is tend to be delivered in the quarter and some of our more standard products and the other businesses tend to be deliver in a quarter, and of course the other part side of the business is generally all the quarter. So it\u2019s basically the larger systems orders and those orders that are placed 50 at a time, 100 at a time with staged deliveries and those are the areas that I mentioned. James Picariello : Okay. And then, regarding restructuring, the benefits are clearly -- clearly have shown throughout this year. You did make the comment that restructuring actions are largely behind the company now in terms of the costs. Are there any additional actions that could be taken in FY 2017? And how you are thinking about emphasizing the savings bucket, incremental savings bucket for this upcoming year? Michael Hilton : Yes. I would say, the primary activity that we see going that\u2019s significant in the next year is really this consolidation in the U.S. of three polymer facilities into one and that will be going throughout the year. As far as sort of charges, I think we\u2019re largely beyond the charges. As far as the benefits, some of the benefits may stretch out into the first quarter of 2018 and as we build out and then transfer to that facility. But I don\u2019t see any substantial charges related to the programs that we\u2019ve talked about in the specifics sort of structural margin improvement. At that said, we have an ongoing robust program in our Nordson business system to drive year-on-year continuous improvements and we have strong plans in place there, kind of our minimum goal there is offset any cost portion and over and above that we\u2019re looking for some benefits. James Picariello : Okay. And just last one on capital allocation. The bias this year has been on debt repayment, so how does the M&A pipeline look and how are you balancing your debt repayment versus acquisitions and even buyback at this point, how you\u2019re thinking about those three? Michael Hilton : Yes. So I would say, as we typically thought about primary number one is to support organic growth and I think Greg talk a little bit that including the activities we have going on for restructuring. Second is our dividend piece, that\u2019s pretty modest. So then when you get back to that, M&A is a key priority. We still have the four areas that we\u2019re interested in along with anything that we could to tuck into our core business, the area that has probably the deepest pipeline is still in the medical area. We made one small acquisition this year. There is small acquisitions and some larger ones out there that would be opportunities. And I\u2019d say also in other areas where we continue to have interest is in the coal material space. I think then Greg talk little bit about how that\u2019s doing from an order and performance perspective. So, I\u2019d say, the pipeline is pretty robust. I\u2019d say the market is relatively full price kind of opportunities here and we\u2019ve got pretty clear views on what we\u2019re interested in and what we\u2019re willing to pay, but I would say, we\u2019ve got a pretty robust pipeline. I\u2019d say on the share buybacks, we still have an open share buyback authority from our board. As Greg mentioned, we haven\u2019t done anything since the first quarter and we\u2019ll continue to opportunistic there. James Picariello : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Hey, morning. Thanks. Mike, if we just taken into account kind of conversations you\u2019re having with your customers at this point, and you sort of touched on this a little bit, but what does that suggest you about the prospect for advanced technology to generate organic growth in the mid single-digit or better range again in 2017 relative to how you performed in 2016? And I guess, do you get the sense that you have the opportunity to break this sort of every other year kind of where you get high single to low double-digit organic growth that it flatten out. Can you just sort of talk about that in a little more granularity? Michael Hilton : Yes. What I would say, at a high level as Greg mentioned earlier, there is still some cyclicality to that business, and as long as it sort of going to driven, and I\u2019ll talk about half of the advanced tech piece that\u2019s focused on the electronic business. As long as that is kind to be linked strongly to the mobile piece you\u2019re going to have some of that, and quite frankly we\u2019ve taken advantage of all advances in the mobile segment, but it does provide some fluctuation. So, as we\u2019ve talked on that particular piece it comes down to how much change you\u2019re going to see year on years, for long time it was about penetration smartphone. We\u2019re pretty much there in terms of the overall market penetration, I think that with the perhaps with the exception of large market like China and maybe in the future growing market like India. But we\u2019re pretty close to being there from a penetration standpoint. So it comes down to change and that we\u2019ve talk in the past it not just sort of form factor change or feature change, it can also be process change like water proofing which drove some activities this year. So, I\u2019d say, all the projects that we\u2019re working on with our critical customers are around change elements. And it\u2019s hard for us to predict what they are going to launch on going forward. So that\u2019s still unknown. I think the things that can counterbalance that are couple of fold. One, new products can help from giving our customers greater value and benefit and potentially allowing us to increase our wallet share. Two, we have some new application, so we talked a lot about wafer side of things where we\u2019re going into that through dispense for three dimensional, 3D type shifts and as well as inspection for that. And then, the tiering piece is really being focus \u2013 as a focus for the company across all markets, but in particular in this end, we\u2019ve really seem traction as we mentioned last quarter with three of the four Chinese mobile guys and what we see from them is more interest in doing more automation, more interest in doing more sophisticated types of processing, so that certainly encouraging. Obviously, you have to pull the trigger on it and place the orders throughout the year, but that\u2019s encouraging. So those are the kind of things we\u2019re trying to do to counterbalance that sort of on/off cycle that we\u2019re seeing for the last years in the mobile side. What that balance in the end looks like is I\u2019d say it\u2019s still hard to tell right here. In the long run we do think we\u2019re going to grow above the market because of the things like new products, new applications tiering to give us growth more robust than what you\u2019ll see in the industry. In the short run its little harder to predict. Obviously, we\u2019re off to a good start here on that business, but the critical timeframe on the mobile phone piece is really as we get close to the end of the second quarter. And then when you look at the other part of the business, the fluid management part of the business, medical, it\u2019s all about new products and increasing the breath of our product offering. And then in the general industry area it\u2019s driving our offerings there. We\u2019ve done a complete head to toe refresh of all of our dispense products. We\u2019ve upgraded our tabletop automation products. We\u2019ve added things like Liquidyn and they\u2019re getting good traction and allowing us to globalize, and we\u2019ve introduced some really new technology that both the electronics organization and the fluid management organization using on these very high, small volume dispense applications that we\u2019re getting traction on. So those are all of things that we\u2019re trying to do to buffer it. I can\u2019t say that that\u2019s going to be -- we\u2019re not going to see some year on year up and down depending on how the mix works out there. Matt Summerville : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, within just thinking about advance tech, can you talk a little bit about what you saw from a mix standpoint on a sequential basis from Q3 to Q4? And then sort of works that into, as we think about how to model Q1, how would suggest we look at advanced tech in the sense that if you just can go back the last couple years, your operating margins in Q1 have varied from say, 7% to 20%. So there\u2019s a pretty big gap there. I guess how would you suggest to we consider modelling Q1 in that regard? Michael Hilton : Yes. I\u2019d say, the things that have created the volatility in Q1 have been number one volume. So, in some cases where volume has been soft, I think you know we\u2019ve got strong incremental margins in the business and in the very short term you know this is a business where we can move resources up, down pretty quickly. It\u2019s hard to offset. So volume is the number one piece. And then two, mix in the business as I mentioned earlier, more dispense is better only because we have more value add on dispense side than we do on the inspection -- on the inspection side. So those two things tend to drive more than anything else what we see in the quarter. And so, like I said, we\u2019re off to a good start with the order pace that we have and the backlog that we have right now. And the other question on the third to fourth quarter, are you specifically talking about margins or what you\u2026 Matt Summerville : Yes. I mean, I\u2019m just looking at a $10 million round number, sequential revenue decline in the $14 million, $15 million sequential operating profit decline. I\u2019m just trying to understand what some of the current pluses and minuses are on that from a mix standpoint if you will? Gregory Thaxton : Yes, Matt. This is Greg. That\u2019s going to largely be within that segment product line mix whereas Mike alluded to, we\u2019ve got different margin profile on different product lines than others and then there is going to be some volume leverage as well. Matt Summerville : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Trusz with Gabelli. Your line is open. Matthew Trusz : Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Matthew Trusz : So, you\u2019ve spoken to the trend of recapitalization driving growth. Can you speak to the extent to which this is concentrated in that sort of traditional ADS North America area versus a more board opportunity for you? Michael Hilton : Yes. I mean, certainly one the key areas for us is the core adhesive business where we have such a large installed base. But we\u2019ve seen that in our fluid management business as an example, with this whole new launch of new products and refresh and augmentation to our valve line and the addition of product portfolio we\u2019ve seen a very strong value proposition to encourage our customers to upgrade to the latest technology, so that\u2019s another area that where we see that. I think when you look at even parts of our electronics area, it\u2019s around the performance of new products and what they can do to meet the challenges of the customers are looking at. But I\u2019d say, it certainly been in those two areas that I\u2019ve highlighted. Gregory Thaxton : And Matt, it\u2019s a global opportunities for us as well in the adhesive segment as well is that recap opportunity not just in the U.S. but globally. Matthew Trusz : Great. Thank you. And then second from me, at a high level how do you think about the political dynamics that you might faced next year on this customer confidence changed at all over the last couple of months? And how you\u2019re thinking about the early possibility of repatriating some foreign cash or any changes to tax policy? Michael Hilton : Yes. So I would say, let me try and address a couple of those , from a for us from a repatriation of cash its\u2019 not a big issue either way, because we have very small cash balance and we don\u2019t really have anything of substance trapped outside the U.S. So for us that\u2019s not necessarily an issue. What I would say though is a couple of things that are being talked about would be helpful for our customers but from an investment standpoint, so certainly overall our corporate tax rate would help some of our customers in the U.S. and we have 70% of our business outside the U.S. so we are taking advantage of growth in all of those areas, but it would certainly help some of the U.S. customers. And I\u2019d say some of the areas around de-regulation would be helpful as well to customers in the U.S. and potentially increase their thoughts around investment. I do think there were some areas like our powder business this year where we saw customer\u2019s kind of delaying. They tend to be bigger system orders delaying investment to see how the election play is played out and we\u2019ve seen a near term uptick in that business, but I\u2019d say too early to tell, certainly anything that drives growth more is going to lead to more investment which is going to be a good thing for us. So if it increases our customers confidence and leads the investment that will be a plus and we are really everywhere with all the critical customers to take advantage of that. But it\u2019s pretty early out in the process. Matthew Trusz : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Jaye for closing remarks. Jim Jaye : Thank you Kelly and thanks everybody for joining us on the call today. I am available remainder of the week if you have any follow up questions and thank you again. Appreciate your interest. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director, Jim Jaye. You may begin. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Leanne. This is Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Communications for Nordson. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Pembroke, Corporate Vice President within our Advanced Technology segment . We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, February 21, 2017, to report Nordson's FY 2017 first quarter results and our FY 2017 second quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at Nordson.com /investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until February 28, 2017, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 64914948. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectation. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we'll provide some comments on our most recent acquisition, as well as on yesterday's announcement on our agreement to acquire Vention Medical's Advanced Technologies business. We'll then be happy to take your questions. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our global team delivered very solid performance this quarter. We generated organic growth of 10% compared to the prior year, with all three segments contributing to the growth. This marks the 11th time in the last 12 quarters that Nordson has delivered organic growth compared to the prior year. Diverse end markets, innovative products, new applications, and the best customer experience are continuing to drive our success. We leveraged the increased volume to drive significant improvement in operating margin and earnings per share compared to the first quarter a year ago. Our ongoing continuous improvement efforts are aiding our results as well. We also continue to generate strong levels of free cash, and we executed on our capital deployment strategy, where we distributed approximately $15 million in dividends and completed one acquisition during the first quarter. Two other acquisitions closed during the first few weeks of this quarter. And, as Jim noted, we are very happy to announce an agreement to acquire Vention Medical's Advanced Technology (sic) [Technologies] business. This transaction gives us real scale among many other benefits in one of their fastest growing and highest performing product line. We'll provide some additional detail on Vention and the other recent transactions later in the call. All four of these deals are aligned with our strategy and should provide excellent opportunities for profitable growth. Looking ahead to our second quarter, we're forecasting solid organic growth at the midpoint of our outlook. This outlook is based on current backlog, order rates, project activity, and in comparison to a very robust quarter of organic growth a year ago. I'll speak more about our outlook, current business trends and our recent acquisitions in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed commentary on our current results, and our second quarter guidance. Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Regarding first quarter results, sales were $407 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year's first quarter. This change in sales included a 10% increase in organic volume, a 1% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions, and a 1% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year's first quarter. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, organic sales volume increased 3% as compared to the prior year first quarter, offset by 1% negative impact related to currency translation. This is solid growth against a challenging comparison of the prior year first quarter, where organic growth was 11% in this segment. Our product assembly and rigid packaging product lines drove the growth in the current quarter. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific, the Americas and Japan were strongest. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 25% over the prior year first quarter, inclusive of a 23% increase in organic volume, and a 2% increase related to the first year effect of the LinkTech and ACE acquisitions. The growth was offset by 2% negative impact related to currency translation. All product lines and geographies in the segment delivered excellent organic growth, most by double digits, with performance aided in part by comparison to a softer first quarter in some end markets a year-ago. Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 8%, compared to the first quarter year-ago, offset by a 2% negative impact related to currency translation. Growth was strong in nearly all regions and was led by demand for our cold material dispensing, powder coating and UV curing product lines. Gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was 55%, a 2 percentage point improvement compared to the prior year first quarter, driven by volume leverage and favorable mix. Operating profit in the quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 19%, a 5 percentage point improvement over the first quarter a year ago. Incremental operating margin on the increased volume was 68%. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, reported operating margin was 26% in the first quarter, an improvement of 1 percentage point compared to the same period a year ago. Within the Advanced Technology segment, reported operating margin was 18% in the first quarter, an increase of 11 percentage points over the same period a year ago, and within the Industrial Coating segment, reported operating margin was 13% in the first quarter, an improvement of 5 percentage points over the same period a year ago. This strong performance overall given the seasonally lower first quarter volume that is typical for all three of our segments, volume leverage, favorable mix and continuous improvement initiatives enabled all three segments to deliver operating margin improvement. For the company, net income for the quarter was $50 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.86, 19% higher than last year's first quarter. We've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share. On a normalized basis, EPS in the current quarter represents a 41% increase over the prior year normalized EPS. First quarter's EBITDA was $94 million and cash flow from operations was $78 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $71 million, reflecting cash conversion of 143% of net income. We've included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends. In terms of capital allocation priorities, as Mike mentioned, we continued our balanced approach, distributing approximately $15 million in dividends to shareholders during the quarter, and we've been active on the acquisition front. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, down from 2 times at the end of fiscal 2016, and 2.8 times at the end of fiscal 2015. I'll now move onto comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of FY 2017. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the 12 weeks of the prior-year on a currency-neutral basis and with acquisitions that closed prior to the end of the first quarter of 2017, included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending February 12, 2017, order rates are up 7% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are down 1% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Positive order rates in packaging and product assembly were offset by softness in other product lines. Geographically, positive orders in the Americas were offset by flat to slightly down rates in other regions. Timing of larger dollar system orders can have an effect on order rates, and for most of this latest 12-week period, order rates in the Adhesive segment have been up mid-to-high single-digits over the same period a year ago. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 15% as compared to the prior year. These order rates reflect strong demand for automated and semi-automated dispensing systems, test and inspection systems and surface treatment systems for electronics end markets. Order rates were up in all geographies. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 14%, nearly all product lines and geographies were positive. Backlog at January 31, 2017 was approximately $308 million, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year and inclusive of 23% organic growth and 1% growth due to acquisitions. Backlog amounts are calculated at January 31, 2017 exchange rates, and include acquisitions that closed prior to the end of the first quarter of 2017. With this backdrop, we're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 3% to 7% as compared to the second quarter a year ago. The sales forecast does include acquisitions that have closed, but does not include the Vention AT acquisition which is not yet closed. This range is inclusive of an increase in organic volume growth of 3% to 7%, 2% growth from the first-year effective acquisitions and a negative currency impact of 2% based on current exchange rates. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect second quarter gross margin to be approximately 56% and operating margin to be approximately 24%. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $6 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 29%, resulting in second quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.33 per share. In addition to the second quarter outlook, the following full-year updates may be helpful for modeling purposes. For our effective tax rate, we're forecasting the full-year rate to be about 29% based on current tax law and excluding discrete items. For capital spending in 2017, we're forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Greg. Again, I want to thank our team for delivering another strong quarter, where sales and EPS were first quarter records for Nordson. Our second quarter outlook is also very positive and we're forecasting good organic growth, against a very strong period a year ago. We'd now like to spend some time highlighting the three recent acquisitions we have closed since the first of the year, and the agreement we have entered into, to purchase the Advanced Technology business of Vention Medical. A slide deck providing additional detail on these transactions is available on our investor website at nordson.com. We're excited about all of these additions to the portfolio and the profitable growth opportunities we believe they bring. All four will become part of our Advanced Technology segment, further balancing the business around less cyclical end markets. On January 3, we closed on the purchase of the ACE Production Technology (sic) [Technologies. ACE is the U.S.-based manufacturer of selective soldering systems, used in a variety of automotive and industrial electronics assembly applications. ACE technology is highly complementary to Nordson's existing conformal coating and optical inspection solution, and their products are often sold to the same set of customers. On February 16, we announced the purchase of Interselect, a European-based provider of the same-type of technology as ACE. Together these two properties will give us a new platform for growth within the electronics manufacturing space and further diversify our product offering. Combined annual revenue of the two businesses is approximately $12 million, with EBITDA margins in the mid-teen. We expect future performance of these businesses will benefit from volume leverage and operational improvements from the Nordson Business System. Regarding our other recent transaction announcements on Plas-Pak and the Advanced Technology business of Vention Medical, let me turn the call over to Jeff Pembroke, Corporate Vice President within Nordson's Advanced Technology segment. Jeffrey Alan Pembroke : Thank you, Mike. We're very pleased with the acquisition of Plas-Pak Industries, which we announced on February 1. Plas-Pak expands and diversifies Nordson's offering of single-use dispensing syringes, cartridges and related components. Plas-Pak's recurring revenue model, proprietary technology and low-dollar cost, high value-add selling proposition are complementary and consistent with our existing Nordson EFD product line. Plas-Pak strengthens Nordson EFD's position in select industrial end markets, while providing access to a rapidly growing animal health market and broader exposure to the DIY, pesticide and dental markets. The company has averaged high single-digit annual revenue growth over the last five years and had 2016 revenues of approximately $28 million and EBITDA margins slightly higher than Nordson's 2016 margin. We expect to leverage Nordson's global footprint to accelerate Plas-Pak's growth beyond its current strong presence in North America. And as announced in a press release yesterday, we've entered an agreement to acquire the Advanced Technologies business of Vention Medical, also known as Vention AT. This is a great acquisition for our customers, shareholders and employees. Vention AT is a premium quality highly complementary business that immediately adds significant scale and differentiation to our existing Nordson MEDICAL platform. It also establishes Nordson as a leading designer, developer and manufacturer of minimally invasive interventional delivery devices, balloons, catheters and advanced components for the global medical technology market. This transaction marks a major step forward in realizing our vision to become the premier solution provider of highly engineered, single-use components and delivery devices to leading medical device OEMs and emerging innovators around the world. Vention AT brings many complementary capabilities to our existing Nordson MEDICAL offering, such as complex extrusion, balloon and catheter manufacturing, nitinol forming and other specialty material expertise. They have one of the largest design and development teams in the industry, which provide full service solutions to customers from concept design and prototyping, quality and regulatory support to finish device assembly, supporting some of the most complex and innovative interventional and advanced surgical procedures performed in healthcare today. Vention AT also strengthens and expands our relationships with medical device OEM customers, where we will now be able to provide a broader array of solutions across a wider range of high-growth therapeutic areas, such as cardiovascular, electrophysiology, peripheral vascular, urology and neurovascular among others. Finally, the acquisition clearly aligns with the medical growth strategy we have previously articulated and follows the other successful acquisitions we have made since 2010 to build our current Nordson MEDICAL platform, including Value Plastics, Micromedics, LinkTech Quick Couplings and Avalon Catheters. We see Vention AT as an ideal complement to our current offering, which includes single-use fluid management components, biomaterial delivery devices and high-end cannula and tubing. We estimate the total addressable market for the combination of Nordson MEDICAL and Vention AT to be in excess of $4 billion and growing at a high single-digit low double-digit rate. We expect the Vention AT transaction to close by the end of our second quarter. We look forward to bringing our combined capabilities to the many leading medical device OEM customers we currently share and expanding our reach to new customers. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to address additional financial aspects of these acquisitions. Gregory A. Thaxton: Thank you, Jeff. As with the Plas-Pak acquisition, we expect Vention AT to enhance Nordson's top and bottom-line growth and be accretive to total company EBITDA margins. Vention AT sales for the 12 months ended January 31, 2017 were approximately $150 million with EBITDA of $48 million. $705 million purchase price represents an EBITDA multiple of 14.7 times, in line with similar multiples paid for other high quality properties in the medical space. Initial identified cost synergies are modest and in the range of approximately $5 million. Including these benefits, the purchase price represents a synergized EBITDA multiple of 13.3 times. Assuming a close on Vention AT during our second fiscal quarter, we expect $0.05 to $0.10 accretion to EPS in fiscal year 2017 from all four acquisitions, including estimated purchase accounting charges. Once we close and get further into our valuation work on purchase price allocation, we'll provide further updates on expected EPS accretion. The Vention AT deal will be funded with cash and debt. Our net debt to EBITDA is approximately 1.8 times at the end of the first quarter. Based on our guidance for the second quarter and including trailing 12 month EBITDA for these four acquisitions, our net debt to EBITDA is forecasted at approximately 3 times after close. As we have demonstrated historically, our consistent levels of cash flow allow us to delever quickly. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you, Jeff and Greg. I want to welcome all the employees of ACE, Interselect and Plas-Pak and upon close Vention Medical AT to Nordson. We look forward to growing these great businesses in the months and years ahead. From an overall perspective, Nordson is firing on all cylinders right now. Thanks to the hard work of our team and the value we bring to our customers. We are executing on our growth strategy and the various initiatives we have to drive continuous improvement across the company. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Jeff. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, congratulation on this deal. Just can you walk through where you see the synergies, the $5 million and then just talk about where there is kind of the greatest customer overlap? And I think you mentioned kind of international opportunities. Just kind of touch on all those synergies. Thanks. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I'll just make a couple of comments. The synergy level is relatively modest as this is sort of a fourth pillar to our platform from a medical device standpoint. Obviously there will be some we'd see from the leverage of our procurement capability and then maybe some other cost improvement opportunities. We haven't included any revenue synergies here, although we do think and we have shown in the past that we've been able to demonstrate incremental top-line revenue by cross-selling across our product lines with the relationships that we have with key OEMs. As far as the specifics on the customer side, this is a relatively concentrated group of OEM customers, and what this does for us is give us access to essentially all of the large OEM customers. But at the same time, this business has done a nice job with \u2013 through the emerging innovators and it gives us access to the broader part of our product line to some of these emerging innovators. So, that's an interesting opportunity. And then as you said, a lot of the big customers are global and can help translate this business more globally, so we feel pretty good about the position of the business. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up here on Advanced Tech, can you just give us an update on what you're seeing from a quoting activity, customer tone standpoint as you kind of enter this more seasonally strong, maybe just comment on what you're seeing from the Chinese OEMs automation wise, anything around major smartphone upgrades, that'd be helpful. Thanks. Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I would say, let's sort of split this up into a couple of buckets. On the electronics side of the business, we're clearly seeing our approach to diversification playing out here. So, yeah, we're seeing good interest from the local mobile guys in China, but we also have more applications that go to in the automobile, electronics space and some of these new additions that we've added give us an even bigger footprint there on that automotive electronics space. But we're also seeing good penetration because of our new products into that wafer related processing, both the deposition through ASYMTEK and the inspection part of the business as well. So kind of what the story we've seen over the last few quarters is continuing there. We do see a lot of interest at least in terms of project activity on the mobile side. Again, at this point in time, you never know which ones of those are really going to come forward. And then if you look at the other part of the business, in our fluid management business, we're seeing solid business in a lot of general industry applications, fluid formulators, as well as activity in the electronics-related space. And then on medical, we're seeing strong opportunities in our medical business, related to our new products and our broadening product line there. So pretty solid activity across the board. Now also, we're up against that point of time where we start to see the business pickup, orders pickup, so we do have as the year goes on, for comps in the business as well. Jeffrey Hammond : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open. Liam D. Burke: Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Liam. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Liam. Liam D. Burke: Mike, could we go over to the adhesives and could you give us some color on how the polymer business has been doing? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So on the adhesives side of the business, the parts of the business that supports sort of consumer-related products, food and beverage other consumer related products, like packaging are doing well, our product assembly business is strong. Nonwoven business is a little soft, but that's against a really strong comparison last year. As you look at our polymer area, our dies business has picked up as the extrusion business has started to improve. We are seeing a little softness in the injection molding area, as we see some of the things like the auto business maybe start to slow down from a growth perspective a little bit. But in our melt delivery and our pelletizing business we expect to see this be a solid year, although, maybe a little lumpy, because particularly the pelletizing piece tends to be very project-specific. So, I'd say the business is improving, not quite as robust as we'd like to see, but improving. Liam D. Burke: Okay. Thank you. And on the Vention acquisition, you mentioned there was discussion of the customer overlap or non-overlap. Is there any leveragability on the R&D front or on the production front? Michael F. Hilton: I'd say on the production front, down the road there could be. On the R&D side, I think it's complementary capability, but at this point we haven't factor that in. Jeff, I don't know if you want to comment anymore on that. Jeffrey Alan Pembroke : Yeah. I would just say on the manufacturing front, one of the things that this acquisition brings us is a new position into complex extrusion, balloon blowing and manufacturing and nitinol forming some other things. So, it's really complementary to what we do today, with some very specialized facilities that they have. So, probably not so much on the manufacturing side. On the design and front end, there are certain aspects of how we design products across the different medical product platforms that we can take advantage of envelope technology from one area and use it in other, so we do think there's some opportunity there. Liam D. Burke: Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is open. Charles Brady : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Charley. Charles Brady : On this acquisition of Vention, you guys have talked about getting life sciences platform to $300 million, $400 million size, this certainly jumps at really closely to the bottom-end of that market. I'm just wondering it is guys obviously another piece of the business you really weren't into minimally invasive technologies. As you add this pieces of business, are there additional tack-on pieces to the one you just did that further broadens up the capabilities or as we look to life science M&A, this kind of it for a while you're going to focus on other areas in terms of M&A? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So let me make a couple of comments, Charley. So, first of all, we feel like we're getting a lot of capability with this particular acquisition and particularly, as you mentioned in the minimally invasive space, which is probably the highest growth space within the medical device marketplace ,so we like that. That said, across all of our businesses in the medical space, there's still a degree of fragmentation there, there's still a fair bit of work that's done in-house from the OEMs, that trend continues to outsource that. So, we see good organic growth opportunities and we do see opportunities to add additional capability down the road. But obviously, this is a sizable scale play for us and puts us well on the way to getting this business to something that down the road could be a $0.5 billion business for us. Charles Brady : Right. But I just want to go back, in your prepared remarks, on the orders for Adhesive Dispensing, I wasn't sure if I heard correctly. You talked about I think the tenure of orders through the quarter or through the 12 weeks, they had obviously ended up at 12 weeks down 1%, but I thought I heard you say that for the majority of the time they were actually up. Could you just clarify that? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. When you do the sort of point-to-point analysis, you can have a real strong week drop-off, and that's basically what we're seeing. And we think there's some timing around the year-on-year comparisons well, so we had solid orders and sort of in the last week, we had a period of time, where we had some very large orders last year that dropped out of that comparison. So, we feel pretty good about what we see, as I said across the businesses in terms of interest, particularly in the consumer non-durable related space, it was our packaging. As I said, this year the nonwovens area is going to be a little bit of a challenge, because we have such a strong year, last year with a lot of recapitalization, but we feel pretty good about the opportunities and prospects. That said, it's still an uncertain global kind of environment here. And so we feel pretty good about the opportunities that we see. Gregory A. Thaxton: And, Charley, just to put a little more color on that, it also highlights, in that segment, we've got some larger dollar product lines, so as those orders come in in one given week, if that happens to be a week that drops-off for an incoming week, it could impact that total 12-week view. But again, the comment was to suggest, if you look on a week-by-week basis within that 12 weeks, order rates were pretty robust. Charles Brady : Yeah. Okay. That's the point I was actually trying to just clarify. So, that is very helpful. And just one more for me, did you guys give a gross margin forecast for the second quarter? Gregory A. Thaxton: Yeah. We did. An operating margin? Michael F. Hilton: Gross margin. Gregory A. Thaxton: Gross margin, we suggest it would be 56% in the quarter. Charles Brady : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Matt J. Summerville: Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk about... Michael F. Hilton: Hi, Matt. Matt J. Summerville: ...Vention again for a moment. Can you talk about, you mentioned the $4 billion sort of TAM for your core Nordson MEDICAL, if you will, and then the recent acquisitions sort of combined, including Vention, how big is Vention's addressable market as a subset of that? And can you speak directly to the competitive environment, who the players are, what the relative market share position looks like? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So, I'll let Jeff probably add some color to that. But getting into the minimally invasive space dramatically increases the available market to us. So, probably two-thirds of that $4 billion really falls into that minimally invasive space. At a high level, there are a couple of key competitors. There is a company called Integer that's a competitor in this space. And then TE's Creganna business is a competitor in this space. We feel good about our full capability from a solutions provider standpoint. There is a bunch of smaller folks out there, so opportunities for the future. And then, there's a still a fair bit of work that's done in-house by large OEMs, but the trend continues to be to outsource that and focus more on the end device. Jeff, I don't know whether you want to add any additional color there? Jeffrey Alan Pembroke : Yeah. So, Mike, I think you had it right from that addressable market that we quantified about two-thirds of that would be in the Vention area, really related to minimally invasive interventional delivery devices and those sorts of things. The total outsource market for medical device OEMs is in excess of $40 billion. So, we're only talking about a portion of that, which is really the highly engineered differentiated piece. And, as Mike mentioned earlier in the call, there is additional opportunity that the OEMs continue to do in-house that more and more increasingly is being outsourced. And from a competitor standpoint, Mike mentioned, a couple, that we would see a directly against Vention AT. The market remains fairly fragmented as well with several other competitors out there as well. Matt J. Summerville: And then just a couple of follow-ups on just sticking with Vention. It looks like about a month ago, Vention completed an acquisition of a nitinol wire manufacturer. Can you speak to the significance of that acquisition, what that technology adds to Vention? And, then, whether these products or even, Mike, maybe in core Nordson MEDICAL to the extent anything that's being done here falls under some sort of Federal regulatory umbrella? Thank you. Jeffrey Alan Pembroke : Yeah. Mike, you want me to take that? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. Go ahead. Jeffrey Alan Pembroke : Yeah. So, what you'll find in these types of businesses that are technology based, a lot of the differentiation comes from your ability to manufacture, convert, and design around very specialty materials. And so, the addition of nitinol to Vention's capabilities, nickel, titanium, which is basically a very biocompatible material with shape memory, so it can be used transcatheter. You can shape it, get it through a catheter, arrive at a point and it goes back to its original shape to perform the function that it was meant to perform. So it's a material that is becoming more widely used in medical devices. And so the acquisition that Vention made was a company that has unique ability in forming nitinol into very complex shapes. So we do see that as a significant capability that we could take and expand to other applications and other customers. As it relates to the regulatory and FDA, so Vention would be subject to similar levels of regulatory risk and FDA burden that we experience in some of our current Nordson MEDICAL business today. Vention's liability is limited to the extent, they do not own 510(k) or device registrations. But they're subject to standard medical device quality standards and manufacturing practices, which are audited from time to time by the FDA. However this is common, and something that again we experience today within parts of our Nordson MEDICAL business. Matt J. Summerville: Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Josh L. Zaret: Hi guys, this is actually Josh, in for Chris. Thanks for taking my call and congrats on the quarter and the recent flurry of M&A. I guess the first one we have is \u2013 so Vention looks like a huge win at a really accretive price. So I guess are there any other medical deals out there that have a similar scale to Vention and such accretive margins or is this sort of a unicorn? Michael F. Hilton: Well, I would say, in terms of the margin side, our focus is really on differentiated capability and so everything that we're looking to acquire in this space, whether it's the minimally invasive space that we're talking about here or the other products that we've already acquired, it's around being able to differentiate capabilities, so that you can provide the right solution for customers, create value and get paid for it. So there are other opportunities out there that we continue to look at across all of the product lines within our medical business. I think this is a nice move from a scale perspective. There may be some others out there \u2013 there's certainly things that we're interested in, but really not in a point to talk about anything right now. So I'd say there's more opportunity, this is a good move from us from a scale point, but more importantly from the capability that it gives us the market segment that it opens up to us in a big way and the ability to kind of reinforce the broader capability we have with a consistent group of customers. Josh L. Zaret: Okay, perfect. And I guess the follow up over into ADS, it seems like things has slowed a bit in EMEA. Any color you could provide there or is this just a one-off or you've seen anything slowing ex-packaging there? Michael F. Hilton: As I said, I think, in this particular quarter as you look at the order rates, it's more probably larger project related kind of thing than anything else. What I would say is across the board, the sort of consumer non-durable space looks solid right now and that's why packaging looks solid. There's some good opportunities in the product assembly area that looks solid. Nonwovens is operating at a high level, but it's got a really tough comp last year, we did get a number of significant recapitalization. So, it's got a tough comp there. I'd say our dies businesses are improving. We're starting to see our core components pick up as well as the melt delivery in terms of opportunities out there, palletizing is lumpy, but we think it will be a good year but it's going to lumpy. So I'd say the big project mix is the one thing that's hard to predict and that's the one area that can move things around, that's both in say product assembly and some of the lesser extent nonwovens I mean and some things like palletizing. So, we think the opportunities are good, we've got tough comparables in that business. Josh L. Zaret: All right. Perfect. Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Yeah, Hi guys. Good morning. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning, Allison. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: With the incremental additions including Vention, how should we think about the seasonality with that ATS business, I imagine it's a bit more smooth than it's been historically going forward? Michael F. Hilton: I'd say on the seasonality, yeah, probably a little bit. But if you think about it, we're still going to see the kind of holiday effects that we see in most of our businesses in the first quarter. So, I'd say seasonality wise, there's probably a little improvement. Obviously from a cyclicality standpoint it's part of a specific strategy that we have to try and balance out that segment where we have more cyclicality in the electronics related parts of the business. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Great. And then on ETFs, I guess just in this optimism of the Trump administration right now, I know you've talked about backlog and orders, but in terms of inquiries have you seen sort of a mix towards these larger projects starting to come through, particularly if you look to the U.S. there are no change there yet. Just any thoughts on that? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. I would say we've not seen any dramatic change associated with the proposed policies that the President has talked about, but for some bigger projects it would take a little longer for those to materialize anyway. I mean, I think when you look at something for example like the auto industry we kind of supported wherever it is. So, they move from place to place, but we generally view that as an opportunity and one of the stronger sort of end markets. But we haven't really seen anything that we could identify as an uptick associated with the proposed policies. Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Scott Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gregory A. Thaxton: Good morning, Walt. Michael F. Hilton: Good morning. Walter Scott Liptak : I want to ask you about the Vention Medical acquisition, and I wonder if you can help us understand a little bit more about how the business was organized and the part of the business that you didn't acquire, and I guess it was for sale, so why didn't you acquire? Are there any relationships that are going to be continuing from that either way as a supply relationship et cetera? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So, I'll just make a couple of high level comments. I mean the overall Vention business was put together through a series of acquisitions, some more focused on, I'd say the service side of the business and some more focused on through the technology side of the business. And the owners in the process decided to split this up into sort of two pieces and as we said, before, we like the position, where you have the opportunity to be a solutions provider to the customer, where you've got differentiated capability and we certainly saw that in the Vention AT business, and that's why we were most interested in that particular business. There will be modest ongoing relationship between the two businesses and contracts to cover that, but it's not significant in terms of the total. So, they operated as fairly independent businesses. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. Great. And, so the manufacturing locate, they're not going to be contract manufacturing for Vention AT? Michael F. Hilton: No, there's some products that go back and forth, it's a very de minimis amount and we'll have agreements in place to address those, but it's not significant. There are \u2013 as Jeff had mentioned, there's certain capabilities with each of these sites that are important, and quite frankly the locations are important from medical device, particularly front-end design standpoint. So, we really like the locations that we have and the presence we have in sort of the hot bed (44:55) markets of the medical design space. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. Great. And then switching gears back to adhesives. I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about the polymers business, you mentioned that it was little bit soft for injection molding, were those comments specifically to automotive or is it, because that's kind of across the board, sort of a product or what are you thinking about for the full year in capital spending in that plastics area? Michael F. Hilton: Yeah. So I would say, we're encouraged by the activity that we see in terms of the opportunities. I'd say, we're finally starting to see some of the extrusion in the film part of the business pickup and that shows up most in our dies business, which is looking better. I'd say the injection molding part of the business has been on a strong run, up to about six months to nine months ago, where it's slowed down a little bit and I'd say that part is continuing. So I'd say we expect to see it to be a positive year from a growth perspective, but a lot of these are bigger projects, we're working on them now, they need to come through to have an impact in the year. But I'd say we're encouraged by what we're seeing from an opportunity standpoint, but it's not everything working in concert much like the core Adhesives business, where we've got a couple parts of the business looking pretty attractive and other parts up against tougher comps, and not quite as attractive right now. But again, anything that's really more consumer nondurable related is looking pretty strong and the durable piece is I'd say at a good level, but not strong as we might have seen in parts of last year. Walter Scott Liptak : Okay. Great. All right. Thank you. Operator : And I'm not showing any further questions. At this time, I'd now like to turn the call back to Senior Director, Jim Jaye for any further remarks. James R. Jaye: Thank you, Leanne and on behalf of our team, I appreciate you joining our call today. I'm available throughout the week to take any additional questions you might have. Thank you again, and have a good day and we'll signoff. Thank you. Michael F. Hilton: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. James Jaye : Thank you, Karen. I\u2019m here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, May 23, 2017, to report Nordson\u2019s FY 2017 second quarter results and our FY 2017 third quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at Nordson.com /investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until May 30, 2017, which can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 16097170. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectation. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. It was another very strong quarter for Nordson, included what was a record first-half sales and earnings per share performance for the company. Including the effects of the Vention acquisition closed during the quarter, not included in our quarterly guidance. We exceeded the high-end of our second quarter revenue expectations and operating margins improved by 1 percentage point compared to the prior year. These results speak to the strong underlying performance we\u2019re seeing across the business and our focus is to continue to improve. Overall, we generated 9% organic sales growth, which is in comparison to a very robust period growth a year ago. All segments and geographies contributed to the current quarter organically. Acquisitions added another 6% growth to top line. We\u2019re very pleased with how all of our new businesses are performing so far. Total revenue was a record [Technical Difficulties]. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter was impacted by one-time charges largely related to Vention acquisition. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 13% compared to the second quarter a year ago. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, EBITDA free cash flow before dividends increased by 13% compared to the same period last year, inclusive of transaction costs of the acquisition. Our base business is strong, our acquisitions are adding to our profitable growth opportunity, and our global team is executing across the enterprise. Looking ahead, we\u2019re forecasting continued strength for record third quarter performance. At the midpoint of our guidance, we\u2019re forecasting 8% organic growth, inclusive organic growth in all segments. This outlook is based on our current backlog, order rates, project activity, all of which are strong. I\u2019ll speak more about our outlook in a few minutes. But I\u2019ll first turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our third quarter guidance. Gregory Thaxton : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Second quarter sales were $496 million, an increase of 13% from the prior year\u2019s second quarter. This change in sales included a 9% increase in organic volume, a 6% increase related to the first year effect of acquisition, and a 2% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. The organic growth exceeded the high-end of our guidance driven by the strength we\u2019re seeing across our base business. Organic sales volume in the Adhesive Dispensing segment increased 5%, as compared to the prior year second quarter. This is very solid growth and compares to a robust period a year ago, where organic growth was 9% for the quarter. Our product assembly, packaging and polymer product lines drove the growth in the current quarter. Asia Pacific and the Americas were strongest on a geographic basis. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 34% from the prior year second quarter, inclusive of 18% organic volume growth and 16% growth related to the first year effect of acquisition. These segments\u2019 growth is very impressive, given the challenging comparisons from the prior year, where organic volume growth was 20% for the quarter. Nearly all product lines and geographies in that segment contributed to the current quarter organic growth, with most up by double-digit. Segments acquisitive growth includes the first year effect of the LinkTech, ACE, Interselect, Plas-Pak and Vention acquisition. Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 3% compared to the second quarter a year ago. Container coating and liquid painting product lines drove the growth with the U.S., Japan, and Asia Pacific being the strongest geography. Gross margin for the total company in the second quarter was 56%, down slightly from the prior year second quarter, due to the impact of acquisition and inclusive of $2.1 million of one-time charges to step up of the acquired inventory. Operating profit in the quarter was $104 million and reported operating margin was 21%. Including the effect of the Vention acquisition, which was not in our quarterly guidance, operating margin was 24% in the quarter, 1 percentage point higher than the prior year second quarter. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, reported operating margin was 29% in the second quarter. Within the Advanced Technologies segment, reported operating margin was 26% in the second quarter, an increase of 2 percentage points over the same period a year ago. Operating margin was 27%, when excluding the short-term purchase accounting charges for the step up in the value of acquired inventory. And within the Industrial Coating segment, reported operating margin was 17% in the quarter. This continued strong operating margin performance by all three segments and reflects our ongoing continuous improvement efforts. For the company, net income for the quarter was $65 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.11. Adjusted EPS in the current quarter was $1.35, a 13% increase over the prior year adjusted diluted earnings per share. We have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share. The second quarter\u2019s EBITDA was $123 million, cash flow from operations was $61 million, and free cash flow before dividends was $45 million. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, EBITDA increased 13% compared to the prior year to $217 million, and free cash flow before dividends increased 13% to $116 million, representing strong cash conversion of 101% of net income. Adjusted EBITDA on a fiscal year-to-date basis increased 20% and adjusted free cash flow before dividends increased 23% compared to the prior year, with both measures highlighting the strong cash generation of the overall business. We\u2019ve included tables with our press release reconciling net income to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow before dividends, and adjusted free cash flow before dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the second quarter is three times, including trailing 12 months of acquired EBITDA. This level is well below our most restricted debt covenants leaving us with additional debt capacity. And at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $360 million of combined cash and availability on a revolver. As we demonstrated, our strong cash generation enables us to delever quickly, which is our intent in the near-term. I\u2019ll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks, as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency-neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending May 14, 2017, order rates are up 13%, as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are up 1% compared to the same period a year ago, where comparisons are challenging as order rates were up 7% at this time last year. Positive order rates in packaging and product assembly were offset by softness in other product lines. Geographically, orders were up in all regions except Europe. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 30%, as compared to the prior year. Nearly all product lines and geographies were up by double digits. These order rates reflect strong demand for automated and semi-automated dispensing systems and surface treatment systems related to mobile device and other electronics end markets and fluid management components for industrial and medical markets. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 4%, with organic growth in most all product lines. Geographically, order strength in the U.S. and the Americas was offset by softness in other regions. Backlog at April 30, 2017 was approximately $403 million, an increase of 37% compared to the prior year, and inclusive of 18% organic growth and 19% growth due to acquisition. Backlog amounts are calculated at April 30, 2017 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We\u2019re forecasting sales to increase in the range of 15% to 19%, as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This growth includes organic volume growth of 6% to 10%, 10% growth from the first year effect of acquisitions and a negative currency effect of 1% based on the current exchange rate environment. At the midpoint of this outlook, we expect third quarter gross margin to be approximately 55% and operating margin to be approximately 24%, or 25% excluding estimated acquired inventory step-up charges and non-recurring restructuring charges associated primarily with our previously announced footprint consolidation initiative within our Adhesive Dispensing segment. We\u2019re estimating third quarter interest expense of about $9 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 29%, resulting in third quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.51 to $1.65 per share inclusive of approximately $0.07 per share, or $6 million, or intangible asset amortization charges related to our fiscal 2017 acquisitions, with most of this related to the Vention acquisition. A range of GAAP diluted earnings per share also includes one-time charges of approximately $0.03 per share for the footprint consolidation efforts within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, $0.02 per share for short-term purchase accounting related to the step-up in the value of acquired inventory, and a corporate charge of $0.01 per share for Vention acquisition transaction costs. Third quarter EBITDA is expected to be approximately $164 million, an improvement of approximately 18% over the same period a year ago. With regards to the Vention acquisition, we expect both short-term inventory step-up charges and transaction costs to be mostly complete in our third quarter. And for fiscal year 2017, we\u2019re forecasting Vention to deliver between $0.05 to $0.10 earnings per share, excluding transaction costs. From a performance perspective, Vention will be accretive to Nordson\u2019s EBITDA margin beginning in the third quarter. From an operating margin perspective, we do not expect Vention to have a material impact on Nordson\u2019s overall operating margins once we are past third quarter one-time charges. For Nordson overall, we\u2019re forecasting a full-year effective tax rate of 29% based on current tax law and excluding discrete items. For capital spending in 2017, we\u2019re forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Greg. I want to thank our team for delivering another outstanding quarter, revenue and earnings per share through the first-half were Nordson record. Innovation, premier customer service, strategic acquisitions, and continuous improvement using Nordson business system are driving our performance. And although, global growth is still expected to be \u2013 represent a challenging backdrop, we\u2019re forecasting another strong quarter. With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rudy Hokanson with Barrington Research. Rudy Hokanson : Thank you. Could you maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the medical end market since that\u2019s such a critical area, given your acquisitions right now? Is it \u2013 does it seem to be an organic type of steady growth, or is there a particular push geographically? I\u2019m just wondering if you could flush it out a little bit more, and if that \u2013 if there\u2019s anything else you can say in terms of getting to that level you\u2019ve talked about of maybe $500 million in revenue? Michael Hilton : So, obviously, we just closed on a pretty large acquisition for us with the Vention acquisition, which doubles the size of our business in the medical space. But if you look at the underlying demographics, we\u2019re seeing more procedures. We\u2019re seeing the move to plastic. We\u2019re seeing more outsourcing, all of that is driving significant sort of a top line growth. But the key to this like many of our businesses is around new products and innovation. And so in all of our businesses, we continue to introduce new products. And so across the Board, that is helping. In some of our businesses that we\u2019re relatively local or North American focused. We\u2019ve been able to globalize those, for example, in our Value Plastics business, we\u2019re seeing nice growth \u2013 global growth there. And we\u2019ve been successful with our OEM customers in some strong new product wins. So I\u2019d say, the things that we felt we\u2019re going to drive this business are exactly what we\u2019re seeing driving the business. Rudy Hokanson : Okay. Thank you. That was my primary question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Gregory Thaxton : Good morning, Liam. Liam Burke : Mike, could you give us a little color on the polymer business? You mentioned in the prepared statements that the business delivered results. Are you through the restructuring, and are you seeing good order flow here? Michael Hilton : So I\u2019d say, within the quarter, we had nice sales growth across all the product lines. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re starting to see the film business come back. Some of the businesses are a little bit more digital like our pelletizing business tend to be big project related, that was solid within the quarter. So I\u2019d say, across the board, we\u2019re seeing an improvement there. As far as the restructuring, no, we\u2019re not done. We\u2019re in the process in the U.S. of consolidation in our core components business. We have our new facility in Austin town, Ohio, where we\u2019re just bringing in equipment, as we speak. That should be fully up and running in transition probably by the first calendar quarter of next year, where we\u2019re starting to bring in equipment and we\u2019ll be doing that in stages. And then we\u2019re also expanding our facility in Germany, as a \u2013 our existing facility as a consolidation moves and that\u2019s probably another year out. So there\u2019s still work to be done there, but we\u2019re making good progress along the lines that we expected. Liam Burke : Great. And Vention has now been integrated. You have fair amount of liquidity, or you see acquisition pipeline continue to be strong, or how do you view that now? Michael Hilton : Yes. So, we\u2019ve had the Vention business for about a month. So I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s fully integrated, but I\u2019d say, the teams at Vention and Nordson MEDICAL are doing an excellent job focused particularly on our customers and making sure that we maximize our opportunities there. So we\u2019re off to a good start. I would say, there\u2019s still opportunities and probably the most robust area of opportunities are in the medical space. And I\u2019d say, also where you have this continued interest in the cold materials space. But I\u2019d say, the \u2013 probably the most robust area is probably in that medical space, because the market across the different products is fairly fragmented. So we\u2019re in a good spot. Obviously, as Greg said, our primary focus right now is to reduce our debt level. So that we\u2019re prepared for further opportunities in the future. Liam Burke : Great. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael Hilton : Good morning, Matt. Matt Summerville : In terms of incoming order rates, it looks like Europe was down kind of in the low single-digit range in the quarter. Can you maybe comment on what drove that and maybe you can give some part comments across your three reportable business segments? Michael Hilton : Yes, if you look at the order rates in Europe, I\u2019d say, really it\u2019s more a function of some tough comps. So if I look at, for example, our core Adhesives business, our packaging and product assembly is doing well. Our nonwovens is off a little bit, but that\u2019s a function of some large projects last year, as some of our customers were converting to new form factors, for example, in diapers. So I think, it\u2019s really just a tough comp, underlying business is solid, and there\u2019s a lot of sort of OEMs located in Europe. And I\u2019d say, ICS also a little softer, given the \u2013 some larger auto orders last year, which again are more digital. So I\u2019d say, there\u2019s nothing fundamentally going on there other than a little tougher comparisons there. Matt Summerville : And then, is there a way to parse, Mike, the growth you\u2019re seeing in the advanced tech business specifically on the electronics side between new platforms or new mobile devices being launched versus new processes, such as, moisture protection from medically sealing device et cetera, how much of the growth has been driven by those various buckets, if you will, new stuff being launched on the part of your customers versus new processes? Thank you. Michael Hilton : Yes. What I would say is, first is a general comment on the electronic side. This year, we\u2019re seeing pretty good backdrop across sort of all areas. So mobile is certainly strong, but auto electronics is strong. We\u2019re seeing a rebound in the semiconductor side. So all of those things are contributing number one. Then if you look specifically at the mobile side of things, you get sort of the entrenched global competitors who launched new products \u2013 who are launching new products this year. But also as we\u2019ve talked about the growth \u2013 significant growth of the sort of Chinese mobile suppliers that we\u2019re doing very well with as well. And a lot of that is the function of our sort of tiered offering structure to support them. And then, I\u2019d say, on the higher-end, it\u2019s really the new products that we\u2019ve offered not only on dispense, but in test and inspection and in select areas of service treatment allow our customers ultimately to lower their cost of ownership by getting more yield out to the back-end, so higher speed more precise spend, better resolution, faster processing of the inspection. There are some products that are related to things like water proofing, but I would say, that\u2019s probably not the primary driver here. I\u2019d say, our new products are getting us traction, whether that\u2019s the high-end, or whether it\u2019s the tiered products with the customer base there and we\u2019re taking advantage of all of the global growth we\u2019re seeing this year, but it\u2019s broader than just the mobile side. Matt Summerville : Then just lastly, if you back out the acquisitions in ACS, what would your core incremental margins have been in the quarter Greg? Gregory Thaxton : If you back out all current year acquisitions? Matt Summerville : Yes. Michael Hilton : That maybe something we have to get back to you on. We might not have that at, but it will be good, but we\u2019d have to buy that to get back to you. Gregory Thaxton : Obviously, very strong. If we look at those 200 to 300 basis points with some of the current year acquisitions and it\u2019d be even north of that. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. Michael Hilton : Good morning, Jeff. Gregory Thaxton : Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, so just back on electronics, can you just talk about the coating funnel activity levels just as you start to enter this period of tougher comps in advanced tech? Michael Hilton : Well, I\u2019d say, as you saw from our order rates going into the third quarter, they remain strong. This business is very seasonal though. So if you think about it, the development period tends to be our first quarter early into the second quarter. And the strong order period tends to be second quarter through third quarter maybe into the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re in that peak period of time, where we typically see the orders come in and project activity is high. It tends to taper off in the fourth quarter, because everybody is getting ready for various model launches, et cetera, holiday season, et cetera. So I\u2019d say, we\u2019re in that typical relative [ph] period and project activity is strong, again, it tends to taper off in the fourth quarter. Gregory Thaxton : But and Jeff, I\u2019ll just add a couple of comments, tying on to some of the comments that Mike made previously, what\u2019s exciting about the opportunities here are the tiering opportunities as we\u2019re reaching a different tier of customer base and what impact that may have on order patterns and seasonality of order patterns. But also the traction we\u2019ve made, as Mike mentioned, around the success with some new product launches and the opportunities that that also provides. So typical seasonality would suggest that strength at this time of year, but also encouraged by the opportunity we have in these penetration of different customers with new products, or different customers with our tiering opportunities. Michael Hilton : We\u2019ve talked in the past about from high-end dispense capability that we have, the precision on the dots to speed. We\u2019ve also launched a whole new product set of product lines in our test and inspection business, it\u2019s getting really good traction. And some like in our bond testing, which typically have been a back-end packaging environment, we\u2019re now pushing that into the tail end of the front-end and getting some traction on a much more sophisticated complex machines. It\u2019s not carrying the day, but it\u2019s kind of thing that\u2019s a leading indicator of broadening our product point. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, great. And then adhesives, it sounds like the biggest issue there is really just tough comps, but any markets really stand out that feel on the softer side, or is it just really just a tough issue? Michael Hilton : Yes, as I said earlier, if you look at sort of our core adhesives, the packaging business has been very strong and particularly given some of the headlines that have been out there around some of the consumer product companies that it\u2019s been very strong relative to that. Our product assembly that goes into a lot of different applications have been strong. Nonwovens has been solid, but has challenge of comparables year-on-year. I\u2019d say our \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, our pelletizing business tends to be digital with bigger projects. So the current orders, I said it\u2019s a little soft, but the project activity is solid. So I feel pretty good about the underlying pace of the business and maybe a little surprised on the upside of how solid the packaging is, given what might be some softer consumer numbers out there. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charles Brady : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Michael Hilton : Good morning, Charley. Gregory Thaxton : Good morning, Charley. Charles Brady : I just want to ask you about, you\u2019ve had this margin target out there off of 2015 margin of 200 basis points, I guess, by the end of this fiscal year. And I\u2019m just really trying to square that up, I mean, you didn\u2019t obviously update that yet, we\u2019re still halfway through. But I\u2019m just wondering, as you look at these acquisitions, a lot of them obviously here in the medical space, which tend to carry pretty good margins and, obviously, there\u2019s room for you guys to squeeze more out of that. Have you\u2019ve given any thought as to kind of what your longer-term targets beyond this initial target put out there might be to where longer-term margins can go? Michael Hilton : Yes. So Charley, just a couple of comments. As far as our 200 point target, we made great progress last year, as we mentioned at our year-end call. And we\u2019re essentially there in terms of the 200 point improvement. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of noise in the numbers, given all the acquisitions we\u2019ve been making recently, but we\u2019re essentially there. We\u2019re not going to stop, there\u2019s opportunities to continue to drive improvement. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re probably not ready to talk about our longer range target. So we\u2019re not going to stop with this improvement effort. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still working through the polymer consolidation that will yield some benefits in 2018, so we\u2019ll see some additional improvement there. So not necessarily coming out with a long range target, because there\u2019s a lot of noise in the short-term. And quite frankly, one of the reasons we put the EBITDA information out there is that, things can get a little confusing in the near-term, but the cash generation from the businesses, both organic and acquired is really a critical focus, I think, going forward, so we wanted to put that additional information. Charles Brady : Yes. No, I appreciate that incremental information. And it\u2019s back on the China comments and you answered part of them. But I\u2019m just wondering, I think, China was approaching 50% of advanced tech system sales. Is that \u2013 have we hit that 50% mark yet, or are we still approaching that, that\u2019s obviously driven by the China mobile phone market? Michael Hilton : Well, certainly, China is a strong part of the business, because you have a lot of the final assemblers are in China. But when you look at the extended supply chain for the electronics business, a lot of the components are not necessarily made in China. So if you think about camera modules and speakers and microphones and gyroscopes and all that stuff, there\u2019s an extended supply chain, that\u2019s not necessarily in China. So I\u2019d say, overall, probably two-thirds of the electronics business is still in Asia and in the short-term, it might be a little higher than that. But I wouldn\u2019t say, China is 50% of that given the broader supply chain. Gregory Thaxton : Yes, and I would add, Charley, some of the new product introductions, particularly in the T&I space are taking us to a customer base that also still resides in Asia, but not specific to China. So China is still, as Mike mentioned, is a big part. But I wouldn\u2019t suggest that it\u2019s greater than 50%. Charles Brady : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Walter Liptak : Hi, guys, thanks. Good morning and great quarter. Michael Hilton : Thanks, Walter. Good morning. Walter Liptak : I wanted to do a follow-up on what you alluded to earlier from one of the questions regarding the growth rates. And I wonder if the Vention business, if that what the growth rate was of that this quarter and is that in your 12-week order rates? Gregory Thaxton : Well, this is Greg. It is included in \u2013 from an organic perspective in our 12-week order rates. We don\u2019t break that that particular line of business out specifically. But in our most recent order rates, we would look at the current year for Vention, as well as the prior year, and that would find its way into that organic number, as well as then it\u2019s going to be in the acquisitive growth in our third quarter guidance. Michael Hilton : And as a general comment, Wal, when you look at the medical business, we have expectations of high single-digit, low double-digit kind of growth rates, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen historically and that\u2019s what we expect from the kind of businesses that we have. Walter Liptak : Okay, fair enough. And then I wanted to ask about corporate expenses and where we\u2019re \u2013 if you can give us an idea of 2017 corporate expenses, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a GAAP, non-GAAP number, but that would be helpful to? Thank you. Gregory Thaxton : Yes, okay. Well, it\u2019s Greg, again. In the current quarter \u2013 the second quarter in that corporate managed number, you\u2019ve got the transaction costs associated with Vention. So that\u2019s where you see the step-up. We\u2019ll have a minor amount in Q3 that will also show up in that corporate number. But for modeling purposes, I\u2019d expect that to trend back closer to what the run rate had been, call it, in that $10 million to $12 million per quarter range. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Hi, guys, good morning. Gregory Thaxton : Good morning, Allison. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: The margin is obviously very strong. But when I look at our expectations, the incrementals in the investments [Technical Difficulties] Michael Hilton : Hey, Allison, we\u2019re having a little trouble hearing you, maybe not close to the mike. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Is it better? Michael Hilton : Not really. Gregory Thaxton : Not much. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Okay, I\u2019ll try to yell, sorry. Incrementals in Industrial Coating seem a bit later than expected from our end. I\u2019m assuming, it\u2019s mix. Any color that you can provide there? Gregory Thaxton : Yes, Allison, it\u2019s Greg. It\u2019s primarily mix of the product lines with Industrial Coating. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: And are we assuming that\u2019s sort of a same level than perhaps in Q3, given your orders that have come in? Gregory Thaxton : Well, again, it\u2019s going to depend upon what the mix of those orders for the balance of the quarter. It\u2019s not only what sits in backlog, but what comes in during the quarter. The issue being, for example, our gross margin by product line whether it\u2019s a powder engineered system, or a liquid kind of standard system, container standard system have different margins, as well as than these spare parts gross margins. So really depends on the composition of the system sales, as well as the composition of parts to systems. Michael Hilton : There\u2019s nothing fundamentally going on with the margins in that business. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Trusz from Gabelli & Company. Matthew Trusz : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Matthew Trusz : So we talked about medical, we talked about electronics, could you also provide some color on what you\u2019re seeing in your industrial markets and what your sense is of the industrial economy more broadly? Michael Hilton : Yes. So far just a couple of comment. So a lot of our business goes into consumer non-durables, it\u2019s still probably about 40%-some of our business. And indicators of how that business is doing is around, say, our packaging business and that\u2019s been strong, as I mentioned earlier. When you look at our Product Assembly business in the Adhesive side of things, that\u2019s \u2013 a lot of that could be construction related, so windows, flooring, that kind of thing that\u2019s been solid, as well as also some electronics in that business. When you look at our Industrial Coatings business, the automobile sector has been strong for a number of years, that sort of feels like it\u2019s plateaued a little bit and maybe fewer platform orders coming through this year. Our Powder Coating business goes to a lot of \u2013 and liquid coating to a lot of general assembly, general machining kind of applications and that\u2019s been solid. And container business is more niche again back to the consumer product side. So, I\u2019d say, generally, we\u2019re seeing a solid market for investment, maybe the one area that\u2019s slowing down a little bit would be the auto sector from a platform standpoint. Matthew Trusz : Thank you. And then looking at the margin strength in ADS, it\u2019s 29% in the quarter. Could you speak to the role of product mix versus specific improvement at the polymers business, or is it just other factors like continuous improvement? Michael Hilton : Yes, I would say, one, the mix probably helped us a little bit in this quarter. But the primary focus has been around trying to deliver volume growth and the incremental margin comes from that and then our continuous improvement efforts. So we\u2019ve had strong continuous improvement efforts. We\u2019ve started to get some nice traction in the adhesive side on some new products like our adhesive tracking systems, which is helping in the package business as addition to the sales that we already provide. And then we\u2019ve come up with yet another tiered offering, as an example, in our nonwovens business, which is getting us into some lower tiers some in China, but outside of China and other developing countries. So whole new set of customers that we haven\u2019t tapped into before and that\u2019s a system designed and built in China for us. So we\u2019re starting to see some traction on new products in that business, which is helpful as well as the improvement in the polymer business from a cost perspective in the overall continuous improvement. So it\u2019s a number of things not just one. Matthew Trusz : Excellent. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. David Stratton : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Michael Hilton : Good morning. Gregory Thaxton : Good morning. David Stratton : Really quickly touch on the cadence of which you plan to pay down debt, I know, you\u2019ve highlighted aggressive pay down. But any color you can give around that for modeling purposes? Michael Hilton : I\u2019d just say, that\u2019s our primary focus. I mean, if you go to our capital deployment model, our primary focus is support organic growth, gave \u2013 Greg gave you some insight on what we think for the year there. And next is kind of continue our dividend trend. And then the third in the current environment is probably paying down debt and that\u2019s kind of our primary focus. If you go back a year or so ago after a fairly significant share buyback effort in 2015, we were able to delever within a year over a full point of a multiplier on the net debt-to-EBITDA. So that will be our focus here in the short-term. David Stratton : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Nordson Corporation for any closing comments. Michael Hilton : Well, I\u2019d just like to thank everyone for their interest and support, and again, compliment to our global team for doing an excellent job this quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. James Jaye : Thank you and good morning. I\u2019m here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Senior Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, August 22, 2017, to report Nordson\u2019s FY 2017 third quarter results and our FY 2017 fourth quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at Nordson.com /investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until September 5, 2017, which can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 62150013. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectation. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that Nordson delivered record results for revenue, operating profit, diluted EPS and EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. These results speak of the strong underlying performance across our base business, our focus on continuous improvement. I'll provide some highlights on our financial performance and let Greg provide more detail. We delivered 11% organic sales growth in the quarter compared to the prior year, with contributions from all segments and nearly all geographies. Acquisitions added another [audio break] to the top line and we continued to be pleased with how all of our news businesses are performing. Operating profit in the quarter improved 24% over the prior year and operating margin improved 1 percentage point compared to the same period a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 21% compared to the same period a year ago. These results include $6 million, or $0.07 per share diluted share of intangible asset amortization expense associated with four acquisitions we've completed in fiscal year-to-date. Given these increased non cash expenses in the quarter and our expectation for continued acquisition activity going forward, we believe additional focus on EBITDA measures better reflects our core operating results and offers greater transparency for investors. Looking at the current quarter, EBITDA, EBITDA margin and EBITDA per share all improved compared to the same period a year ago. Free cash flow before dividend in the quarter also improved compared to the prior year. And after the quarter closed, our Board approved an increase to our dividend, marking the 54th consecutive year we've increased our annual dividend. We are one of only 14 public companies to have increased their dividend for at least that number of years. Looking ahead our fourth quarter guidance reflects our backlog current 12 week order rate and challenging comparison to the same period a year ago where we generated 13% organic growth. At the low end of our fourth quarter guidance, we are on pace to deliver record full year performance across most metrics, including revenue, earnings and EBITDA. I feel very good about our 2017 performance both organic and acquisitive; we are well positioned for the future. I'll speak more about our outlook in a few minutes but first I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed commentary. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike. And good morning to everyone. Third quarter sales were $589 million, an increase of 20% from the prior year\u2019s third quarter. This change in sales included an 11% increase in organic volume, a 10% increase related to the first year effect of acquisition, and a less than 1% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter. Organic growth exceeded the high-end of our guidance driven by the strength across our all segments and nearly all geographies. Organic sales volume in the Adhesive Dispensing segment increased 6%, as compared to the prior year third quarter, where organic growth was also strong at 4%. This is the ninth consecutive quarter of organic growth in this segment. Our Packaging, nonwovens and polymer product lines drove the growth in the current quarter and all regions were positive with the exception of Europe. Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 42% from the prior year third quarter, inclusive of 18% organic volume growth and 24% growth related to the first year effect of acquisition. Customer demand for automated dispensing, test and inspection and surface treatment systems were robust across electronics end markets. With additional strength coming from demand in our medical end markets. All regions delivered strong organic growth compared to the prior year most by double digit. Segments acquisitive growth includes the first year effect of the LinkTech, ACE, Interselect, Plas-Pak and Vention acquisitions. Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coatings segment increased 3% compared to the third quarter a year ago. Cold material, liquid painting and UV curing product lines drove the growth with the Americas and Asia -Pacific being the strongest geography. Gross margin for the total company in the quarter was 55% or 56% and equal to the prior year when excluding $1.7 million of one-time purchase accounting charges with the step up of acquired inventory in the current fiscal quarter. These charges are now behind us. Operating profit for the total company in the quarter improved 24% to $153 million and reported operating margin improved 1 percentage point to 26%, both compared to the prior year's third quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 28% in the quarter excluding the one time charges called out in the EPS reconciliation in our financial exhibit and also excluding the $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to current year acquisition. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, reported operating margin was 28% in the quarter, an improvement of 1 percentage point compared to the prior year's period and inclusive of approximately $700,000 in restructuring charges related to facility consolidation. Operating margin for the segment was 29% without this charge. Within the Advanced Technologies segment, reported operating margin was 30% in the third quarter, or 33% when excluded purchase accounting charges of approximately $1.7 million for the step up and value of acquired inventory and the $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to the current year acquisitions. Within the Industrial Coatings segment, reported operating margin was 20% in the quarter, an improvement of 3 percentage points compared to the same period a year ago related to improved product mix. This is continued strong operating margin performance by all three segments and reflects our ongoing continuous improvement efforts. For the company, net income for the quarter was $101 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.74. Adjusted diluted EPS in the current quarter was $1.78; a 21% increase over the prior year adjusted diluted EPS. We have included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings per share. Third quarter EBITDA increased 29% to $179 million. EBITDA margin improved 2 percentage points to 30% and EBITDA per diluted share increased 27% to $3.08, all compared to the prior year's third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $182 million, or $3.12 per diluted share, a 29% increase over the prior year. Cash flow from operations increased 13% compared to the prior year's third quarter to $77 million and free cash flow before dividend increased 14% compared to the prior year to $55 million. All of these measures highlight the strong cash generation of the overall business. We've included tables with our press release reconciling net income to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow before dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt-to- trailing 12 months EBITDA inclusive of acquired EBITDA was 2.7x at the end of the third quarter, down from 3x at the end of the second quarter. This level is well below our most restricted debt covenants leaving us with additional debt capacity. And at the end of the quarter, we had approximately $368 million of combined cash and availability on a revolver. As we\u2019ve demonstrated, our strong cash generation enables us to deliver quickly, which remains our intent in the near-term. I\u2019ll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter of FY2017. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks, as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency-neutral basis and with acquisitions included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending August 13, 2017, order rates are down 2%, as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. This is a challenging comparison to the same period to the prior year ago where order rates were up 16%. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are down 1% compared to the same period a year ago. Strength in packaging and nonwovens product lines was offset by softness in general product assembly and polymer product lines. Strength in Europe and Asia- Pacific was offset by other region. In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are down 3%, as compared to the prior year, where order rates were up 29%. Some electronics project activity occurred earlier in the year as compared to last year, benefiting our third quarter sales and our ability to respond to these shifts remains a competitive advantage. Within our current order rates, strength in our test and inspection product lines serving electronic end markets was offset by softness in other product lines mostly electronics related due to project timing and challenging prior year comparisons. Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are down 4% as compared to the prior year where order rates were up 36%. Strength in powder, liquid and container product lines was offset by softness in cold material product lines. Europe was the strongest regionally. Backlog at July 31, 2017 was approximately $372 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year, and inclusive of 13% acquisitive growth, offset by a 3% decline in organic business. Backlog amounts are calculated at July 31, 2017 exchange rates. Let me now turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We\u2019re forecasting sales to increase in the range of 4% to 8%, as compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. This growth includes organic volume of down 3% to down 7%, 10% growth from the first year effect of acquisitions and a positive currency effect of 1% based on the current exchange rate environment. At the midpoint of this outlook, we expect fourth quarter gross margin to be approximately 54% and operating margin to be approximately 21%. This margin performance includes $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to current year acquisitions. We\u2019re estimating fourth quarter interest expense of about $10 million, deprecation and amortization expense of about $25 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 29%, resulting in fourth quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.18 to $1.32 per diluted share. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $133 million to $144 million, or $2.27 per share to $2.46 per diluted share. And finally we are forecasting fourth quarter capital spending to be similar to the year-to-date run rate. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Greg. I want to thank our team for delivering another outstanding quarter. Revenue, operating profit, diluted EPS and EBITDA were records for any Nordson quarter. In terms of our fourth quarter, our guidance reflects a very challenging comparison to the same period a year ago where we generated 13% organic growth. We are on pace to deliver record full year performance on most metrics. At the midpoint of this guidance, full year organic sales growth is 6%. So the excellent performance and it's on top of our robust 7% organic sales growth we delivered in fiscal 2016. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share at midpoint is $5.24, an increase of 12% compared to fiscal 2016. Again, I'll point that fiscal 2017 adjusted diluted EPS per share includes intangible asset amortization expense related to this year's four acquisitions or approximately $15 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we believe additional focus on EBITDA measures which exclude these non cash expenses better reflect our core operating results and offers greater transparency for investors. At the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, fiscal 2017 EBITDA increases to 16% to $535 million. EBITDA margin increases 1 percentage point to 26% and EBITDA per diluted share increases 15% to $9.19, all compared to the prior fiscal year. This is very strong performance. Our continued ability to generate high levels of cash provides us with the ability to fund multiple initiatives. In the near term, de-leveraging is likely to remain our priority for capital deployment. But we've also have capacity to execute on execution target in our pipeline if and when they become available. Overall, we are well positioned across the diverse end market we serve. Our global team remains focused on creating shareholder value by offering customers innovative technology solutions and outstanding support. Again, 2017 will be a strong year on a top of a very strong 2016. With that we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning. Just in terms of the organic guidance for fiscal Q4, down 3% to down 7% orders down too, are we to read from that that as the 12 week period progressed you saw further weakening on a year-over-year basis in order to get that guidance. I clearly recognize you are up against very tough comparisons but just a little more granularity on the sequencing of orders as you progress to this latest 12 week period please. Mike Hilton : Yes. I wouldn't necessarily say that, that's what we\u2019re seeing. What I would say if you look at our typical annual pattern of orders I think as you know well, they decline in the fourth quarter to a low point sort of in January and they peak somewhere in the third or fourth quarter. I'd say what we are seeing is a strong peak that\u2019s come through in the third quarter and seasonally trailing off whereas last year we had the strongest peak in the early part of the fourth quarter and that's what you are seeing here is a little bit across there just based on the timing of the peak in the year. And I wouldn't say that we are seeing orders necessarily slow down in the last - in the 12 weeks. It's really more about the year-on-year comparison. Matt Summerville : And then just a follow up. I clearly I recognize it's early it's only August. You guys are going to be up against a pretty tough organic comparison at least through the first three fiscal quarters of 2018 as you look at the key organic drivers across the businesses, the underlying momentum you see today what's your level of conviction that you are able to grow organically looking out over a little bit of longer period of time. Again bearing in mind you still have some tough comp to digest beyond what you are digesting today. Thank you. Mike Hilton : Okay. Yes, so what I would say is a couple of things. I think we said at the beginning of this year we saw global economy grow at 2% to 2.5% and we would grow at a multiple of that on an organic basis and certainly we've -- we are in a position to do that for this year. I think as you look forward we expect over the long run that's the kind of growth rate that we are going to see because we have some quarters where we are off a little bit, and other quarters we are stronger just like the third and fourth quarter you are seeing here. Yes, but the fundamentals are strong in our business. We are well positioned across all of our end markets from a competitive standpoint. We see nice growth driven by new product innovation. We are continuing to adjust our portfolio to provide higher growth parts of the business like the medical additions that we are doing but also support high margins and help with cyclicality in our business. And we still have strong part of our business that's related to consumer non durable products. So as I look at it we feel good about our growth prospects for the business and the mix that we currently have in the business is improving with the acquisitions that we've made this year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys. I understand kind of the order decline in Advanced Tech and Industrial Coatings just given the comps, but little surprised by the order decline in adhesive and maybe you could just speak more to that. Was there any kind of noise or lumpiness that would have impacted that and maybe just talk about forward visibility in adhesive? Mike Hilton : Yes. If I look at [indiscernible] adhesive business, we do have a couple elements of the business that are project orient like our product assembly business and some of our polymer related businesses. And so I think there you got some quarter-on-quarter comparison just when those projects have come through. If you look at sort of our core packaging nonwovens kind of businesses the ones that are focused on the consumer non durable space, they are doing well year-on-year and the momentum is continuing there. So I think what we are seeing is just a little bit of lumpiness year-on-year on some of those more project oriented product lines within the business. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then in advanced tech I think you cited on order front, certainly the comps but then some project timing within electronics, can you maybe speak to a little more clarification what you are seeing on that project timing? Mike Hilton : Yes. So what we saw and it's reflected somewhat in the third quarter is customers ask us to pull forward deliveries to meet their needs and that's probably impacted our overall performance by a couple of percentage points in the quarter. So that's good for the third quarter probably pulled out in the fourth quarter but one of the competitive advantages that we have in addition to be in the strongest technology player out there is our ability to flex to meet the customers' demand and so what we really did is work hard to sync with the delivery schedule that they were looking for. I'd say under the -- on the underlying part of the business a lot of positives to think about there. We are doing well in the mobile segment and continuing to diversify into the Chinese mobile players. We are doing well in new applications like the semiconductor side. Our whole new platform in test and inspection area with new products is doing very well. So I'd say underlying business is very solid and our positions are strong. We do have the seasonality in the business and can vary quarter-to-quarter, year-on-year and that's more of what we are seeing right now. So we feel good about how we are positioned in that business. And then of course the other part of this advanced tech business which is equal in size now will be larger next year is non electronics which is delivering very solid and consistent performance with strong growth and good margin. Jeffrey Hammond : And Mike is there a way to quantify maybe on EPS or revenue basis how much of that -- how much of a pull forward you saw? Because it looks like you kind of came in $0.10 ahead of consensus and maybe similarly like on 4Q. Thanks. Mike Hilton : Yes. I'd say probably on the revenue side it might be a couple of percentage points so that will translate down to more on the earnings, I am not sure it all $0.10 but it's probably pretty close to that. So our view we knew we had a strong second half year of comp and I think if you look at collectively third and fourth quarter we feel pretty good about where we are at. Greg Thaxton : Yes, this is Greg. I'd just echo Mike's comments there and put a little bit of context around that where we exceeded even the top end of the guidance for our quarterly revenue growth, much of that is related to the volume that we are talking about. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys, good morning. Could you touch on progress in Vention? Is it -- how is it proceeding as expectations, above, below, any color there? Mike Hilton : Yes. So we are very pleased with Vention business. I'd say it's right on plan for our top line and bottom line expectations. The pipeline of new projects looks very healthy in that business and we like the business model that's come with that in terms of the ability to provide upfront design through final solutions there. So we feel very good about that. And the integration is going just as planned and we feel really great about the team that's come with that business and the capabilities that they bring. Greg Thaxton : And Allison just to remind everybody, an attractive part of this now about 20% of total Nordson portfolio on a go forward basis is strong operating margin and accretive on the EBITDA margin to our base business. So we expect to continue to see the growth that we've experienced traditionally in those medical end markets and now that\u2019s a kind of $300 million size portion of the business will be a good platform and portfolio. Allison Poliniak : That's great. And then ultimately look at across the businesses in Q4, outside of seasonality; are there any mix issues to be mindful of in terms of EBIT margin? Mike Hilton : No. I don't think any significant mix. I mean obviously when volumes goes down we have an impact on margin in the short term year-over-year. But I'd say no significant mix effects in that. Greg Thaxton : No. And just again to elaborate there as you think about our fourth quarter at that what we have in our outlook is well first off that there is about a percentage point related to these incremental non cash charges related to the acquisitions. And then in a period where we are forecasting negative organic that's going to have a margin impact as Mike noted. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charles Brady : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Just on the advanced tech and medical business, you obviously decide that up for us, how much -- can you break how much that business grew the medical piece, life science piece in the quarter? Mike Hilton : Well, overall we expect that business to grow double digits and it did that in the quarter and I think our view long term of medical is the market itself is probably only 5%, there were some of the other trends like the outsourcing to drive to plastic some of the minimally invasive procedures that Vention has get us into now, we expect double digit growth in the long run and that came in with double digit kind of growth. Charles Brady : Great. And just that on your comment on use of capital focusing on de-leveraging I mean you are not super over there right now you are under 3x, I am just wondering is there a level you want to take that to or is it a more function of how the M&A pipeline looks and kind of timing of that pipeline and it just didn't actionable item to close so focus on the de-leveraging instead? Mike Hilton : Well our primary -- if you look at our priorities at capital deployment they haven't really changed if you go back. Number one, support organic growth. We are going to continue to do that. Number two, the dividends piece that we mentioned here. Number three is offsetting any kind of comp dilution which is marginal. But number four is we like to do M&A transactions, number one you can't always predict the timing although we've got some interesting things so we think are in the pipeline and related to that as you want to have the capacity of some more sizeable opportunities come forward. And so in the short term our focus is really around creating the capacity for more sizeable opportunities. Charles Brady : Okay. So, yes so just to clarify then the M&A focus or the M&A desire hasn't shifted at all, it's still kind of what it was before and this kind of positioning -- [Multiple Speakers] Mike Hilton : It's just -- obviously we can't control the timing but what we can control is being prepared appropriately and as you've seen in the past if things are little slow on the M&A front and there is an opportunistic moment with the variability in the market to buyback shares we've done that too. Right now our primary focus is on de-leveraging to create capacity for us to do more acquisitions that make sense in our strategic areas of focus. Charles Brady : Can you talk about from a margin standpoint of the impact of the acquisitions you had, purchase accounting aside, the opportunity you have once you are folding these businesses in to really leverage some of that up and push the margins higher on a kind of go forward basis over the next 24 months or so. Mike Hilton : Yes. I think we've certainly commented on the medical acquisition but the other acquisitions, particularly one that added to EFD or similar kind of margins to the company and EBITDA margin accretive and so we also feel as we continue to grow and scale those businesses we will be able to improve margins through continuous improvement activities for those businesses. So we feel good about the opportunity like we do at all our businesses to grow and expand with already as a good starting point. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, I am just wondered if we could do a little deeper dive, stating on some of the new market penetration dynamics and the China Tier 2 trajectory maybe an inning engage or something like that some of the other initiatives that have been developing. Mike Hilton : Okay. Let me just make a couple, we'll start there with the mobile side. I mean obviously we are well positioned with the sort of global leaders there and this is turned out to be pretty strong year in that regard. With the mobile players we've seen them significantly increased their adoption of automation from something that was almost non existence probably two years ago to a nice first step next year to significantly stepping up this year. Still not to the kinds of levels of automation -- sort of the global leaders but making really good progress so there is more to go on an inning basis that probably less than halfway they are compared to these global leaders. And it's not clear whether they will go all the way or not but clearly they are seeing the benefits of automation in terms of quality and throughput and overall cost benefit associated with that. In addition, in the electronics areas we've talked about doing more on the front end and dispensing on wafer and test inspection on wafer and we are seeing some progress there. We've also seen some progress in terms of revitalization of our total test inspection product line that really has seen a nice uptick as the semiconductor industry in general front end and back end is having pretty solid year. So those new products are really getting traction. If you look at then non electronics part of our advanced tech business in the medical space it's all about broadening capabilities, new products getting plugged into the front end and we've got both good prospects and good traction there and in the non electronics non medical piece, we've introduced some new products in terms of refreshing our total valve of portfolio and some of our mixing technology which is also getting good traction. If you look at our sort of core adhesive business, I mentioned earlier we are doing well in the packaging, nonwovens areas as an example but we continue to make good progress on tiering. We've introduced yet another new tiering sort of applications in our core adhesive dispensing that's really opened up a yet a whole new set of customers to us which we will see ultimately up to a higher level. And then in our coatings business, we are doing a lot of work in the sort of cold material side which is opening up aerospace for example to us as an opportunity as the industry looks to find ways to basically get more plane out the door, and they look for automation there as an opportunity and we are making good progress there. So I feel good about the new products, new market opportunities that we have in the business and we will continue to grow over the next few years. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. And just follow on up on the mobile, wondering if you could comment on the relative contribution of the adoption in China versus the global leaders in the quarter you reported. And if you see a dynamic where following all the really dramatic innovation and the global leaders this year if that pretends particular ramp in the secondary players. Mike Hilton : Well, we've seen solid step up here maybe look at the global statistics, certainly the shares of the top three Chinese players have probably grown, lot of that in China, some of that starting to be outside China, this is a pretty robust year and as I said there is more opportunity for automation. I think the overall supply chain in the electronics area given the growth in the sort of established players and the new players are pretty stretched. I mean we are in a good position to supply all over the opportunity but in other areas maybe little stretched in the short term. So I think is opportunity as we go forward for that to loosen up a little bit and some opportunities for further growth. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks, good morning. I want to just ask a follow on the adhesive segment. Maybe to ask this way the comp didn't look that tough because the 12-week orders last year were up two and now you are down one. And in your answer you called out that there was some -- wasn't sure I understood with polymers or product assembly, what's going on, is it -- are you saying that order will pull forward or that they were just orders in the pipeline that you are still waiting to book. Mike Hilton : Well, any one quarter we can have -- they tend to first of all be bigger individual quarters so any 12-week period of time you can have something it looks like a little bit of anomaly because you got a big project last year, you don't have that in this 12- week order this year. So that's really all I was trying to talk about that. I think underlying fundamentals are pretty solid. And if you think about our sort of adhesive business through, it will be in the fourth year in a row where we are seeing nice growth and it will be soft macro economy for well established businesses. So I feel good about look what the team is delivering there. Just quarter-to-quarter you can in a 12-week comparison you could have a big project last year that's not in this 12-week order and two weeks from now it is reversed. Okay, so I don't feel like any significant turnaround the underlying performance of those markets, it's really just the quarter-- the 12-week comparison. Greg Thaxton : And Walter just to add a couple of comments, this is Greg. As we've talked about the pull forward that was specifically related to advanced technology so not really in adhesive and as we've mentioned earlier if you take some of the product line that we would consider kind of more run rate product lines that are more heavily tied to non consumer non durable of packaging for example, the nonwovens, those were pretty robust those order rates. So it's -- as well as some of the product lines within polymer. It's the more system project related product line that Mike mentioned you are going to get from time to time some comparison that are just related to the timing of those projects not necessarily indicative of a competitive position or general underlying condition. Walter Liptak : Okay, right. So the systems are related to product assembly, is it correct? Mike Hilton : Yes and probably one or two product lines in the polymer area. So but again I think what Greg is trying to say is in that case we have bigger projects and they can swing the 12 week order rate if one year has big projects and the next year you don't. And two weeks later it could reverse. Greg Thaxton : If you look at some prior quarters of going into the quarter what the order pattern was, it wouldn't be uncommon to see order growth rate having end of the quarter, I think last quarter was up one and we delivered 6% organic growth. So it's the run rate business with those orders can continue to flow through the quarter. And then as that project activity comes, its timing related issue. Walter Liptak : Okay, all right. So the way that you are describing it sounds like there are still more product assembly systems, polymer systems in the pipeline which will result in decent growth kind of going forward. Is that correct? Mike Hilton : Yes, there is no concern on the long-term basis. Quarter-to-quarter you can some anomaly as a result of timing of projects that's all we are saying. Walter Liptak : Okay, all right, great. And then I think last quarter you guys talked about the 200 basis points program running up that you had nice successful period of margin improvement and some consolidation and other things. How should we think about new projects the next two years of projects? Can you get another 200 basis points for example a margin improvement? Mike Hilton : Yes. So we haven't said we stop there. We will continue to drive our continuous improvement effort. We will see some further benefit when we get through the line of consolidations on our polymer business next year. And we have some other longer term things that we are looking at and I'd say probably not ready for prime time in addition to our normal drive. I think 200 basis points with no volume growth in the near term is probably a stretch, but we are continuing to drive the programs that we do have and we've got very robust program. So I feel good about where we are at. I feel good about where we have in the pipeline not ready to commit a couple hundred basis points with no volume like we did the last time at this point yet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Liam Burke with FBR Capital. Your line is open. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg. Mike on the adhesive front you mentioned polymer being contributor to growth. In terms of operating margin how have -- as the polymer business progressed? Are at the levels that you are satisfied with their level of profitability at that part of the business? Mike Hilton : So the margins are improving. No, we are not satisfied yet. We are still in the middle of this last phase of restructuring. So in the short term you are seeing the hit in terms of the restructuring cost and not yet the benefit of having consolidated and upgraded the equipment. So I think next year we will be in a more normalized role and beyond that we finished final relocation in the early part of next year maybe first calendar quarter or so and then after that we should see the full benefits. So we are not there yet. Liam Burke : Okay. And on the medical front you are seeing health growth. It's been a priority on the acquisition front. How are you sized for capacity? Mike Hilton : So I would say we continue to expand. For example, we built the new facility in Colorado for our components business. We've expanded once double the size of Mexico now we are expanding again in Mexico. With Vention acquisition we've added five or six new facilities that have some capacity in that but given the growth rates that we have down the road we will expect the need to expand further. And that's in our plan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. David Stratton : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just a follow up only a few questions left really for me and mainly regarding Vention, was that accretive in the quarter? And if so by how much? Mike Hilton : We said it's probably accretive in the quarter after the second quarter and we expected for the year to be in that sort of $0.05 to $0.10 and I think we are on track with that. So we feel that's the acquisition is right where we expected it to be. David Stratton : Got you. And then geographically speaking it seems like every region is doing pretty well with the exception of maybe Europe and adhesive, and if you talk about that a little bit I'll appreciate it. Mike Hilton : Yes. So I'd say Europe is actually doing reasonably well for us. There is a couple areas where given the large OEM base you can see some swings quarter-to-quarter and I think if you look at this quarter was probably off a little bit in terms of actual performance but that's really function of some of the things we were talking about earlier with the larger project activity. I think in our order a rate that's encouraging. So I'd say underlying this year Europe is playing out reasonably well. But again you can some anomalies project to project so in this quarter is probably little bit off but the order rates look encouraging for the next quarter, year-on-year I think it will be solid year for Europe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Trusz with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Matthew Trusz : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a follow up on the Europe order rates question. If we turn to The United States, down 6% might be surprising even considering comp last year. Can you provide some additional color and what you are seeing geographically there? And whether that's project noise or something fundamental going on? Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say it's mainly project related activity. I'd say one area that we haven't talked about yet that was particularly strong last year that's a little soft year the whole auto space and not generally -- because the production levels are high and there is a lot of work for us in the body shop piece and the electronic side but we had some larger platform orders last year and platform orders mean model changes, significant model changes. And that's not repeated itself and that's one of the things affecting the US. Greg Thaxton : Yes, this is Greg. I'll just add additional color there. We are up against the pretty challenging comp to last year where we were up 9% total in the US and that cold material or auto focus that Mike mentioned is part of an answer. And then again you kind of go back to in the current quarter as we talked at the total portfolio level, the kind of the timing of some of those systems orders and as that would have affect adhesive as well. So where the US was impacted it was primarily in the industrial coating segment and adhesive and that has to do with those, the timing of the system orders. Matthew Trusz : Great. Thank you for the color. And then secondly just following up on the M&A discussion. Can you talk about the interplay between the availability you are seeing in medical and other attractive assets versus what the valuation like in the marketplace? And where you are identifying interesting opportunities outside of medical? Mike Hilton : Yes. So if you look at medical space, the one good thing is it's still fairly fragmented. There is an opportunity to have differentiated positions through technology and support and service. The business is generally tended to have good profitability and high growth rates and so you need to pay a premium price to get them and that hasn't changed in the last year or so. We still see quite a few opportunities there and I'd say it is probably their primary focus is in the short term. Beyond that we have sort of three other areas that we've identified as interest to us. In the cold material space, we think about as atmospheric dispensing of adhesive and coating and sealants. There are a lot of smaller players there that we have interest in. They are just -- none of them have come to market yet other than the acquisitions we've made a couple of years ago in sealant and equipment and engineering. I'd say we still have some inspection areas of interest, electronics and closely adjacent market and I'd say we are pretty good on the polymer area. We are also in the process of longer term identifying what are the next couples of areas that we have interest in and we've got work ongoing but we are not ready for prime time on that yet. Operator : Thank you. And we have a follow up question from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi, yes, thanks for taking my follow up. I kind of along the lines with geographic, the Contra Cup is in Japan and in Asia Pac and so I was wondered you kind of addressed already the visibility and they kind of fundamental robust this year end market but I wondered if you could talk specifically about Asia and Japan and kind of what you are seeing from those economies and kind of new order pipeline? Mike Hilton : Yes. I'd say Asia in general has been pretty solid. China had their kind of new normal 6%-7% has been solid for us. Asia outside of China and Japan has been solid. Underlying Japan has been reasonable. We are just seeing in the fourth quarter just timing largely driven by the electronics market when you think about most of the final assembly and packaging folks are in China and Taiwan and lesser extent to Korea and then a lot of the components suppliers that would go into the mobile and other electronics business are in Japan. So when you think about camera module and speakers and things like that. But I think what you are really seeing is a lot of that activity being earlier in the year particularly late second and third quarter. And last year trended more into the fourth quarter at least probably half way through the fourth quarter. So that's really what you are seeing here underlying economies, Japan has been solid, China has been solid, outside those two in Asia good year so again kind of the new normal for China you need to take into account but solid year in general. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. Mike Hilton : Well, I just want to thank everyone for participating this morning. I think I want to leave you with just one message that we have a very strong year that we are expecting to deliver here. We are very well positioned with the changes that we've made to the portfolio through the acquisitions to both add to our growth, support our high level of performance from a margin perspective and reduce cyclicality in the overall business. So I feel good about how we are positioned going forward. I just want to thank our team for delivering another stellar quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Nordson Corporation Conference Call today, December 14, 2017 to report Fiscal Year 2017 Fourth Quarter Results and Fiscal Year 2018's First Quarter outlook. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on Nordson's webpage at Nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay for the conference call available until December 28, 2017. This can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 7396249. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After remarks on the quarter, there will be a question-and-answer session. With that being said, I will like to introduce Mike Hilton, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nordson Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's 2017 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined by Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to begin by recognizing the outstanding effort of our global team for delivering full year record-sales operating process, earnings per share and EBITDA. Our commitment to meeting our customers' needs and delivering the best technology solutions continues to be our priority, helping us surpass $2 billion in annual revenue this year. I'll provide some highlights on our record-setting financial performance and Greg will offer more detailed commentary. Looking at the fourth quarter, organic growth of 2% was driven by a strong demand in the electronics end market, along with solid growth in medical and those end market serving the Adhesive Dispensing segment. Against very challenging comparisons of year ago where total company organic growth increased 13%, this quarter's performance exceeded our guidance. Our recent acquisitions added 10% growth for the quarter, the sales volume coupled with our continuous improvement initiatives resulted in EBITDA growth of 17% and EBITDA margin improvement of about 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter as compared to the same period a year ago. Also during the quarter, we increased our annual dividend by 11%, marking our 54th consecutive year of dividend increases. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was solid and in what again was a very strong year for Nordson. Looking ahead to the New Year, our backlog indicates another robust first quarter for fiscal 2018. Our guidance for the quarter is very strong and is largely driven by our Advanced Technology segment where strong demand in electronics and medical end markets is driving performance. I'll speak more about our outlook in a few moments, but first, I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed perspective on the fourth quarter and our first quarter guidance. Greg? Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'll first provide some comments on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year results before moving on to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Fourth quarter sales were $574 million, an increase of 13% over the prior year's fourth quarter. This change in sales included a 2% increase in organic volume; the 10% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions; and the 1% increase related to the favorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Organic growth exceeded the high end of our guidance range driven primarily by strong demand in electronics end market. Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, sales in Adhesive Dispensing segment increased 6% as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, inclusive of 4% organic volume growth and 2% related to favorable effects of currency translation. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of organic growth in the segment, where all product lines in nearly all regions drove the increase in the current quarter. Within the Advanced Technology segment, sales volume increased 29% from the prior year fourth quarter, inclusive of 4% organic volume growth and 25% growth related to the first year effect of acquisitions. The effects of currency translation were immaterial. This is outstanding performance that exceeded our expectations considering the difficult comparison to the prior year fourth quarter where organic growth for this segment was 30%. Strong demand from electronics and medical end markets drove the current quarter's growth. We continue to benefit from the ongoing changing technology in the marketplace and our ability to broaden our application solutions. Regionally, growth was strongest in Japan with the Americas and U.S. also adding to this growth. This segment's acquisitive growth includes one month of a fiscal 2016 LinkTech acquisition and the fiscal 2017 acquisitions of Ace, Interselect, Plas-Pak and Vention. Organic sales volume in the industrial coating segment decreased 8% where this segment was also up against the very challenging comparison to the fourth quarter a year ago where organic volume growth was 12%. Customer demand in most product lines was offset by strong prior year performance in our cold material product line. Europe and Japan were strongest geographically in the current quarter. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 54% in the quarter and operating profit improved 13% to $125 million as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter where reported operating margin of 22% in the quarter. This performance includes approximately $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to acquisitions made in the current year which dilutes operating margin by a full basis point. Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 28% in the fourth quarter. This was an impressive improvement of 4 percentage points driven by changes in product mix and fewer restructuring charges as compared to the prior year. The current quarter includes approximately $1 million in restructuring charges related to facility consolidation efforts. Within the Advanced Technology segment, reported operating margin was 24% in the fourth quarter or 26% when excluding $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to current year acquisition. Industrial Coating segment delivered operating margin of 18% in the fourth quarter, down from the prior year's exceptional performance due to volume leverage in mix, but still strong performance for this segment. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $80 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.37, a 5% increase over the prior year GAAP diluted earnings per share. The $6 million of intangible asset amortization charges in the current quarter where current year acquisitions reduced earnings per share by $0.07. As Mike noted, we delivered strong fourth quarter EBITDA of $150 million, a 17% increase over the prior year fourth quarter and EBITDA margin improved 1 percentage point to 26% as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Cash flow from operations was $133 million and free cash flow before dividends was $111 million or 139% of net income, highlighting our continued focus on liquidity. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. I'll now share a few comments on our full year results. Sales for fiscal 2017 were $2.1 billion, inclusive of very strong organic growth of 8% as compared to the prior year, which also was a strong year for Nordson. The first year effective acquisitions added 7% sales growth and we continue to be pleased with the performance of these acquisitions. Full year operating profit was $458 million, which is an increase of 18% over the prior year and inclusive of approximately $15 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to current year acquisitions. Reported operating margin was 22% or 24% on an adjusted basis to exclude both the effective one-time charges highlighted in the EPS reconciliation financial exhibit and the $15 million intangible asset amortization expense, representing a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year's adjusted operating margin. Net income for the full year was $296 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.08. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% over the prior year to $5.37. Both EPS amounts include the $0.18 per share of charges for intangible asset amortization expense for fiscal 2017 acquisitions. A reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings per share is included within the financial exhibits to our press release. EBITDA for the full year increased 19% to $547 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to $565 million, both compared to the prior year. EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were 26% and 27% respectively, both up over 100 basis points as compared to the prior year. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA inclusive of acquired EBITDA was just under 2.5x at the end of the fourth quarter. We generated $282 million of free cash flow before dividends and distributed $64 million in dividends for a payout ratio of 22%. I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We entered the quarter with strong momentum where as of October 31, 2017; backlog was approximately $402 million, an increase of 45% compared to the prior year, inclusive of 28% organic growth and 17% growth due to acquisition. Backlog amounts are calculated at October 31, 2017 exchange rates. We're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 30% to 34% as compared to the first quarter a year ago. This growth includes organic volume growth of 15% to 19%, 11% growth from the first year effective acquisitions and the positive currency effect of 4% based on the current exchange rate environment. At the midpoint of this outlook, we expect first quarter gross margin to be about 55% and operating margin to be approximately 22% or 23% excluding $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense associated with fiscal 2017 acquisitions. EBITDA margin is forecasted at 27% for the quarter as compared to 23% for the prior year's first quarter. We're estimating first quarter interest expense of about $11 million, depreciation and amortization expense of about $25 million and an effective tax rate of 29% based on current tax law resulting in first quarter forecast of GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.29 to $1.39 per diluted share. The CPS range is inclusive of the $6 million or $0.07 per diluted share of intangible asset amortization expense related to the fiscal 2017 acquisitions. These charges did not occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $141 million to $150 million. In addition to this first quarter outlook, the following full year data points may be helpful where our effective tax rate were forecasting the full year rate to be 29% based on current tax law and we're forecasting capital spending to be approximately $60 million. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. This is outstanding performance for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. I want to again thank our global team for helping us deliver these record results for fiscal 2017. Our first quarter guidance is very strong, largely driven by the Advanced Technology segment where strong demand in electronics and medical end markets is driving performance. Our diversification efforts to drive growth through new applications, technology and tiering are paying off and our recent acquisitions are off to a good start. With a short-cycled nature of our end markets, we have limited visibility to sales beyond the first quarter. However, we do anticipate future organic sales growth to moderate to more typical levels beyond our first quarter, particularly giving the challenging comparisons from a strong fiscal 2017. Our strategic priorities for the year remain consistent with prior years and will continue to be focused on driving our growth initiatives across each segment. From an [indiscernible] perspective, we'll continue to target high-quality companies in our targeted space and we'll continue to use tools within the Nordson business system to drive operating improvement across the enterprise. With that, we'll pause now and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thank you. Good morning. Can you first talk about the Advanced Tech business and whether there's a clearly-defined timing element to this? I guess the best word may be described as the surge you anticipate in your business in Q1? Whether that's a handful of projects, a few customer concentrations that's driving that or this is indeed something more broad-based and then also historically you've given quarterly order data. Is there are reason you're not providing that and if so, are you able to provide it in response to the question? Mike Hilton : Yes. Let me comment on the first piece. What we've seen really in the tail end of our fourth quarter and into the first quarter is continuing strong demand in the electronic segment. A good portion of that is mobile-related. But also, we're seeing some large orders related to some underlying growth in newer technologies. For one example, that would be moving from rigid to flex circuits to provide some more flexibility to customers with smaller design footprints. What I'd say is that we saw a couple of large projects come through, some of that supporting mobile directly, some of that more broadly-based. So obviously we've had a pretty strong year of mobile introductions this year and that has continued a little bit into the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. At a high level, that's what we're seeing on the electronic side. As far as the guidance around orders, let me give you our thought process here. We've been thinking about the order guidance for quite a while. Originally, we provided that because we thought it was providing additional insight with regard to underlying run rate across the business. But more recently over the last couple of years, we've seen through the order rates be out of whack a little bit with backlog and/or our sales guidance. And the reasons behind that are a couple of fold [ph]. The mix of our business has changed with the growth in the Advanced Technology segment, both in electronics and now in the medical business. Particularly in the electronics side, our delivery windows have been shrinking and the timing of orders year-to-year has varied pretty considerably. In addition, we have some customers who places orders for large projects, but look at deliveries over multiple quarters. We've found ourselves in situations where we're explaining why our sales guidance looks out [indiscernible] with our order growth rate and we thought a more consistent way to look at things was to give you sort of the backlog at the end of the quarter and then our guidance going forward that takes all of those kinds of things into effect. And we also were getting feedback from many of our shareholders that they were getting confused by order rate data and it wasn't necessarily healthy to provide additional insight. That's why we decided to make that change. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just one follow-up with respect to Advanced Tech; as I look at the incremental margins in the fourth quarter, if I back out, I think the $6 million of intangibles amortization, I come up with a number in the high 20s, which isn't a bad number per se, but I guess I would think with the high positive volume gain, maybe that number would be a little bit higher. So going forward -- and I assume you're going to continue to include the intangibles amortization as you've laid it out in your guidance -- what's sort of the right way to think about the incrementals in Advanced Tech going forward? Greg Thaxton : Matt, this is Greg. What I'll add there is we did see good volume growth success in the fourth quarter, but that was largely acquisitive growth. We had low single-digit growth on an organic basis and what we had suggested in prior quarters was the operating margin excluding the intangible asset amortization for those acquisitions was very near the opt margins of that segment. Have we seen stronger organic growth? Or when we see stronger organic growth, that's where we see very strong incremental margins helping lift margins. In this case, that wasn't necessarily true. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Michael Halloran : On the order side, the one thing that was useful was the composition by segment. Could you give a little context on the backlog as we exit the year in two respects? One, I'm guessing, Mike, that it meres [indiscernible] the comments that you just gave to Matt's question, but a little thought on the backlog as you look through the segments and also how to think about conversion of backlog into revenue? Mike Hilton : Yes. From an overall backlog standpoint, obviously the strongest change year-on-year is in the Advanced Tech segment and if you take out -- for a couple of reasons; one, most of the acquisitions fall into that. They're all falling to that segment, number one. Number two, on an organic basis, medical is strong, electronics is particularly strong. As you look at the other businesses, our Adhesives business was up, our Coating business was a little bit down and that's really more of a year-on-year comparison where the prior year we had some strong flip in Q4 and then Q1, some strong auto platform work that didn't repeat. I'd say in general, the biggest driver is the Advanced Tech segment, but the Adhesives piece is up as well. As we look to the first quarter, we expect all of the segments to be up, but again, the key driver is going to be the Advanced Tech piece. Michael Halloran : And the backlog conversion question? Mike Hilton : I'd say for this quarter coming forward, lowest of what we see in the backlog will get converted in the first quarter, but we do have some longer projects both in the Adhesives area, particularly the polymers and then some of the industrial coatings and even in some of the technology side where you have some orders to potentially push out. I'd say a good portion of that as you know converts within the quarter. Michael Halloran : That's sort of my guess. And then second question, obviously the seasonality on the Advanced Tech side is shifted around here. Your answer to previous question, quite some nice project activity, some electronics pieces that have moved in the quarter, some of the higher complexity items helping out. I know your visibility is limited on that side, but could you help provide how you're thinking about seasonality through fiscal '18? Are you expecting some seasonality to materialize in the fiscal second quarter that maybe would have materialized in the fiscal first quarter before ramping hard in the back half of the year? Something smoother than that now that you've got a larger piece of that portfolio being medical? Maybe just thoughts on the cadence. Mike Hilton : Yes, just a couple of comments there. I'd say the first quarter obviously is stronger than we would have expected at the year-end, but that's really linked to some of those large orders that we got. When you look at the second and third quarters going out, we had strong double-digit organic growth. There are going to be a little tougher comps year-over-year. So I think that will be the challenge that we're up against. I would say across the businesses and you start at the technology side of things, we are looking on a pro forma basis, medical being a sizable part of the portfolio now and that Advanced Tech piece, it's likely to be in that 30% range. So that's going to be something that's a little bit more stable and then I'd say if you look at the pieces, not electronic-related beyond medical is probably as much as another 20%. So that's also likely to be a bit more stable throughout the year and less seasonal. The electronics piece is the one that can vary, but I would say is this is the time of the year where we look at and work with our key customers on project activity and our project activity continues to be robust. I think the challenge will be that it's been a strong launch here by some of the mobile guys, but we're seeing a lot of interest in some of the newer technology, whether that's on the wafer side or whether that's on some of the things like flexible packaging side of things which is gaining share in the marketplace and has generally higher growth. We'd be figuring out that mix particularly in that segment against some stronger comps in the second or third quarter I think is the challenge. But that's the best insight we can provide at this point. Michael Halloran : Thanks for that. I appreciate the color. Congrats on a very nice quarter. Greg Thaxton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Trusz of Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Matthew Trusz : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on that, could you go through more detail and discuss the technology dynamics driving growth and electronics away from mobile and more on the chip and semi side? Mike Hilton : Yes. I'll make a couple of comments. On the semi side, we've historically done a lot on the packaging, but now we're seeing some customers that are looking at Advanced Technologies where they're actually stacking on the wafer as opposed to after the wafer is diced. And so ultimately that will proceed towards what's called through silicon via [ph]; so just think of that going vertical on the chip architecture and doing that on the wafer. That's a new application that has resulted in some nice growth for us over the last sort of 18 months. There are still potential additional customers that would adopt that particular approach and that's very sophisticated technology that we developed in concert with these customer applications. I'd say on the expense side, but also on the inspection side, a lot of the new products on the electronics side have enabled growth in a number of areas. On the packaging side, on the flexible packaging, rigid packaging and flexible packaging, in smaller packages to basically cram more in and allow for growth in the batteries, customers are starting to go to more flexible packages and that's something that our technology is enabling. And then I'd say if you look on a broader basis, right now, today, probably about 15% of Advanced Technology business goes into auto electronics and we see that as a longer term growth opportunity as you move towards more and more senses in equipment that would support eventually autonomous driving. We're doing a lot of development there. And then when you look at the non-electronics part in the Advanced Technologies space, with the medical piece, virtually all of the medical growth is coming from supporting new products and new applications for customers and that's the hallmark of our total company in all of our businesses, in our focuses around how do we create our own demand or whether that's in our Adhesives area, our Coatings area or in Advanced Technology area. That's really the focus and that's something we've been driving already relatively lower growth environment that we've seen over the last several years. Matthew Trusz : Great, thank you for the detail. Just to ask a follow-up on that. What's your sense of the penetration of these newer technologies into the supply chain and how many more years or portion of the market will need to adapt? Mike Hilton : I'd say it's early on, but it's hard to say for what I sense at all will be adapted. I think if you look at broader flex circuit technology, that's something that's growing through the high signal digits rates right now as basically some of the rigid circuit board gets converted over. On the wafer side, there are multiple ways to get at three-dimensional approach. It depends on which dimensions the customers take, but there's still some additional opportunity there. And then one area we haven't talked about yet is the other things that we offer on the electronics space, particularly test and inspection. Customers go to either three-dimensions or different approaches in process or technology. The inspection to this is becoming more critical particularly on the x-ray side of things and we've got a whole new set of products that are doing really well. And then our most recent acquisitions of the smaller [indiscernible] based companies were off to a good start as well and that's interconnect and ultimately three-dimension. So, we feel pretty good about that. It's also a lot about electronics, but that's the philosophy in terms of driving new product and new application growth, and as Greg said earlier, tiering what we try to do across all of our business. Greg Thaxton : Matt, this is Greg. I'll just add a high-level comment. A lot of the trends that Mike talked about translate into more sophisticated solutions for our customers, that they're dispensing smaller quantities in tighter, more difficult to reach spaces and the more sophisticated the application is, the more likely they're coming to Nordson for that solution provider. Matthew Trusz : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Stratton of Great Lakes. Your line is open. David Stratton : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one for me today; given the growth especially in ATS, can you talk a little bit about capacity where you stand as acquisitions? Have they been adding to capacities that you don't really need to expand? Or is there a potential to this growth to create some bottlenecks and impact your ability to meet demand in the near future? Mike Hilton : There's a lot in that question, but let me suggest that -- I'd say particularly on the electronics side, we've become a very adapted flexing up and down. We have our facilities across the world where we have capacity to flex up and down and we've also used our Nordson business systems to many cases, re-layout our factory to relatively low cost and capability. So I think we're very good there. I'd say with the medical business as an example, we have been through the acquisitions adding not only capacity but capability in the U.S. and outside the U.S. and we have been expanding. We built a new facility in Colorado; we've expanded our facility in Mexico with our latest acquisitions; we've got some additional capability and we're all centered in all the key areas where our customers are doing their development work. But then I'd say across all of our businesses, we've used a combination of our continuous improvement activity and increasing levels of upgrading of equipment and automation to not only make us more efficient, but to give us the capacity we need. So other than sort of normal maintenance capacity, we're in pretty good shape and with regard to our Palmers [ph] business, we're finishing up this year the transition in that business' consolidation. We're in pretty good shape from that standpoint. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc. Your line is open. Mike Hilton : Jeff? Jeffrey Hammond : Hey. Sorry about that. Mike Hilton : It's okay. Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : Good morning. Just maybe on the acquisitions, just I think you said they're on track, but anything notable in terms of opportunities that you're uncovering it on cost or revenue synergies early on? Mike Hilton : Well, I would say a couple of things. We've done a number of acquisitions and maybe I'll break them down and start with some of the smaller ones. Our smaller ones were two acquisitions in the electronics side that got us into a new area in the selective side of the space and our plan there is off to a good start, just as we did with the matrix inspection company which is the globalized local business. So we've seen some good success, I'd say in utilizing our global sales force to create new opportunities and start to close on some of those. I'd say with our plus back acquisition, we've added complement story as the product line and got us into a new area in animal health and I think we're seeing benefits from that and that gives us opportunities to optimize our EFT business there. I'd say Vention brought a lot of capability to us, in particular in the design and development space, which really allows us to get in early not only with critical larger established customers involved in their new product development, but also with some of the entrepreneurial new venture development companies there and we've been able to seize opportunities to pull through our broader product portfolio of products and I think longer term, there will be opportunities across some of these businesses to further optimize our supply chain and footprint. But I'd say in the short term, we're off to a good start; we've added capability in the case of medical side. We've added significant capability on the design front, I think just what customers are looking for and very helpful with [indiscernible] product portfolio through and it really came with some various established organization and people capability. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, great. And you mentioned active project inquiries, et cetera and Advanced Tech looking out past Q1. Can you speak to the same on what you're hearing from your customers on the Adhesive side? If we look a little further out just in terms of quoting and customer feedback, et cetera? Mike Hilton : Yes. I'd say on the adhesive side, it's a pretty skeptical [ph] of what we see. Just timing of things slowdown in most of the businesses for the holidays, but I'd say in terms of opportunities going forward, we think there's an opportunity for growth in all of our businesses. Some of them are more digital like our product assembly businesses and our palletizing businesses, but we're seeing typical activity and opportunity there. And for us in businesses like our traditional Adhesives business, we continue to benefit from both tiering. This year we got a lowered tier of non-woven set of customers all new to us based on complete design and built out of Shanghai and there are some growth opportunities there and then we've really used new product development to help recapitalize in that business and I'd say we've introduced some new technology to Asia for example on the palletizing side where we've gone with our underwater palletizers. We've started up the first facility in China, it's going well and we've got a lot of interest now relative to competing products. We feel good about with what the new technology is bringing. I'd say at this point in time, our visibility in some of these businesses in the short term, but I think the activity is typical of what we've expect to see at this point in time. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Thanks a lot, Mike. Mike Hilton : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Hey, good morning. Congrats on the organic and inorganic performance. Mike Hilton : Thanks, Chris. Christopher Glynn : Just wondering about capital allocation in the medium term; you've come some pretty robust activity there as the focus on continued execution on the pipeline relative to debt pay down? Or where does all that stand? Mike Hilton : I'd say our capital allocation is first and foremost supporting organic growth. I think Greg gave you some numbers on that and then second, around the dividend's piece, but both of those together are relatively mild. I think beyond that, we still have a short-term focus on debt reduction to free up capacity for opportunities and we will see opportunities out there in the targeted areas that we've mentioned. I think there are still probably the most opportunities in the medical side just because the market is more fragmented. But I'd say in the very short term, it continues to be around reducing debt to give us some free board opportunities through this year. So I'd say the priorities are pretty similar to where they've been after first quarter of last year. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then a modeling question on the corporate number. It spiked up a little bit in the quarter, but what's the best way to plug in for run rates there? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Chris. This is Greg. We had some -- call it 'unusual items' in the course -- and one time in the quarter and most of that increase over the prior year was associated with an initiative that we have in North America to move a portion of the business to a more shared service type of model. So I'd expect as we move into FY '18, we'll kind of normalize that to spend the amounts that you've seen in the most recent quarters. And then fourth quarter to trend down over time. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then my last one is on ADS. I just want to revisit if you can quantify the structural benefits from consolidation for fiscal '18 over '17? Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say it's going to be relatively modest because we'll have completed both the major progress we have under way, the one in North America where we're consolidating three facility into one and the one in Europe were going from two to one. It will get completed in the year, but for the first part of the year, we're still running multiple facilities as we transition equipment's and build out the new facilities. We're further ahead in the U.S. and the project in Europe started a little bit later. So I'd say there will be some modest impact in this year and some larger impacts in '19. Greg Thaxton : Yes. Chris, we'll probably firm that number up and give you some better guidance on that margin improvement within that segment as we're heading into '19. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Thanks, guys. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Hi, Walt. Walter Liptak : And congratulations, too. You talked about backlog and I think Jeff asked about it. He says I wonder if we could do the same thing on the coatings? It sounds like that one is probably maybe down even or probably growing the least. Any commentary on the first quarter on what you're seeing from projects over the next year? Mike Hilton : Yes. As I mentioned I think earlier, we do expect for all the businesses to be up in the first quarter. But we haven't seen I'd say some tough comps this fourth quarter and in the first quarter on the Coatings business, primarily on the auto side. If you look at our powder and liquid container, those businesses have grown nicely. We had some big auto platform work last fourth quarter that went through and some of that continued into the first quarter as the customers were going through model changes. We'd only anticipate significant model change kind of activity going through this year. But we do see a couple of areas that I think for the future would present good opportunities for growth in that business where we had some revenue and expect it to tick up over time. One we've talked about before in the sort of aerospace area as customers both the end customers and the Tier 1 suppliers look to do more automation. So I'd say we've had a lot of development work and some modest sales to date. We expect that to pick up over time. Another area that we're seeing more opportunity in is with electric vehicles. There is more work around the batteries themselves and we're seeing opportunities across the business, but most importantly in the Coatings area to support some of the things going on in the battery development. So we see opportunities there over time. I'd say the thing that's been a little bit of a drag this year, that issue being '17 has really been the auto piece of the platform. In the longer term we expect to see growth in that area. Walter Liptak : Okay. Thanks for that color and then if I could just ask -- I don't mean to beat the dead horse in the Advanced Tech, but I wonder if there's a way of delineating the traditional mobile phone makers versus China where it sounds like you've been maybe growing more rapidly as that market evolves. And then any difference in the growth rates there? And then with the new technologies, you talked about large projects, but I think this is the first time we're hearing that. I wonder if you could comment just on these test orders and then if the technologies work, there's more behind it as there's more features that go in with flexibles, or is this a short-term thing? Is there any visibility there? Mike Hilton : Yes. There's a lot of components there; maybe I'll just start at just the highest level and if you look at the mix of our business in Advance Tech today. So if you look at pro forma for '18, about 30% of our business is going to be medical. There's probably another close to 20% that would be industrial and other types of application. Then about half falls into that electronics space. Of that total Advance Tech, about 15 is directly mobile and then you got auto electronics as the similar side. Semiconductor is a little smaller and other consumer electronics are a little smaller, so that could be gaming consoles, LEDs, a variety of other things. So there's a breadth in the diversification, I'd say to the applications there across the whole segment that is different than it was if you just go back a couple of years primarily because of one, the medical piece and two, some of these other applications. So I'd say now in some of the newer applications that we've mentioned, the direction for most semiconductor makers is to go 3D, to go to three-dimensional chips. The question is whether you do that before or after you dice the wafer. The newest technology is going towards doing it on the wafer, but everybody is not following that app. We got some indications that others will be going in that direction, but it's not clear yet whether that's going to step up in a significant way, but those are typically larger opportunities, more sophisticated equipment. With regard to some of the other technologies that support the mobile side -- and I think if you look at the most recent phones, the biggest thing you see is battery. Everything is about battery, capacity and space, which means it squeezes everything else out and so some of the things that customers are working on is how do I cram in the capability in that reduced space and one of the ways to do that is to use more flexible circuits and we're certainly seeing outsize growth in the flexible circuits and that's an area where we've been successful in offering our technology both on dispense and on inspection side. Those are a couple of examples of things that we'll work on. There's a lot of other things that customers are working on. Now, you also ask about the Chinese mobile folks versus a more traditional. '17 has been a good launch year for the more traditional global players. We haven't heard as much from the Chinese players, but over time they have been growing, taking share particularly in China. So the opportunity for them is they continue to grow in China, do they grow beyond China and we expect to see further growth there and as we've mentioned in the past, they have now gone on the animation train and they're moving that way. It's still not far along as the global folks that we expect that trend to continue. So we have lots of projects for all of these folks -- which ones are going to go and what time is always difficult to judge. And I'd say in the other areas that are outside of the electronics space, we've got a lot of development work, particularly in the medical side that's robust. And then on the other businesses as well, this is typically the time of the year where we're working on particularly the newer technology-related projects. Walter Liptak : Okay, alright, I appreciate that color. Thanks, guys. Mike Hilton : Thanks, Walt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of SunTrust. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick [ph] standing in for Charlie. Thanks for taking my question. Mike Hilton : Hey, Patrick. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Looking at adhesive dispensing margin, I mean adjusted margins were 28%. Obviously very good. I just wanted to know what the mix of parts in consumables was for the segment and sort of looking out, what expectations you guys have in terms of adhesive margins expanding in '18 and beyond? Mike Hilton : I'd say Greg is looking up the parts number here. Typically, that's a segment where the parts are a little higher than our average might be closer to the middle 40s and the lower 40s, but we'll give you a heads up on that. But it's in that range. I'd say longer term from a margin's perspective for that segment; we'd like to get to the 30% level. Some of that will come from our normal continuous improvement using our business systems. Some of that will come from the restructuring that we're going through in the Palmer [ph] side of the business, but our longer term goal would be to get to that 30% level. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. As I wait for Greg on the consumables part. Mike Hilton : Yes, we may have to follow up and get back to you on that. It's not jumping off the page for us right now. Greg Thaxton : Patrick, I have that. Within Adhesives in the fourth quarter, our mix of parts was about 46% and in that, trending pretty closely to what it had been in prior quarters and as Mike mentioned, that tends to be pretty close to where the total company -- total company was about 48% in the fourth quarter. Now, that's up a bit from prior year, driven by a couple of things : one, general mix in the quarter as well as we've got the impact of the acquisitions in there that are more of a consumable, so they fall into that category. So that's lifting as well by a couple of percentage points, what the total mix otherwise would have been prior to those acquisitions timing their way in. That's going to primarily be in the Advanced Tech segment. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then I just want to go to Coatings for a second. Looking at the margins for the fourth quarter in '17, that seems to be lower than the previous three fourth quarters, I guess going back to '14. Is there anything that we should be looking at here or is it one of those items where we talked about volume being down in the bigger -- you guys had an impact on autos? Mike Hilton : Obviously there's some impact from the volume being down a little bit and then there's a little bit of mix effects there. There's nothing structurally changed there and that's something that we've been on a good path of improvement year-on-year for quite a while and I think we have continued opportunity to move up a little bit in that area; so nothing structurally going on there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's all right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Good morning. I just want to go back to Jeff's question in terms of customer or clients' thoughts into '18. As we stand today versus maybe a year ago, our customers are talking more optimistically about spending '18, or really no change at this point? Mike Hilton : I would say we haven't seen a significant change in terms of the dialog at this point. Obviously we have this potential for tax change here coming up. If that happens, I could see particularly some of our smaller mid-sized customers that might be an opportunity for further reinvestment. But I'd say the mood is encouraging. I think if you look at the year just from a macro standpoint, the U.S. is probably going to be a little better than we thought clearly Europe and Japan are stronger this year than most expected. So we've seen some good performance there, but I'd say in terms of project list in volumes, not a dramatic change in terms of customer attitude. Not a dramatic change for us. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Got it, thanks. And then I might have missed this, but could you talk about the growth rate that you're seeing medically? Are we still on that high single digit range at this point? Mike Hilton : Yes. We've had a good year, a double-digit year for us this year and I think that our high single to double-digit expectation for us and the long run there. There's a lot of trends that favor that and as we talked earlier, a lot of that is driven by new customer procedures, and approaches and products that we developed to support them and particularly with the drive towards minimally invasive procedures, we'd see that as a strong opportunity going forward. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: Great. Thank you. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We do have a follow-up question from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to -- you answered the question, Greg, about the shared services and the increased expense. Is this part of a bigger multi-quarter project to do more shared services where if that's true, were you in the project and is there going to be some savings from it? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Walter, that phase is part of our ongoing drive to improve overall performance, to drive how we can approach the business from a more efficient way and you could go back several years prior to acquisitions and suggest that in parts of the world, we had been executing under this model, but with acquisitions over the last several years, this is an effort to really kind of bring more of the businesses under this type of model. So we're starting first in North America. We're largely into that effort. We'll complete that let's say in most of that in the first half or so of FY '18 and then we will look to other parts of the world where it makes sense then to integrate some of the businesses that are not in some of the established locations where we had shared services. So I do expect that this will continue. I wouldn't suggest that I see this as being a significant expense to be modeled in once we get through the '18 effort here. Mike Hilton : And I'd say Walt, the biggest benefit that we see is really -- there was a question earlier about capacity and capacity to support growth. For us the biggest benefit here is to have a platform that's going to allow us to scale across effectively and as Greg said, to integrate with some of the acquisitions more efficiently and there has been a fair bit of work that we needed to do upfront around process and systems and we're in the phase now starting to stand up the North American Organizations. Again, I think the benefits we'll see are sort of the longer term and our ability to scale more effectively and efficiently. Walter Liptak : Okay. Where is the shared services going to be? In one location? Mike Hilton : Yes. For the U.S., it's going to be in Ohio. In Europe and Asia today, we have I'd say partial shared services in different places as Greg was mentioning. But for the U.S., it's going to be in Ohio. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. All right. Thank you. Greg Thaxton : In an existing facility. Mike Hilton : Yes, at an existing facility that we're refitting. Walter Liptak : Okay, thank you. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mike Hilton for any closing remarks. Mike Hilton : First of all, I'd like to thank everybody for participating and I'd like to once again thank our global team for doing an outstanding job this year of meeting our customers' needs in a very effective way and allowing us to deliver outstanding results. With that I'd just say happy holidays to everyone. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Nordson Corporation Conference Call today, Friday, February 23, 2018, to report Fiscal Year 2018 First Quarter Results and Fiscal Year 2018 Second Quarter Outlook. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on Nordson's webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until March 9, 2018, which can be accessed by dialing (404) 537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 4186237. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding future performance based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After remarks on the quarter, there will be a question-and-answer session. With that being said, I would like to introduce Mike Hilton, President and Chief Executive Officer of Nordson Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's 2018 first quarter conference call. I'm joined by Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'm very pleased to report that Nordson's outstanding global team has once again delivered record results. We successfully leveraged increased sales volume to drive improvement in operating margin, diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA, as compared to the first quarter a year-ago. Our technology leadership, excellence in customer service, and diversification efforts have helped drive this growth. During the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Sonoscan as well as certain assets from Infiniti Dosing. I would like to extend a warm welcome to these employees that have recently joined Nordson; we're looking forward to expanding our capabilities with these great additions to the portfolio in the coming months. I will now provide some highlights on our financial performance and Greg will offer more detailed commentary in a few moments. Looking at the first quarter, sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA, were all first quarter records. We generated strong top-line against a very challenging prior year comparison where total company organic growth was 10%. Demand was robust in most all of our product lines and was largely driven by continued strong demand within electronics and medical end markets. We remain committed to delivering the best technology solutions, while employing continuous improvement initiatives to drive bottom-line results. Excluding one-time charges of $2 million and the incremental $6 million of intangible asset amortization expense in the current year's first quarter, adjusted operating margin was 23% in the current quarter, up 420 basis points over the prior year. EBITDA increased 49% in the quarter and EBITDA margin improved 250 basis points both as compared to the same period a year ago, representing very strong first quarter performance. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are expecting organic sales growth to be more modest as we're up against challenging comparisons to the prior year where organic sales growth was 9%. I'll speak more about the outlook in a few moments, but first I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed perspective on the first quarter and our second quarter guidance. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'll first provide some comments on our first quarter results before moving on to our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. First quarter sales were $550 million, an increase of 35% over the prior year's first quarter. This change in sales included approximately 19% growth in organic volume, approximately 12% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions, and approximately 5% increase related to the favorable effect of currency translation compared to the prior year's first quarter. Organic sales growth was at the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by strong demand in electronics and medical end markets. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, general product assembly, rigid packaging, and non-woven's product lines drove this segment's growth in the quarter, offset by softness in the polymer processing product lines. Japan and Asia were strongest regionally. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, the 83% sales volume growth over the prior year first quarter included 50% organic volume growth and 33% growth related to the first year effective acquisitions. This is very strong performance particularly considering the difficult comparisons to the prior year first quarter where organic growth for this segment was 23%. Although electronic end markets were the strongest, all product lines and geographies generated organic growth in the quarter. This segment's acquisitive growth includes the fiscal 2017 acquisitions of ACE, InterSelect, Plas-Pak, and Vention, and one month of the fiscal 2018 acquisition of Sonoscan, which as Mike noted, we added to do portfolio in January. Within the Industrial Coating segment, powder, container, and liquid finishing product lines drove this quarter's organic sales growth, geographically Europe, Japan, and Asia were the strongest. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 55% in the quarter and operating profit improved 55% to $118 million as compared to the prior year's first quarter, with reported operating margin of 21% in the current quarter. As Mike noted, the quarter's results include approximately $6 million of incremental intangible asset amortization expense as compared to the prior year which dilutes operating margin by more than 100 basis points. Excluding the $2 million of one-time charges in the quarter, and the $6 million of the incremental amortization expense, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 23% which compares to 19% for the prior year first quarter. On a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 24% in the quarter or 25% when excluding one-time restructuring charges in the quarter of $1 million related to U.S. facility consolidation efforts. The dilution from the prior year's first quarter's 26% operating margin primarily relates to the inefficiencies of working through the U.S. facility consolidation. Within the Advanced Technology System segment, reported operating margin was 25% in the first quarter or 27% when excluding the $6 million of the incremental intangible asset amortization expense, and $1 million of short-term purchase accounting charges related to the step-up in value of Sonoscan acquired inventory. This 900 basis point improvement over prior year's first quarter margin of 18% is driven primarily by volume leverage. Industrial Coating segment reported operating margin of 18% in the first quarter, is up 450 basis points from the prior year due to product mix and volume leverage. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $105 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.78, a 107% increase over the prior year GAAP diluted earnings per share. The $6 million of incremental intangible asset amortization charges reduced EPS by $0.08 per diluted share, and previously mentioned charges of $1 million for short-term purchase accounting related to the step-up and value of acquired inventory, and the $1 million of non-recurring restructuring charges reduced EPS by $0.02 per diluted share. As a result of U.S. Federal Income Tax Reform legislation passed in 2017, a one-time discrete tax benefit of $22 million or $0.37 per diluted share was recognized in the quarter. This includes an estimated benefit of $45 million related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities and an estimated charge of $23 million for the transition tax on deemed unrepatriated foreign earnings. Additionally, a tax benefit of $5 million or $0.08 per diluted share was recognized in the quarter related to the adoption of new accounting standard requiring excess tax benefits related to share-based payment transactions to be credit to income tax expense rather than equity. A reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share is included in the financial exhibits of our press release. We delivered strong first quarter EBITDA of $141 million, a 49% increase over the prior year first quarter, and EBITDA margin improved 250 basis points to 26% as compared to prior year's first quarter. From a balance sheet perspective net debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA inclusive of acquired EBITDA was 2.2 times at the end of the first quarter. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends, and adjusted free cash flow before dividends, as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. I'll now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Prior year's second quarter organic growth was 9%. So we're up against challenging comparisons again. We are forecasting sales to increase in the range of 9% to 13% as compared to the second quarter a year ago. This outlook includes organic volume to be in the range of down 3% to up 1%, 7% growth from the first year effective acquisitions, and a positive currency effect of 5% based on the current exchange rate environment as compared to the prior year. At the mid-point of this outlook, we expect second quarter gross margin to be about 55% and operating margin to be approximately 22% or 23% excluding $6 million of incremental asset intangible amortization expense as compared to the prior year. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $11 million and an effective tax rate of 25%, for second quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.33 to $1.47 per diluted share. This earnings per share range is inclusive of $0.08 per diluted share of incremental intangible asset amortization expense as compared to the prior year. With forecasted depreciation and amortization expense of about $28 million in the quarter, we expect EBITDA to be in the range of $143 million to $154 million, up 21% at the mid-point over the prior year. I'll add a few additional comments relative to our forecasted tax rate that may be helpful for modeling purposes. Our forecasted effective tax rate for the second quarter and full-year based on lower U.S. corporate tax rate and our jurisdictional mix of income is 25%. At this time, we estimate our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate to be between 22% and 23% based on current tax laws. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Again I'd like to thank our global team for delivering these strong results. Our second quarter guidance reflects more modest sales growth as compared to the prior year's challenging second quarter growth. Our strategic priorities and capital deployment objectives remain consistent. We'll continue to focus our efforts on technology leadership, product tiering new applications, and market penetration to drive growth over the long-term. We will continue to leverage the tools within the Nordson business system to drive operating efficiencies across the organization and we'll continue to see high quality companies that fit our targeted spaces will help us achieve long-term growth and profitability. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is open. Charlie Brady : Mike, can you just talk about the commentary about in Adhesive Dispensing the inefficiencies from that facility consolidation? Can you comment on kind of the impact in that quarter, is that done now at the end of the first quarter or is that continuing into 2Q? Mike Hilton : Yes. So as you recall, we've laid out a plan to consolidate three facilities into one and to finish that consolidation by the end of this fiscal year. At the moment, we have four facilities running because we are transitioning equipment and capability between those three and the new facility. So I'd say the biggest impact is probably in this quarter, but we'll see some continued impact as we systematically close those remaining three facilities, but it's not all going to happen at once, but it is happening according to plan and we will be through that by the end of this fiscal year. Charlie Brady : Would you expect the EBIT margin impact in Q2 to be at a similar impact to Q1? Greg Thaxton : Charlie this is Greg. I would say it'll be a similar impact in Q2. Generally we expect that impact to kind of scale down as we get into the back half of the year but if we're looking at Q2, it's probably going to be a similar impact. Charlie Brady : Okay. And can you remind us -- Mike Hilton : Let me just make one more comment, Charlie. Charlie Brady : Sorry. Mike Hilton : As we look to next year obviously we will have the facilities consolidated, we won't have the duplication of costs and as part of this facility consolidation. We've also invested in new equipments which should add some efficiencies, so we should see some benefits into 2019. Charlie Brady : Thanks, that's helpful. Hey, on Advanced Tech, can you remind us what the current mix of the non-electronics piece is right now and kind of how you think that shapes out for the year? Mike Hilton : Yes. If you look at it for the year we're probably looking at about 30% that falls into the medical category, about 20% that falls into non-electronic sort of general industries, and the rest falls into electronics with typically around 15%, 20% that will be sort of mobile phone, another 15% or 20% or so that would be into kind of like automotive electronics and then the rest would be across semiconductor and a variety of other applications. Greg Thaxton : So we're looking at about half of that being non-electronic, half of that segment being non-electronics related. Charlie Brady : Great, thanks. I'll hop back in the queue. Appreciate it. Mike Hilton : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Could you just talk about the backlog trends by segment as you work through the quarter and what's the thought process is when you look at the second quarter, how growth should track across the three businesses? Mike Hilton : Yes. At a high level we had a pretty nice backlog, I think up about 9%. Order rates were positive as well. What we look at though is what equipment is going to be delivered in the quarter and so some of the backlog is not going to be delivered in the quarter. And then, when we look at year-on-year comparisons, second quarter and third quarter, very strong for us. So we're in that period of time where the order rate comparisons gets a little bit more challenging. So our guidance really reflects what we think is going to be delivered in the quarter in general and then what we think the outlooks against the comparison. I'd say at high level, if we look at the expectations for the businesses and maybe I\u2019ll give you a little bit better feel for the year as opposed to just quarter-to-quarter because as you know we have projects that can go in and out, and we have the seasonal -- seasonality. But if we look at what we expect for the year, we expect this to be another growth year for the company. We expect virtually all of the product lines to be up. The one challenge there will be particularly our dispense systems in the electronics area which are most linked to the mobile phone kind of business and having such a tremendous year. Last year that's going to be a challenge. Our hope is that the other general industries activities and the medical business will offset that. Mike Halloran : So when I think about on a forward basis here obviously really impressive electrical onboarding this quarter. What's the thought process moving forward in terms of how is the pipeline look with -- what are the customers are saying out there, I mean is there a pause against these really difficult comparisons or is the thought process you can be able to maintain this high level even if there's not a lot of growth, but at least maintain the pace of revenue as it sits here today? Mike Hilton : So if you look across the total segment, as I said, I think we're expecting that the other parts of business, the non-electronic parts of the business, particularly the non-dispense part of the businesses will help offset which will be what is a challenge year-on-year. That said, if you look at the particular parts of the business, our inspection business is strong, our service treatment business is strong, the new acquisitions are doing well. The dispense business had a strong first quarter but it's going to be challenged the rest of the year just because of the significant business we did last year and the change. On long run, we still expect things to be strong in the electronics segment. Now this is the time of the year that we typically meet with all of the potential innovators in the business and we have lots of projects going with them. The challenge is we don't know which ones of those are going to go forward and what the impact is going to be. But our focus has been to take advantage of whatever growth comes out of that to be flexible, but also to continue to drive the diversification of the business. So to drive medical, to drive the non-electronics piece, and we're seeing good traction there. Mike Halloran : And then just on the price cost side and the inflationary side, it seems like you guys are in a good spot. But just want to hear how you guys are -- what are you seeing from an inflationary perspective within your portfolio or the supply chain and how you're feeling about it relative to your own financials? Mike Hilton : So I'd say, we're -- you're seeing some movement in some commodity materials. I think we do a pretty good job in our global sourcing activity of mitigating that impact, and as we continue to innovate with new products, we're able to offset any push there. So we don't see that as a big concern for us. Mike Halloran : Anything on the labor side? Mike Hilton : I think we're seeing the typical kind of increases year-on-year and most of those hit in the first -- the first quarter. And at the end of the day our focus is to take all the skilled people that we have and leverage that through our business systems to increase and drive productivity, I think we've done a good job there as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Trusz from Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Matt Trusz : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Mike Hilton : Yes, good morning, Matt. Matt Trusz : Can you provide some additional granularity on how that non-polymers pieces of ADS performed from an end market perspective and just overall how do you see customer spending levels in 2018 and from the Tax Act you think that there will be any impact on their CapEx plans? Mike Hilton : Yes, if you look at our sort of non-polymer part of the business, packaging tends to be largely linked with the consumer product side of things, it continues to grow, many of our customers are challenged with growth, but there's a lot of focus on productivity and improvement which helps us, plus we continue to drive new applications and recapitalization through technology. So that's been solid. I would say our non-woven's business, the diaper and other related products has been solid. Product assembly can be a little here but we expect that over the year to be solid. And if you look at the underlying drivers of growth, a lot of that links to middle class, improvement in middle class, consumption-related activities we expect to see that continue to be strong. I'd say as a direct effect of the Tax Act, I think people are still trying to sort that out and figure out what that means to the extent that we would see an uptick in investment in the U.S. that would be encouraging for us. And as I mentioned, a lot of our businesses where customers looking at productivity improvement falls into a sweet spot. And I'd say in a broader note talking just about the polymer part of the business, we're seeing nice improvement in order entry across all those product lines, so that's encouraging as well. Matt Trusz : Great, thanks. And then turning to polymers, are you seeing elements of softness in the end markets facing that business? Or you encountering company specific type of challenges, it would be great to have more color either way? Mike Hilton : It's really neither. We have parts of the business that are bigger order intake particularly the pelletizing part of the business and that can be lumpy. And so we're really just looking at a year-on-year comparison where we had a big order in the first quarter last year and didn't have a similar big order this year. Yet if I look at order rates they're up nicely across all of the product lines there. So not a concern that we have just timing and that that like product assembly and some of our electronics business can be lumpy at times and year-over-year doesn't always line up, but if you look at year-to-year, we expect to see improvement. Matt Trusz : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : So just back on the mobile phone customer base, you said this is the time of the year, you're starting to see projects, are they coming in with fewer projects or are they indicating to you that they're going to do less this year or is it still pretty robust? Mike Hilton : I would say, kind of from November through now is when that project activity is underway. I'd say the activity is pretty robust. We're not clear though in any one year which ones are going to go forward. I think it's prudent to be a little bit cautious just given the magnitude of sort of phone changes that occurred in our customer base last year. But I'd say it will be clear in the next couple of months which ones of these are going to go forward and have an impact. At this point, it\u2019s going to be tough to offset the really, really strong year we had last year even if you know a reasonable amount of those projects go forward and that's kind of the expectation we have. But outside of the phone business, if you look at auto electronics, some of the other markets, some of the new technologies like flexible circuits which are going into a lot of different things, we're seeing a nice demand there. And we continue to introduce new products that are getting traction. But last year was a particularly strong year because of all of the innovation around the new phones introduced. Jeff Hammond : And what are you seeing from the China handset OEMs? Mike Hilton : We're seeing good, I'd say good activity. We're working again with them on projects as well. I'd say well we're in that period of time where we expect to see orders come in. It'll be interesting to see what degree of innovation comes through in their new phone offerings, which will probably be a little bit later this year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then in the guidance you mentioned project timing, I guess stuff in the backlog that's pushing out and into future quarters; is that -- are you seeing a greater component or backlog that's pushing out the normal or is that just kind of normal timing you have some longer cycle projects? Mike Hilton : Yes. I don't think it's anything unusual. I mean if you look at the projects that tend to be longer that are in our polymer area, that are in our product assembly, some of our orders in other parts of the businesses are released in tranches. And so it's -- I'd say it's nothing particularly unusual, we're just trying to give you the best commentary we can here and give you the best transparency we can. Jeff Hammond : Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot, Mike. Mike Hilton : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Just going back to the ATS and I guess this is more than middle handset, Nordson has been fairly successful obviously with diversifying the customer base, gaining some share. I know you mentioned the model numbers, model change might not be as significant this year, but is there opportunity outside of that for you guys to maybe further diversify that customer base, gain greater share, just any thoughts on that? Mike Hilton : Yes, absolutely. So I mean what -- there are certain end markets that are growing nicely that become sizable. So we talk about auto electronics is one that will continue to grow not just this year, but in the long run, and we have specific offerings that are getting traction there. We've talked about in the past on the semiconductor side, doing both dispense and inspection at there. And we started to see more customers interested in both the most sophisticated dispense applications that relates to some of their process changes as well as the inspection both on the X-ray side of things as well as more sophisticated bond testing equipment. And so those are applications I'd say and opportunities within the electronics space that really not necessarily tied to the phone systems that are encouraging for us. And then, we talked about sort of the Chinese suppliers on the phone side who are continuing to make good traction there. So the diversification effort within electronics continues both on a customer and application basis and we continue to introduce new technologies it's getting good traction but beyond that we're also trying to drive growth. So, for example, we acquired Plas-Pak last year. They had a segment that we didn't participate in which was animal health and we're seeing some nice growth there. And then of course in the medical we largely expanded that, we're seeing good growth in the medical side of the business. So within and outside the electronics piece, we're trying to continue to drive that diversification. Greg Thaxton : And Allison, this is Greg. I would add beyond that some of the other acquisitions that we've done in the electronics space, so some of the flex coding dispensing acquisitions, the Sonoscan acquisition, those also will allow us to gain share in spaces that we haven't participated in before. Allison Poliniak : That's great. And then just going back to the commentary around potential acceleration from the Tax Reform in terms of investment, I understand obviously folks are still kind of working through all that, but if we do get a sense of I guess sort of the figure turns on in terms of that investment maybe in the next three months. How quickly I guess going back to historical, would you recognize that, would this be more of 2019 event for you potentially? Mike Hilton : It depends a little bit in terms of what part of the business is -- that's related to. So if its consumer product related businesses that could be quicker because likely those will be line upgrades or things like that that could happen sooner. If it's something like platform investment in the automobile side that's probably going to be a longer-term kind of activity, so it depends on the nature of what that investment would look like. If it's a whole new facilities that folks are starting up, they're probably not going to make that happen in the next six to nine months. So it depends a little bit on the nature of what that investment is. If it's ramp up because consumers are benefiting from tax relief as well and looking to spend some of that initial money in the sort of capacity that could be quicker. Greg Thaxton : Yes, I'd suggest that as Mike mentioned it's really about the scope of the project on our customers and as opposed to our ability to deliver our product within a short timeframe. We could do that, it's how big is the scope of the project for the customer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : First, in Adhesives, just back to some of questions that were asked earlier. Can you get a little more specific, Greg, in terms of what the absolute impact will be from these inefficiencies this year; is it a $3 million impact, a $10 million impact, somewhere in between, can you just help quantify that? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Matt, I would say as I provided in my comments, if you look excluding the one-time charge at the dilution, you get back to prior year without those inefficiencies. And so that helps you quantify that. And as we mentioned, we will probably have that similar drag in Q2, and then as we get into the back half that dissipates somewhat and then we're past that by the end of fiscal 2018. Matt Summerville : So if you think about this business, is there anything you're seeing demand or otherwise that leads you to think once you get beyond this facility rationalization consolidation, you start to see those efficiencies, is there any reason that this cannot get back to a 30% plus operating margin business over the next 12 to maybe 24 -- maybe 24 months is a better number than 12? Greg Thaxton : Yes, if you look at the total, if you look at the total segment, yes, I think that's certainly as we've talked that's our overall goal is to get back to the 30%. So I'd say just to tell you what we're doing, we're going from three facilities to one, but in that we've incorporated new technology that will allow us to get more efficiencies, but also additional capacity and we're also working in parallel, a consolidation in Europe from two facilities to one which will also be done by the end of this year. So we'll have around the globe, the most the latest technology, most efficient facility, so that will help in this area. And then when you look at the total segment, our aspiration would be to get to that 30% level. As you said, it may not be next year, but our aspiration would be to get there and we think we see a path to do that. Matt Summerville : And then just back to the events-type business of 50% organic in the quarter, can you help parse that or give a bit more granularity with mobile half of that increase or all the increase with medical a quarter up, can you give some sort of weighting to how you would chop up that 50%? Greg Thaxton : Yes. I would say, if you look at all of this stuff, other than the key dispense parts of the business, it was up nicely double-digits. The dispense was really linked to -- we had some big orders come in, linked to particularly flex circuit technology. So there's a new application in Flex circuits that's getting traction across all of the mobile platforms and then some others. And we-re very well-positioned with our technology to take advantage of that and we had some sizable orders come in and that was the biggest single driver. Now beyond that, we also saw nice growth in all of our inspection business as well, but we had some -- couple of big projects that came in that are really linked to technology moving from rigid to flex circuits of us being well-positioned with our capability around the globe and our product performance take advantage of that. Matt Summerville : Longer-term Mike, if you look may be beyond the next couple of quarters in the funnel, the conversations you're having with customers whether it'd be things like 3D stacking, whether it'd be things like moving from rigid to flexible circuitry, are there are other opportunities in the funnel, if you want to call it a funnel that can be substantial like what you saw in fiscal Q1? Mike Hilton : I'd tell you in one quarter that's a pretty big increase. I wouldn't put things in that. I'd say high level trends. Number one auto electronics is just going to continue to grow. I mean we're not to self-driving vehicles yet and it's continuing to grow and to get to there, if you believe we're going to get there it's even more. I'd say number two, trying to do more on wafers prior to dicing is likely to continue to grow as other customers look to adopt that kind of technology because of the benefits that come with it and that's both a dispense and inspection opportunity for us. And then, in our inspection business, as Greg talked about a little bit, we've bought some smaller companies that have regional positions and we've had a lot of success with things like MatriX, and now Select, and that we expect it with Sonoscan as well, globalizing those businesses more effectively, so that we're in fact growing our global position, so those are some of the things that make sense. I mean we have wafer level offerings and bond testing now based on where customers are going that we haven't had before. And these are significantly larger higher priced items. So I think there's some growth opportunities there based on where the technology is heading. There are other projects that the folks are working on; we really can't talk about the nature of those, but the ones I've highlighted I think are good trends for us. Greg Thaxton : And, Matt, this is Greg. I'd add kind of high level in with that topic is and this has been a good driver for us for several years now is the demand for those end markets continue to require more precision, tighter spaces for dispense, faster demands for both dispense or the TNI. And those trends and those changes that take place in those end markets are good for us and oftentimes we're in a limited group or perhaps the only supplier of that can deliver the needs that they have from a manufacturing perspective. So high level the trends in those end markets continue to be in our favor. Mike Hilton : I would also like to focus that across all of our businesses, technology plays a critical role. We're introducing new technology everywhere to drive growth. We haven't talked about core adhesives all that much, but we talk a little bit last year about some of our newer non-woven technologies targeting completely new set of customers through a tearing approach. We have some new applications that get into supporting makers of the athletic wear that look like there's some promise. So across all of our businesses we're looking for either applications or product opportunities really to create, as we kind of monitored the last couple of years is how do we create our own growth. I think should the economies continue to improve likely they have last year and hopefully this year and obviously we will float on top of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask about the acquisitions Infiniti Dosing and Sonoscan, I wonder if we can get some details looks like they're small, but if we can get may be of how much cash outflow, how much the prices on them and their revenue contribution? Mike Hilton : Yes, so in Infiniti was pretty modest, Walt. That's -- I'd say capability in a particular pumping operation that we add to our portfolio will be part of Simtech business. That's relatively modest in terms of a few million dollars. The Sonoscan is little bit more significant than that, probably similar in size to previous acquisitions like MatriX where we expect to grow nicely and will be tens of millions of dollars of revenue for us going forward. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. And with these two deals happening at the beginning of the year, was it just coincident timing or was it once the tax reform went through, you were able to get the deals going and any thoughts on M&A for the rest of the year now that the tax reform's done? Mike Hilton : Sure. So Walt, I would say these particular ones are ones that we're in the pipeline that we've been working. We have a nice pipeline of opportunities that we continue to work these two just happens to come forward in the first quarter. I would say our priorities maybe a high level question our priorities and capital deployment remain the same, support organic growth, and that includes some of these initiatives we talked about. We'd like to keep up our dividend strategy as we've discussed. We have modest offsets for share dilution although we didn't do much last year. And then, M&A would be a priority. We have a good pipeline of M&A opportunities and our focus last year and continuing through the first part of this year has been to reduce our leverage, so that we have the capacity to move quickly should opportunities come forward, and so that's probably going to continue for certainly the next couple of quarters as we continue to de-lever the capacity there going forward. Walter Liptak : Okay. With that comment about the good pipeline, is it activity on M&A picking up or you're seeing more businesses come to the marketplace or is it fairly steady with what you saw in the last couple of years? Mike Hilton : I'd say it's fairly steady. I mean these things you never can time sometimes you work in years on projects to get them to come to fruition, so you can never really time them. I'd say we probably still see the most activity in the medical -- in the medical space but they're smaller properties like these tuck-ins that we've done to support our Advanced Tech or EFT business as well. So we see -- I\u2019d say a similar type of pipeline as we had before and we just want to be prepared should something of significance come forward we need to act on. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Liam Burke from B. Riley FBR. Your line is open. Liam Burke : Mike, you touched on it briefly on one of the previous questions on the tiering being one of the contributors of the growth there. How is that -- is it continuing to develop the way you want and are you seeing any competitive responses there? Mike Hilton : I'd say it is continuing the way we want. The one reference, specific net reference I was making had to do with some new products that we developed in China or emerging markets outside of China, so a lower tier non-woven set of customers. I think last year that we had about 60 or 70 new customers that we've never had before. So going a little further down on the pyramid still with good profitability and we're continuing to see traction there. And then I'd say another area where we're seeing some good traction is in the electronics space, particularly a lot of the automotive from formal coating type applications or a tiered -- or a tiered product and we have tiered products as well for the mobile side of the house. So yes, I'd say it's playing out the way we\u2019ve expected. I think we've been pretty successful. We do have competitors. So but I don't see any significant change there I think it's a combination of having the right offering and then having the full team from the applications team through the supply chain to just secure it and then the service after the sale on all these businesses is critical. So I think that model continues to work and we continue to look for opportunities where we can further tier our various businesses. Liam Burke : Great, thanks Mike. And Greg, on the consumables was the percentage contribution to revenue within the normal range? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Liam, I'd say it's up closer to the high 40% now. As you think about some of the acquisitions we've completed particularly the Vention acquisition which is a consumable product, so running total company more in that 47%, 48% range. Liam Burke : It\u2019s great. Thank you, Greg. Thank you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Stratton from Great Lakes Review. Your line is open. David Stratton : When looking at your balance sheet, I know that the majority is variable rate debt and given the recent rise in interest rates that we're seeing, can you just kind of give us your thoughts on how you see your capital structure going forward and if there's a plan to maybe shift to more fixed rate or just what are your thoughts on that? Greg Thaxton : Yes, generally, David, we're always looking at the appropriate mix of that capital structure we'll be taking a look at that coming up as our revolver is coming to maturity, but we tend to keep a pretty balanced, kind of, across the cycle level of both fixed and floating to kind of allow us to be prepared to manage the business appropriately. So we'll focus on that, but it will be a balanced, probably similar to historical trends. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady from SunTrust. Your line is open. Charlie Brady : Hey thanks. Just want to follow-up on Industrial Coating systems and the margin performance there, pretty strong performance for a first quarter which tends to be the lowest quarter and in general you have a pretty big step-up into Q2, is there some timing that's going on there that would change that normal seasonality or what's driving that strong margin performance in Q1? Mike Hilton : Well, you know, for a long time, we've had a continued focus on that business improving the profitability and the team has done a nice job of doing that. I\u2019d say year-over-year comparisons are probably a little bit more a mix of business than anything else. We did have -- the revenue was up which is helpful from a volume leverage standpoint and then we probably had a little bit better beneficial mix of business year-over-year. But the trends continue to improve in that business and the team is very focused on that, but they're at very nice level given the scope of what they supply. Charlie Brady : Would you expect the typical revenue kind of -- revenue seasonality, I guess throughout the years you've seen typically? Mike Hilton : You're talking about that business or in total? Charlie Brady : About IC. I mean I guess what I'm trying to get to, was there some pull-forward that would just skew the 1Q results higher than the normal seasonality would indicate and therefore we've got some pull-forwards in the rest of the year or it was just a great quarter and the rest of the year kind of continues with the same pattern you'd normally see? Mike Hilton : Yes. I wouldn't say there was a significant pull-forward there, no. And we would expect similar pattern where the second half of the year is typically stronger than the first half of the year from a volume perspective. In that business, we've got a variety of different product lines, so the mix can have effect year-on-year, and I think most of what you're seeing here is a little bit of volume leverage and a mix effect year-over-year. Greg Thaxton : But Charlie back to a comment Mike made earlier, this is -- this segment as well as the other segments, we continue to focus on those continuous improvement initiatives and believe that generally across the board we can continue to raise margins everything else being equal from period to period. There's improvement opportunity across the business. Charlie Brady : So just on that Greg because this is a business that one point if you got to 12% EBITDA margin was going to be a Home Run, a few years back we're high-teens right now. I guess our thinking kind of been we're kind of top end of the range, kind of 17%, 18% EBIT margin not much more there, it sounds like that's not really the correct way to look at it and maybe you guys see a little more upside over the next two or three years beyond that level; is that correct? Greg Thaxton : Yes, I think what our goal going back five or six years ago was at the high end -- this is a cyclical business, right, so at the high end of the cycle we got to be approaching 20%. And obviously we will be lower than that if we're at the low end of the cycle. But still our aspiration is still get to that 20% level and I think the team has done a great job, it's not easy to get there when you think about the scope of what we do because of all the things that we buy in as being largely the OEM in that particular space. But we're very focused on improving that. And I\u2019d say from a company level, we talked about moving to a global sort of shared service approach to help us scale and grow more effectively and integrate things more effectively and we're in the beginning of that process as well. We're looking to standup our North American service center in the May/June timeframe this year and then move to Europe and then move to Asia. So we're doing some other things to help leverage going forward in the short-term that probably adds some additional cost but in the long run that will be a benefit. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference call back over to Mike Hilton for any closing remarks. Mike Hilton : So thanks everyone for all of the questions and interest this quarter. I'd also like to put a big thank you out to our global team who continues to exceed my expectations. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions for how to participate will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Jimmy. Good morning. We are pleased to welcome you to Nordson Corporation\u2019s conference call today, Tuesday, May 22, 2018, to report financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2018 as well as our third quarter outlook for fiscal year 2018. My name is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications for Nordson. I\u2019m here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. Our conference is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until June 5, 2018, which can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 3797796. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the Company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Lara, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s 2018 second quarter conference call. We delivered a record second quarter on many metrics, and I\u2019d like to commend our dedicated global team for their commitment and focus. The resilient performance of our base business coupled with the strategic fit of our recent acquisitions led to improvement in operating profit, diluted earnings per share, and EBITDA as compared to the second quarter a year ago. Our sustained focus on continuous improvement initiatives, product tiering, and providing the best technology solutions, drove solid bottom line performance. I\u2019ll now provide some highlights on our financial results and Greg will offer more detailed commentary in a few moments. Looking at the second quarter, sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and EBITDA were all second quarter records. These are impressive results against very challenging comparison, where each segment delivered strong organic growth last year and total Company organic sales growth was 9% in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Each segment delivered strong operating margin in the current quarter, where excluding one-time charges and the incremental $4 million of intangible asset amortization expense in the current year\u2019s second quarter, total Company adjusted operating margin was 24% and adjusted EBITDA margin improved over 100 basis points as compared to the same period a year ago, reaching 29% in the current quarter, highlighting our solid second quarter performance. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we face very challenging comparisons to the prior year\u2019s third quarter, where each segment delivered strong organic growth and the total Company organic sales growth was 11%. I\u2019ll speak more about our outlook in a few moments, but I\u2019ll first turn the call over to Greg, to provide a more detailed perspective on the second quarter and our third quarter guidance. Greg? Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll first provide some comments on our second quarter results, before moving on to our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Second quarter sales increased 12% over the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Inclusive of a decrease of approximately 1% in organic volume, approximately 7% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions and approximately 5% increase related to the favorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Organic sales volume was in line with our expectations, coming in at the midpoint of our guidance range as we expected moderation against last year\u2019s results, particularly in the Advanced Technology Systems segment where prior year organic growth was 18%. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, organic volume was down about 2% against 5% organic growth in last year\u2019s second quarter. Our end market demand remains relatively strong and we expect this segment to grow organically in the second half of the year. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, organic volume was down 1% as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter organic growth of 18%. Although we did see growth in certain product lines, expected moderation in the quarter impacted performance. Prior year growth included very strong performance in both electronic systems and fluid management end markets. This segment\u2019s acquisitive growth in the current quarter includes a partial month of 2017 InterSelect GmbH acquisition, two months of the 2017 acquisition of Vention and the 2018 acquisition of Sonoscan. Within the Industrial Coating segment, powder and container product lines drove this quarter\u2019s organic sales growth of 4%. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total Company was 55% in the quarter. Operating profit improved 22% to $127 million as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter, which reported operating margin of 23% in the current quarter. As Mike mentioned, the quarter\u2019s results include approximately $4 million of incremental and tangible asset amortization expense as compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Excluding a $1 million charge in the quarter for restructuring, $2 million charge were step-up in value of acquired inventory and the $4 million of incremental amortization expense. Adjusted operating margin was 24% in the current quarter. As noted in the February earnings call, we did incur incremental costs associated with the adhesive facility\u2019s consolidation effort that impacted total Company operating margin by approximately 50 basis points or $3 million. We\u2019re estimating the incremental costs for this initiative will be about $2 million in the third quarter and $1 million in the fourth quarter. On a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered strong operating margin of 29% in the second quarter or 31% to exclude onetime restructuring charges of approximately $1 million and the $3 million incremental costs related to the facility consolidation efforts. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, reported operating margin was 23% in the second quarter or 26% when excluding $4 million of incremental intangible asset amortization expense and the $2 million of short-term purchase accounting charges related to the step-up in value of Sonoscan acquired inventory. The Industrial Coating segment delivered operating margin of 18% in the second quarter, which is up 70 basis points from the prior year due to volume leverage. On a total Company basis, net income for the quarter was $91 million and GAAP diluted earnings were $1.55 per share, a 40% increase over the prior year GAAP diluted earnings per share. The $4 million of incremental intangible asset amortization charges reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per diluted share, the $2 million for short-term purchase accounting related to step-up in value of acquired inventory and the $1 million of non-recurring restructuring charges reduced earnings per share by $0.04 per diluted share. Additionally, a tax benefit of $2 million or $0.04 per diluted share was recognized in the quarter for excess tax benefits related to share-based payment transactions which are credited to income tax expense. A reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share is included in the financial exhibits of our press release. We delivered strong second quarter EBITDA of a $157 million or $160 million on an adjusted basis to exclude the step-up in value of acquired inventory. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved approximately a 100 basis points over the prior year\u2019s second quarter to 29% of sales. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA was two times at the end of the second quarter. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends, as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. I\u2019ll now turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As in the recently completed second quarter, we are facing very difficult comparisons in our third quarter, where prior year third quarter organic growth was 11%, driven by strong organic growth in all three segments, including 18% organic growth in the Advanced Technology Systems segment. We are forecasting sales be in the range of up 1% to down 3% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This outlook includes organic volume to be in the range of down 2% to down 6%, 1% growth from the first year effect of acquisitions and a positive currency effect of 2% based on the current exchange rate environment as compared to the prior year. We are forecasting solid organic growth in most all product lines in each segment with softness in the dispense product lines, serving electronic and automotive end markets. At the midpoint of this outlook, we expect third quarter gross margin to be about 55% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. We\u2019re estimating third quarter interest expense of about $12 million and depreciation and amortization expense of about $28 million, resulting in third quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.47 to $1.63 per diluted share. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $155 million to a $168 million. Consistent with our comments in the February earnings call, our effective tax rate for the third quarter and full-year, based on current tax law and our jurisdictional mix of income, is estimated to be approximately 25%. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you, Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Again, I\u2019d like to express my appreciation to our outstanding global team for helping deliver record second quarter results. Organic growth in 2017 was exceptionally strong, which means we are up against challenging comparisons during 2018, particularly in the Advanced Technology segment. We do however expect to generate total Company organic sales growth in the low single digits on a full-year basis for fiscal 2018. Our team is committed to leveraging the tools within the Nordson business system to drive operating efficiencies and bottom line results, while delivering the best technology solutions and customer service experience. Our capital deployment objectives remain consistent and we continue to target high-quality opportunities in the marketplace that will help drive our strategic vision for the long-term growth. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Al. Allison Poliniak : Could you talk to any change that you might be experiencing in terms of customer tone or conversations? I mean, are you seeing anything like that or is it pretty consistent with your expectations? Mike Hilton : I would say, the second quarter was certainly pretty consistent with our expectations. And I\u2019d say, when we look at current business, we\u2019re not seeing any particular change in tone from our customers. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then, on Adhesive Dispensing, I think, Mike, you said, organic growth in the back half of the year, and I think I\u2019m just trying Greg to kind to back into your comments. Should we assume organic growth in Adhesive Dispensing in Q3? And I guess, you just have visibility into that side, any color there? Mike Hilton : Yes. We expect to see organic growth in Adhesive segment in Q3. I think as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, the headwinds were really up against or around the mobile electronics dispense piece and some platform work and the automobile segment. Beyond that, the rest of the business was solid and we expect, as we mentioned, to see solid growth in those businesses -- product lines. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning, guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So, as I look, the backlog grew nicely and as I think, at record levels, up 10% core. And it seems like historically, there is pretty good correlation between that next quarter out. So, I\u2019m just trying to kind of reconcile the backlog growth versus the weaker 3Q guide, and maybe how that plays out into 4Q? I don\u2019t know if there is some timing in the orders. Thanks. Mike Hilton : Yes, Jeff. So, if you look at the current backlog, we do have some larger projects, some of which will get delivered in the fourth quarter. I\u2019d say at this point, order rates are kind of flattish to last year. The biggest challenge again is in the electronic dispense piece which we saw dramatic increase in orders last Q3. And so, as we look at this year, the guidance we\u2019re putting out there reflects view that we\u2019re not going to be able to operate in that particular product line at the same level that we saw last year. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s covering our expectations for the third quarter. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, the automotive platform, is that a function of tough comps or are you seeing some slowing in automotive there? Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say, from an operating rate standpoint which affects some of our parts business and so forth, that continues to be solid. But the platform piece is really model changeover related. And we\u2019ve seen that slow down if you look at the overall global statistics from the automakers. Last year was a little softer than year before, and this year is little softer yet. So, platform work generates larger business, and that\u2019s the comp that we\u2019re up against in that particular business. If you look at the other parts of the Industrial Coating business, we\u2019re seeing some nice growth there. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, just finally, can you talk about how you think the medical business grows in the second half of the year kind of relative to normal growth rates? Thanks. Mike Hilton : Yes. We expect to see solid growth in the medical business in the second half of the year, sort of high single digit kind of growth in that business, really along the lines of what we factored. All the different parts of that business are performing well and we\u2019re very pleased with what we see in that business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Couple of questions. First, just with respect to Adhesive Dispensing, the non-restructuring hits you are taking, I think you said $3 million Q2 million, than a step down to $2 million then $1 million. And I don\u2019t have the number in front me, but as I remember, a $4 million to $5 million number in Q1 of this year. So, let\u2019s just call it $10 million in fiscal 2018. Does that all go away in fiscal 2019? And I guess, on top of removing those inefficiencies, what do you gain from an efficiency standpoint? Can you help bridge that? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, let me comment. If you recall on that business, we\u2019re going from three facilities to one in the U.S. in our core components part of that business. Right now, we have four facilities operating as we do the transition. That will continue to throughout the year. And in Europe, we\u2019re going from two to one. So, those are really the facts that we\u2019re operating more facilities than we expect in the long run of contributing to those sort of duplicate parts. And as part of that we\u2019ve been investing in new technology to improve efficiency. So, the duplicate costs should go away in 2018, which should be finished by the end of I\u2019d say, the calendar year, here this year. And then, we would expect to see over time efficiencies. Obviously, that\u2019s a function of volume loading as well, but we expect to see improved efficiencies over time in that business. Matt Summerville : And sticking just with Adhesives, you typically provide a little bit more granularity in terms of business trends by key product categories. Can you talk about more specifics around what you are seeing plastics processing versus non-woven versus rigid, product assembly? Can you give a little more detail there? Mike Hilton : Yes. I\u2019d say, in the various product lines on the plastic side, we\u2019re seeing solid order intake and expectations of growth for the remainder of the year. I\u2019d say, the encouraging sign is that the OEMs are ordering a variety of different end markets that we support. And then, in our core adhesives business, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re seeing solid growth in our packaging area and some improvements in our product assembly and non-wovens we expect to be up for the year but that can vary quarter-to-quarter just based on projects. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Your line is open. Charlie Brady : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Charlie. Charlie Brady : Just a quick one on raw material prices costs, kind of any impact you are seeing on that or maybe might be seeing down the road here rest of the year? Mike Hilton : Yes. Just a couple of comments there, Charlie. I\u2019d say, the area where we are seeing some pushes in the metal side, we have some protection with our agreements and a strong sourcing strategy there. So, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s not really translated into any significant effect at this point. And we think we\u2019ll be able to manage that through our sourcing activities as well as any pricing we can pass on there. So, I don\u2019t see that as a big issue. I\u2019d say, the other part of our cost deck is around labor, and we\u2019re seeing increases there. But that\u2019s a focus of our continuous improvement activity as to help offset those. So nothing I\u2019d say out of the ordinary at the moment. Charlie Brady : Can you just give break down of the aftermarket piece of it, the parts component of it? Generally, it runs pretty high for you guys. I\u2019m wondering any unusual there. Can you give us some granularity on that? Mike Hilton : It\u2019s about half and half at this point. Over time, as things like the medical business grow with the single use components that probably will stay or grow a little bit above that, but right it\u2019s about half and half. Charlie Brady : Right. And just one more for me. So, you guys particularly in life sciences having a lot of new product development going out, actually creating markets you weren\u2019t in a few years ago. Can you talk about kind of the growth you\u2019re seeing just on a new product development standpoint and kind of where you see that going forward, does that accelerate going forward? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, we have had a lot of success with new product development. And quite frankly, that\u2019s a critical focus for us in the long run. So, across all of our product lines, we\u2019re introducing new products, and I\u2019d say we\u2019re getting good traction on those. While this has been a more challenging year from the expense side in the electronics business, we\u2019ve seen nice growth in our inspection business as a result of strong new products. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in our tiering strategy continuing in our adhesives business, including probably 100 or so new customers on a lower tier that we haven\u2019t served before. And we\u2019re seeing some new product introductions in our coatings business, and really taking advantage of some new applications, for example electric battery which should continue to grow in the long run. It\u2019s a nice contributor right now. It\u2019s not going to be huge, but it\u2019s a nice contributor and related to products that fit specifically certain applications across the electric battery. So, I\u2019d say, continues to be the lifeblood of the business. We\u2019re continuing to focus on driving new products. And quite frankly in the long run that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to grow at a multiple something like 2 times global GDP, because we can create new products and get into new markets and new applications. That combination is what helps us grow above GDP in the long run. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. So, the ADS margins, very strong pro forma, maybe a bigger tick-up seasonally than normal. Was there kind of favorable mix or FX impact as you move from to the first quarter to second quarter? Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say, certainly the mix of products across the various product lines was favorable. And we did get a benefit from the currency as well. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And in terms of the non-restructuring bucket hits that I think we\u2019re looking at about $10 million for the year. Is that a better thought of as the pro forma payback than incidental inefficiencies? Mike Hilton : Well, certainly year-on-year that cost should go away. So, there should be a step up. But over time, we should see continued improvement in margin in those product lines as we\u2019ve consolidated, not only consolidated but updated the equipment through automation. So, it\u2019ll be a combination both, as it plays out over time. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. And just curious, your relative view of capital deployment for the balance of the year. You toggle between bolt-ons, debt reduction and share repurchase views. Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say, number one, we do everything we can to continue to support our organic growth. So, that\u2019s not going to change and our dividend approach is not going to change. From an M&A standpoint, we are focused in the short-term with creating more capacity for potential opportunities down the road. So, we have been focused on reducing the debt-to-EBITDA levels and we\u2019ll continue to do that in the near term. I think, longer term, it really depends on timing and how the acquisition pipeline plays out. We have got some good opportunities. As you know, we can never fully predict when they are going to come to fruition. But right now, our near-term focus is on reducing the debt level. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Trusz with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Matthew Trusz : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Matthew Trusz : Have these ADS facility consolidation efforts impacted that segment\u2019s growth anyway? Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say, not in the near-term. I think, the challenge has been for us as we have to operate more facilities than we like in a transition because it\u2019s a largely an engineer to order business. And so, we can\u2019t really build inventory to accelerate that. So, we\u2019ve been moving products equipment in a stepwise fashion as we load up the new facility. So, that\u2019s really translated into the more operating costs than we would have in some other businesses where we can build inventory. Greg Thaxton : Matt, this is Greg. What I\u2019d suggest is, with the investment we\u2019ve made in technology, we\u2019re actually trying to move it in the more positive direction, in more efficient manufacturing environment, better first paste quality, less touch, so actually providing capacity. Matthew Trusz : Okay, thank you. And just following up on your M&A comp and that you\u2019re building capacity. Is there a discrete reason why that you are either seeing larger deals that contribute to build out a certain niche that require bigger investment? Mike Hilton : Well, we made four large acquisitions last year and a couple of smaller ones this year. And so, the focus really has been moving from a 3 plus level down to 2 or so. But we do have a solid pipeline. And we want to make sure that we\u2019re not constrained in any way should the opportunities come forward. So in the near-term that\u2019s not a forever comment; that\u2019s in the near term that still our focus. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from David Stratton with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open. David Stratton : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Mike Hilton : Good morning. David Stratton : What you\u2019re seeing on the foreign basis, are you starting to see or hear anything from your customers regarding the impact of tariffs or just if you can paint some color around what might be going on behind the scenes there and what you are hearing that\u2019d be helpful. Mike Hilton : Yes. I would say, obviously certain customers in certain countries are well aware of the dialogue that\u2019s going back and forth. I would say, they are being vigilant, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s having an impact on any decisions they are making in the near term. So, we are not necessarily seeing any project delays or anything like that as a result of the discussions. Now, we\u2019re pretty balanced around the globe in terms of our manufacturing footprint or ability to supply. So, that\u2019ll be helpful for us going forward. But, in the near term, we are not hearing customers putting off projects as a result of concerns in that regard. David Stratton : And last year, I remember, I think, there was pretty strong mobile phone growth, especially in China regarding automation and once again regarding -- just what\u2019s going on politically and then also in the cycle? Is that growth still there that lags? Mike Hilton : So, last year was a very strong year for the mobile handset market and in particular, there was a lot of new phones introduced and a fair bit of innovation. This year what we\u2019re seeing is a little bit more incremental approach a little bit less innovation, and that\u2019s having an impact on that. I don\u2019t think there is any issues related to politics or anything like that. It\u2019s really just the function of demand. And overall growth in the smartphone area has moderated a little bit. So, a combination of not a lot a new and some moderation in growth is making a little bit more challenging year for us, particularly on the expense side for the mobile handset market. Nothing politically related there. David Stratton : And then, one final for me. Normally, I think you give some adjusted EPS outlook, and it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve done that in this quarter\u2019s press release. So, I was wondering if there is a reason or if you could comment on what you expect the adjusted results to be for the outlook. Greg Thaxton : Yes. This is Greg. No, we didn\u2019t provide any guidance for expected onetime cost in the quarter. We did comment on the duplicate cost which is going to be part of the results, but did not guide to any onetime type of charges in the quarter. If we have them, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be significant. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Chris Dankert : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Chris Dankert : I guess, just kind of building off last question a bit here. Any comments -- I mean, you mentioned that in line semi test was growing nicely. I guess any commentary on investments in China\u2019s semiconductor? How that growth is benefitting the technology segment right now? Mike Hilton : Well, I\u2019d say, the investment has largely -- in China has largely been in the backend packaging side, which is helpful for us. As far as the semiconductor side, there is certainly a lot of government support for additional investment. But that\u2019s not necessarily leading the way as it relates to opportunities for us. The opportunities for us in semi side are in very advanced dispense and very advanced inspections. I\u2019d say in the inspection side, we\u2019ve seen pretty solid growth. I\u2019d say, on the dispense side, some of the newer technology, we have additional interest in that, but hasn\u2019t necessarily come to fruition yet in the last quarter or so. Chris Dankert : Got you. And you said, the organic growth from medical, still looking at high single digit range. I guess, you\u2019ve had Vention convention on board for a year now. Just any commentary on -- did that fully hit target? Is it much better than you expected; just some thoughts on cross-selling, anything on Vention specifically? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, I\u2019d say, Vention is meeting our expectations. I\u2019d say, on the cross-selling side, we\u2019re seeing some uplift there. What we did is we organized our overall medical business into a one Nordson platform and really integrated the other components of our business into the Vention structure where there\u2019s a design and development piece, a components -- proprietary components piece and a very focused finished device piece that includes the prior too. And we like that structure going forward. And we think that gets us closest to the critical customers that drive growth in that business. So, I would say, we feel good about the direction that that\u2019s heading. We feel good about the integration, we feel good about one -- the one Nordson medical approach now with the capability that we have. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. I\u2019ve got just one follow-up on the guidance and then one on the outlook. When you were talking about the GAAP, non-GAAP, EPS in one of the prior questions, so just want to clarify, Greg that in your third quarter you\u2019re not going to have any inventory purchase accounting adjustments or other acquisition costs or severance, anything to adjust the non-GAAP, so the GAAP, non-GAAP should be the same? Greg Thaxton : Correct. We will not have any more inventory step-up for those acquisition related. If there would be any other one-time like restructuring, I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be material, the timing of when those kind of activities hit is unknown. So, there is -- there are no charges in our guidance for EPS related to restructuring. But, again, we\u2019re past the acquisition related charges. We\u2019ve also anniversaried the Vention acquisition. So, we don\u2019t have the incremental intangible asset amortization expense over the prior year, going forward. But, as I mentioned, we do have the duplicate cost associated with the facility consolidation in the numbers and that charges in the EPS guidance. Walter Liptak : Okay. And that was $2 million? Greg Thaxton : Right. Walter Liptak : Okay. And then, when you were -- on the conference call last quarter, you guys were talking about kind of a project funnel in electronics that was pretty full that you said I\u2019m pretty optimistic about. Did something happen during the quarter to make you less optimistic? I think about you talking about your order trends, I think, Mike you mentioned that orders were flat. How are you feeling about electronics in market and the projects funnel going forward? Mike Hilton : Yes. I\u2019d say, there are still some project efforts ongoing. I would say, it feels clearly like a talk here though where there\u2019s less innovation going in. And in the third quarter, particularly last year, we had a huge step-up on the dispense side. And I think, what we\u2019re saying is we don\u2019t see that kind of step up. And that\u2019s really challenge in the third quarter, and quite frankly, the biggest challenge for the whole year. Now, if you look at some of the say the inspection side, we\u2019ve got a more diverse end markets. And we\u2019re seeing a lot of good growth in that part of the business, including areas like auto electronics, which have been fairly strong for us. So, it really comes down to a very significant step-up last year in the third quarter that we\u2019re trying to offset with all the other businesses and that\u2019s a challenge in the quarter. And quite frankly, it\u2019s pressure on the whole year. Walter Liptak : Okay. So, maybe the way to look at it is that we\u2019re kind of in this flat environment where there with Advanced Tech on the tough comps, so in decline. And then, coatings and adhesives sound like they\u2019re experiencing some kind of low single digit growth. Mike Hilton : Yes. I think, if you put it in the perspective for the whole year, we said we expected organically to see sort of that low single digit growth. I think, if you look at the two areas that we called out, sort of spend side for mobile electronics and the auto platform work outside of that and everything else has grown mid single digit plus. So, it\u2019s really the drag associated with those two as a function and particularly largely the electronics dispense piece in a year where there is less customer innovations, so less opportunity for us. So, the other businesses, we expect to have a very solid year. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Matt Summerville : A quick follow-up maybe to your last comment, Mike; last year in fiscal \u201817, rough cuts. What percent of revenue would have been driven by the mobile expense and auto platform businesses you mentioned? Mike Hilton : Yes. So, I think if you look at just the Advanced Tech segment, the mobile piece could have been close to on the expense side, it\u2019s probably in that sort of 20% range or so. And the auto piece was probably about 20% of the coatings business. So, both of those will see decline this year that will be sort of double digit decline. Matt Summerville : And then, just with respect to whether you look sequentially the incremental margin, if you will, on the higher revenue that you\u2019re forecasting, look pretty minimal on a year-over-year basis, decremental on your revenue outlook, looks gigantic. So, just help me understand again the margin implications that maybe this mobile piece is having in ATS. When I look back at your several fiscal Q3s, you have been posting 30% plus margin. What\u2019s implied here today is obviously make the math work, your EPS guidance is considerably less than that? Can you just close the loop on that? Greg Thaxton : Matt, this is Greg. I guess, what I\u2019d suggest is for the base business, so we\u2019ve got the Sonoscan acquisition that\u2019s incremental that is not going to carry the kind of margins the base Nordson business does. It\u2019s got some non-cash charges for purchase accounting that burden those results. If you then take the base business and look at kind of model the just like we have the incremental on the upside, we\u2019re going to have that same kind of decremental on the down side, impacting our margins. So, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d say it\u2019s outsized from what we typically incurred historically. Operator : Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mike Hilton, CEO for any closing remarks. Mike Hilton : Thank you. And thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call. The bottom line, I think our core business is strong. We\u2019ll continue to grow. And we have some strategic acquisitions that we\u2019ve made that we\u2019re pleased with. And we have some opportunities going forward to increase both our organic growth and our acquisition growth consistent with sort of our long-term objectives. So, again, thank you to our global team for staying focused in delivering this quarter and into the future. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Norma. I\u2019m here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, August 21, 2018, to report Nordson's fiscal year 2018 third quarter results and our fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter outlook. Our conference is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until September 4, 2018, which can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 9285137. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the Company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Lara, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's 2018 third quarter conference call. Nordson delivered solid results despite challenging comparisons to our prior year's third quarter. Our total company sales increased 20% inclusive of 11% organic sales growth. Strong organic growth during the quarter within two of our segments was offset by challenging comparison of the Advanced Technology segment. Our prior year organic growth was 18%. Our commitment to delivering the best technology solutions while employing continuous improvement initiatives, so bottom line performance, generating operating margin of 23%. Free cash flow before dividends was a $118 million which reflects strong cash conversion of 124% of net income. Our base business is strong and we remain focused on bringing value to our customers and the diverse end markets that we serve. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our guidance reflects strength in adhesives and medical product lines, all set primarily by lower demand for Advanced Technology dispense product lines that serve the electronics end markets and automotive cold material product lines. For the full year, we are on pace to deliver another consecutive year of organic sales growth, which is a reflection of the stability of the end markets we serve and our ability to drive initiatives that lead organic volume growth. I'll speak more about our outlook in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide a more detailed perspective on the third quarter, as well as our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I'll first provide some comments on our third quarter results before moving on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Third quarter sales decreased 1% from the prior year's third quarter, inclusive of a decrease of approximately 3% inorganic volume, 1% growth related the first year effective acquisitions and 1% growth related to the favorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year's third quarter. Organic sales volume was in line with our guidance as we expected moderation against last year's results where all segments demonstrated strong organic sales growth. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, organic volume increased 3% on top of 6% organic growth in last year's third quarter. We're pleased with the pace of the end market demand across all product lines. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, organic volume was down 11% as compared to the prior year's third quarter organic growth of 18%. With the exception of those product lines facing the most challenging comparisons to the prior year, namely dispense and surface treatment product lines serving electronics end markets, demand was robust during the quarter for test, inspection and fluid management product lines, including medical components. Within the Industrial Coating segment, powder painting and container coating product line grow this quarter's organic sales growth of 6% compared to the prior year. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 55% in the quarter. Operating profit was $136 million with reported operating margin of 23% in the current quarter. As discussed in previous earnings releases, we've been incurring incremental costs associated with the consolidation of certain adhesive facilities. The impact of this effort is approximately $7 million year-to-date. Specific to the third quarter, incremental costs were approximately $2 million. In the fourth quarter, we're estimating the incremental costs will be about $1 million. On a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered strong operating margin of 28% in the quarter, or 29% to exclude onetime restructuring charges of approximately $1 million related to the facility consolidation effort. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, reported operating margin was 25% in the third quarter, the Industrial Coating segment reported operating margin was 22%, which is up by 160 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily related to improved sales mix and our deployment of tools from the Nordson business system. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $95 million, and GAAP diluted earnings were $1.61 per share. EPS was reduced by $0.02 per diluted share from the $1 million non-recurring restructuring charge mentioned previously. EPS benefitted by approximately $2 million or $0.03 per diluted share from discreet tax benefits. A reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share is included in the financial exhibits of our press release. We delivered strong third quarter EBITDA of $163 million or 28% of sales. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA was 2x at the end of the third quarter, as we have successfully delivered from the Vention acquisition. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. I\u2019ll now turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. We\u2019re forecasting sales to be in the range of flat to down 4% compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. This outlook includes organic volume to be in the range of up 1% to down 3%, 1% growth from the first year effective acquisitions, and an unfavorable currency translation effect of 2% based on the current exchange rates environment as compared to the prior year. Our guidance reflects strength in adhesive and medical product lines, offset primarily by lower demand against very challenging comparisons for Advanced Technology dispense product lines serving electronics' end markets as well as automotive cold material product lines within the Industrial Coating segment. At the midpoint of this outlook, we expect fourth quarter gross margin to be above 54% and operating margin to be approximately 22%. We're estimating fourth interest expense of about $8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of about $27 million resulting in fourth quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $1.38 to $1.54 per diluted share. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $143 million to $155 million. Consistent with our comments in the February earnings call, our estimated effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year, based on current tax laws and our jurisdiction of mix of income is approximately 25%. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Again I'd like to express my appreciation to our outstanding global team. We knew we are facing challenging comparisons this year and the team continues to deliver growth. I\u2019m particularly pleased with the growth we\u2019ve generated in our medical product lines, which has been a primary area of focus for our corporate development team, helping to drive topline growth and offset the cyclicality of the electronic systems product line within our Advanced Technology segment. For the full fiscal year of 2018, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect to generate total company organic sales growth of about 2%. This is growth on top of 8% organic growth in fiscal 2017 and 7% organic growth in fiscal 2016. Our ability to deliver organic growth again this year highlights the attractiveness of the end markets we serve, our ability to capture growth initiatives and our ability to continue to meet our customer's expectations. We also remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders. Earlier this month, we announced a dividend increase of 17%. This marks the 55th consecutive year of annual dividend increases, ranking us 14th among publicly traded companies for the longest running record of annual dividend increases. We take pride in returning a portion of our cash flow to our shareholders and we appreciate your continued support. Complementing our dividend increase, our other capital deployment objectives remain consistent. We'll continue to prioritize acquisition opportunities in our targeted markets that will help drive our strategic vision for long-term growth. We're focused on finishing strong with another good year of organic sales growth, enhancing bottom line results of continuous improvements using the Nordson business system, and providing superior service and technology to our customers. With that we'll pause now and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Just wondering at ATS you have the period of the lower mobile demand, as that plays out. How would you describe the pipeline of your field testing activity across various applications within those markets as informing your expectation for waves of future innovation to drive demand for you guys? Mike Hilton : So at a high level, I think as we talked about in the beginning of year, we said this is likely to be a more challenging year, particularly in the mobile segment. And that's sort of the way it played out with modest volume growth and not a lot of innovation. That's kind of the way it played out. If I look at the various segments that we're involved with, I think the things that will drive mobile in the future, will be the move to 5G that has some impacts on what goes into mobile devices particularly phones, and there are some other areas around RFI shielding and so forth that we see as opportunities going forward in addition to any other innovation that our customers would put into the phones. And we continue to see strong growth in the auto electronic side of things as our customers are putting more cameras, more sensors into the cars. And ultimately, we think long-term, as we move closer to autonomous driving is going to be more input into the cars and that'll play well for us. And then as we mentioned a couple of times here over the last year, we're doing more on the tail end of the semiconductor side with both dispense and inspection, and we think that will continue to grow over time. So we do this coming into the year was going to be a challenging year if you look at our guidance through the fourth quarter, we're likely to be flat to modestly down in that electronics portion of the segment. So our diversification efforts have helped us mitigate a pretty significant decline in to the dispense business. We're not -- probably going to be quite there, but it's helping to do that. And then, obviously the other parts of that segment, the medical business in particular, is growing very nicely and meeting our expectations there. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then on the geographies, could you help understand the magnitude that Japan decline in the quarter versus overall Asia-Pac or Asia-Pac, ex-Japan, much more moderate softness. What differentiates Japan in terms of the higher volatility there? Greg Thaxton : Yes, I think that's really related again for the electronics side of the business. If you think about a lot of final assembly going together in China, but a lot of component manufacturing being outside China and Japan is one of the key areas where we see a lot of component manufacturing. And that's really related to the component manufacturer going into the phone line. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Charlie Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open. Charlie Brady : Yes, hi, good morning guys. That's Charlie Brady. Mike, wanted to touch on the Nordson Medical Business. You just touched on a little bit about the growth rate you're seeing there. It sounds like that business positioning today relative to where it's been over the past couple of years with some of those acquisitions. But it sounds like the growth path of that business has picked up a pretty decent amount, the amount of innovation coming out of that has picked up. Is this -- can you just talk about kind of the efforts you guys have made to really kind of more focused on that business in terms of organic development, not just the acquisition stuff you guys have done? Mike Hilton : Yes, I think that's a good point, Charlie. There is a lot of new products that are coming out of our medical business. And I think one of the things that helped with the acquisition we made last year with the Vention business, and the restructuring we've done along the Vention model. There is a sort of design and development pipeline on the front end. It really gives us in early with key customers not only the large customers, but some of the emerging innovators. And what that allows us to do is innovate our systems and our components around their desires and where things are heading. And a big focus is around minimally invasive procedures. So when you think about what the fastest growing part of the medical devices segment is, it is around minimally invasive procedures, and that's heart and lung and brain and some spinal cord and other vascular areas. And our design and development capabilities and our components fit nicely into those end markets. So what we have now is a more complete set of offerings that allow those to participate in more opportunities. So we have a strong pipeline there and we're introducing a lot of products to support the growth there. And we're excited about what we see. Charlie Brady : Yes, that's helpful, thanks. And then just switching gears here. On the something question here on industry call, price costs, do you guys have seen raw material inflation as pricing got to put through. Can you just talk a little bit about what's your experience in terms of the past? Mike Hilton : Yes, so there are some raw material increases that things like steel and aluminum that we see. Our sourcing team has done a nice job of the mitigating the impact there and we've also been able to move some pricing to, I'd say largely to this point offset the impact that we've seen. But there is some cost push there that's a typical, I think, we've been able to offset. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : First, sort of do a walk-through in terms of what you saw in the quarter across the four pieces of the adhesive business, talking about rigid packaging, polymer, nonwoven and product assembly. And I guess looking out, at least into the fourth quarter, even into early next year, is that what your overall outlook is for those businesses? Mike Hilton : So if you look in the third quarter, I would say, our core adhesive business that was pretty solid, stronger packaging, and product assembly a little softer than nonwoven, but that we can see quarter-to-quarter movement there based on big projects. So I don\u2019t read anything into that. And we've had pretty strong comp prior year about 6%. I\u2019d say in our plastic product lines, pretty solid performance in the quarter across most product lines within our plastics business and building a strong backlog in that particular area for the point that we\u2019re seeing some lead time to expand a little bit not only for us, but some others in the industry. So that\u2019s encouraging to see the backlog there build across the plastic components piece of things. Matt Summerville : And then just as a follow-up, while I recognized you guys are in sort of the short cycle nature of the business you don\u2019t really guide beyond the next quarter. Having said that, to your point earlier like given some of these comparisons you are facing, specifically the 50% plus comp that you\u2019re facing in advance tax in the fiscal first quarter of '19, is there any comment you might make is to whether or not you feel the street at this point is effectively handicapping or capturing that comp? Mike Hilton : Yes, I mean, obviously the comp is out there. And so I think most folks recognize that. I can't really comment on whether everybody is looking at that. But I\u2019d say if we step back, and this is where the quarter-to-quarter kind of movements can maybe give an improper indication of how the business is doing fundamentally. If we step back and look year-over-year, this is, as I said earlier for the electronics business, this is a challenging year, but we\u2019re going to be close to flat offsetting a pretty significant drop in mobile with the spend, with the efforts that we\u2019ve had to diversify both from a customer and an application standpoint and the strengths of the other parts of our electronics business. And then I thank the continued growth in medical and general industries activities are going to more than offset what we've seen there, which, I think is pretty good performance here, but you can see these swings quarter-to-quarter because we can't control what our customers are going to play orders. What we can't control is how we respond to those and take advantage of it. So I think if you look at sort of annually and over a cycle, you\u2019re going to see this business continuing to grow in the short-term, there is more volatility, and we\u2019re trying to mitigate that with our diversification efforts. Matt Summerville : Thanks Mike. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, this is Carl [indiscernible] on for Chris. So just kind of on the facility consolidation, do you have any updates on kind of the timing and expected benefits there? Mike Hilton : Yes, so we\u2019re looking at by the end of the calendar year to be through the consolidation efforts. The primary effort is in the U.S. although we have some effort in Germany as well, but we should be through both of those by the end of the calendar year. And I think as Greg mentioned earlier, he is highlighted what the additional cost that we\u2019ve seen this year as a result of that consolidation, we would expect that to go away next year. In the long run, we would expect to see some more efficiencies come out of the new facilities as well. But right now, we\u2019re still in the middle of the final transfers and ramping up the new facilities. So not ready to project the efficiency improvements beyond that at this point. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks. And then any update on like the tier product offering and growth in ADS, ATS there? Greg Thaxton : Did you say adhesives or ATS. So adhesives, yes, we've seen some nice growth in our despite my former comment here and some nice growth in the lowest peer of non-woven's business as we've talked about that before. We're into a group of customers we haven't captured before. And I think, both from an end customer standpoint and the OEM standpoint, we're seeing nice growth there beyond what we have expected for the year. So that's very encouraging, because in the end they'll move up a line. So I think that's good. I'd also say in adhesives, we've added to our systems additional measuring capabilities and our packaging business, which our customers find very helpful. And the material suppliers also find very helpful in demonstrating the benefits, not only of our equipment, but of their materials. And so we're working closely with them. So I think that's encouraging as well. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Trusz of Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Matthew Trusz : Are you seeing tariffs or trade rhetoric more broadly impacting your customers in a way that's impactful for your business? And I guess, overall, I'd wonder, what is your overall business confidence in macro outlook now, and has that evolved at all over the last 3 months since we last talk? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say, it's hard to say that we've seen any significant impact on the tariff discussions to date. I would say in general, projects are proceeding as the way they would normally proceed. I think the sort of broader discussions about more aggressive tariffs, particularly with China and China with the U.S. is a little bit more concerning, and that could have some broader impact. We're encouraged to see there is some discussion going on right now, but it's hard to predict where that's going to head. I'd say our view of the overall macro accounting hasn't really changed. And I think in the last quarter, we talked a little bit about the U.S. being stronger than it has been for the last 2 to 3 years. However, Japan and Europe are still growing, but at a softer rate than we certainly saw last year. And China is hanging in at about the same rate as we saw last year certainly not improving. So one thing that has changed significantly and whether that's a function of the tariff discussions or a function of federal reserve policy as currency has flipped around as we look going into the next quarter from being a tailwind to a headwind. So that's probably the one thing at this point looks a little bit different, and it's hard to predict how that's going to go forward as well. But I'd say sort of the outlook we saw three months ago is pretty similar, I'd say, there is some added concern if the tariff is escalates more. Matthew Trusz : Okay, thanks. And then with automotive, how much visibility in that end market do you have, and how do you feel about cold dispensing opportunities as we look forward next year [indiscernible] platforms or otherwise? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say we have a pretty good idea of projects that are planned. I'd say not all those go ahead. And so, if you look at, we talked about this last time, I think we saw sort of global platform speaks in '16, modest decline last year, more of a decline this year. It's hard to tell exactly what the cycle is going to be on that. I think, obviously, drive to more efficient pieces is important, but I would say, one of the areas that we're pursuing in our cold material side of the business is our focus around the electric battery side, both for the automobile side of things and also for the storage capability. And we've seen some nice growth although relatively modest in terms of total revenue this year. But that's an encouraging a longer-term opportunity for not only our cold materials, but a number of our businesses. And then in the cold material space, we're also doing some work of the aerospace side, and say the whole qualification process there has taken longer than we would have expected. But we see some good opportunities there as the industry looks to do to drive automation to help them out with their backlog of orders into effectively increase their capacity. So those are two areas that we see as growth opportunities for that part of the business as well. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I have a follow-up from Matt Summerville of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks all for a couple more. Just with respect to ICS, a very, I mean, all here really very good incremental margins in that business. Can you talk about sort of what's driving that? Is that mix related with some of that auto stuff maybe not as strong as it was in the prior year period? And I guess, ultimately where do you think ICS can go? I mean, from earnings, can that be a 20% plus margin business for you guys? Mike Hilton : So Matt, you're correct. Certainly the mix has helped, when you look at the mix of different product lines there, and auto tends to have a bigger buying component and some of other systems. So with that being off a little bit, the mix has helped. But we also have done a lot of good things utilizing the merchant business system to drive productivity there. As we said, going back 4 or 5 years, we wanted to get that business up to something like 20% margin and we're getting close. And we still have things to work on there. I think just given the nature of the business, I don't think it's reasonable to expect that it would be in excess of 20% just because of the scope of what we typically supply and how much is more standard buying equipment, but I think, 20% is still a good goal, and we're getting close to it. Matt Summerville : And then similarly, my question on ADS earlier, with respect to Advanced Tech, can you may be provide a little bit more granularity? I think last quarter you indicated outside of the mobile space, specifically most of your businesses if not all, in Advanced Tech, were growing in that high single to low double-digit rates. Can you kind of talk about, was the mobile piece up 50% this quarter and everything's up 10%. Can you just give us a better feel for how those various pieces of the segment there are really performing? Mike Hilton : Yes, what I would say, if you look at the total segment, I remember half of it or more now is not electronics and that\u2019s performing well both for general industry a piece and the medical. And the medical fees is part of the verification effort and we expect that to be high single digit, double digit growth going forward and its playing out the way we expect it. I think within the electronics segment, the test inspection business has been very solid this year with nice growth in part because that serves a more diverse end market and we see in the dispense side of the business, in particular. So the two biggest components for that business are test inspection and dispense and test inspection for the year will be up nicely. Dispense is going to be off significantly and that really is the mobile related piece. As I said overall, we expect that part of the business, electronics part of the business, it will be down modestly, but you know we feel like we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground between the diversification efforts within electronics and then the diversification efforts in that segment outside of electronics. Matt Summerville : And then just maybe one quick one for Greg. It looked like corporate expense stepped up quite a bit couple of million bucks on a sequential basis. Can you talk about that? And I guess what\u2019s your expectation would be built in for Q4? Greg Thaxton : Yes, there were a couple of onetime items -- onetime expense items in the quarter that is in that corporate manage numbers. So I wouldn\u2019t suggest that that\u2019s a new run rate. I probably back it down back to that $30 million range going forward. Matt Summerville : That\u2019s all from me. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Liptak of Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Well, I just want to do couple of follow-on related to China. You know in the past and last year, especially you had talked about some of the Chinese mobile phone makers as some of the new products that have been traction and grown. There is no discussion of that. I wonder if you could help us understand how much of the tough comp is related to the Chinese mobile phone makers. And was there a pause like -- it was like the demand -- the capacity went in and now we\u2019ve got a pause out of China or is that more broad attempt? Mike Hilton : No, what I would say is two things. If you look at sort of total smartphone growth, there was pretty -- it\u2019s been pretty modest like 1%, 2% growth for the year. So it\u2019s not a big volume driver. So that affects all of the customers that buy mobile phones. And two, this is the year with less innovation. So it's going to be incremental. And that\u2019s the sort of a typical pattern that we\u2019ve seen a strong year of innovation and a weaker year of innovation. And so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing here. And I\u2019d say on the Chinese mobile side, no difference in terms of how they\u2019ve approached the things. Now they\u2019ve probably gained a little bit of market share in short-term, but, probably, I think that would dramatically drive the needle one way or the other. Walter Liptak : Okay. Is what you\u2019re saying that the Chinese mobile manufacturers that they're still growing because they come off a small base or \u2026 Mike Hilton : No. They're not a small base anymore, but they are still growing. I'd say the opportunity is still there for increased levels of automation, so both in terms of the degree of overall automation and in terms of their process approach if they take. It's less than -- less sophisticated than the global base. But I'd say in general, this has been a pretty quiet here for innovation. And so, as we've talked about the past, the smartphone penetration got closer to the saturation that's really around change and innovation. And this year has been a weaker year across the board on that. Walter Liptak : Okay got it. And then just a follow-on on -- I appreciate your answer on the tariff question, but I wonder, specifically I'm curious you've run through the $50 billion tariff and the $200 billion tariff. Are your product categories included in either of those tariff discussions? Mike Hilton : So I'd say in the first set of tariffs, very few, very modest. In the second set, we don't really know yet all of the details on the code. And we don't know what the Chinese response is going to be. So that's -- those are two unknowns to date. And so we'll have to wait and see. Obviously, we're trying to understand that as best we can and we've got a team focused on that. But there is not enough clarity yet to make a comment there. But I'd say when you talk about $200 billion, it gets more concerning. Walter Liptak : Okay. And it's -- let's say that in the second, $200 billion that your product going into China for electronic assembly was included in. Is that 25% increase -- is that big enough to be deterrent to the band or is there any other choice? I don't think there is any local supply for the kind of dispensing equipment that you make for electronics? Mike Hilton : I would really not want to speculate here until we see how that plays out. Obviously we would -- we do have manufacturing capability into go and we are doing both test inspection in some of our good tiered dispense products out of there. But we would pull all the levers we could if there was an impact to us. Like I said, we really are waiting to get a better feel for both the U.S. side and the Chinese side and trying to anticipate what might happen and how we might mitigate any particular impacts there. But I would just say, in general, when you look at that magnitude of the number, it's more concerning than $15 billion or $16 billion. Operator : Thank you. I have a follow-up from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Just wondering if you could remind us what the algorithm is for FX translation as impacts EPS ultimately with when you add in the transactional influences? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Chris. This is Greg. If you look historically, the way it kind of models out is, if you look at the percentage change in sales, it's a 2 to 3 times that number percentage change in EPS. So if currency adds 1% to sales, it might be a plus 2.5% tailwind to earnings per share change from the prior year. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. And then on interest, I'm not sure if my numbers are right, but I think you have $13 million in the quarter and said $8 million for the fourth quarter. Can you explain this dynamic there if I got those numbers correct? Greg Thaxton : Yes. So, a little bit of a timing issue where we had some cash on the balance sheet that will post the third quarter year end, we will be paying down some debt. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hilton for closing remarks. Mike Hilton : Well, thank you for your interest in our call today. And thank you again to our global team for continuing to serve our customers as well. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Lara Mahoney. You may begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I am here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, December 13, 2018 to report Nordson\u2019s fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter and full year results and our fiscal year 2019 outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investor-relations and will be available there for 14 days and at nordson.com/investors. There also will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until Thursday, December 20, 2018 which can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 6659799. During this conference call, forward-looking statements maybe made regarding our future performance based on Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Lara and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year conference call. I would like to begin by recognizing our global team who have delivered another record year of sales, operating profit, GAAP diluted earnings per share and EBITDA. Our performance highlights are continued commitment to delivering the best technology solutions to our customers and to generating growth through innovation and superior customer service. For the full fiscal year of 2018, sales were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% compared to the same period a year ago. This included organic sales growth of nearly 2.5% in the current year against two challenging prior fiscal year comparisons where we generated robust organic sales of 8% and 7% in 2017 and \u201816 respectively. Specific to the fourth quarter and in line with our prior guidance, sales were $569 million, a 1% decrease compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Operating profit in the quarter was $115 million or 20% of sales. Excluding restructuring charges in the quarter, operating margin was 21%. The fourth quarter\u2019s performance included several long-term investments that will ultimately yield benefits to our customers and shareholders. These investments included the previously announced facility consolidation efforts in the adhesive segment where we are consolidating facilities in both the United States and Germany. Other notable investments during the quarter included the continued build-out of our centralized shared service center in the United States and an ERP conversion that brings several of our advanced technology systems product lines on to our common operating platforms to support that centralized shared service. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $143 million or 25% of sales or 26% excluding restructuring charges of $3 million. Free cash flow before dividends increased 5% over the prior year to $118 million, which reflects strong cash conversion of 136% of net income. I will speak more about our fiscal 2019 annual guidance in a few moments. But I first turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed perspective on the fourth quarter and full year of 2018. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike and good morning to everyone. Fourth quarter sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. This change in sales included a decrease of 1% in organic volume, growth related to the first year effect of acquisitions of approximately 1% and a decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter of 1%. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, organic volume increased 3% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We are pleased with the pace of our end-markets as well as growth in new applications and within our tiering strategy. Within the Advanced Technology System segment, organic volume decreased 2% against challenging organic volume growth comparisons of 4% and 30% in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016 respectively. With the exception of those product lines facing the most challenging comparisons to the prior year namely dispense and surface treatment product lines serving electronic end markets, demand was robust during the quarter for test and inspection and fluid management product lines, notably medical components. Within the Industrial Coatings segment, organic volume declined 7%, mostly related to automotive platform sales that did not repeat from the prior year. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 54% in the quarter. Operating profit was $115 million with reported operating margin of 20% in the current quarter. As Mike noted adjusted total company operating margin to exclude restructuring charges was 21%. And Mike also talked about other entity level initiatives that impacted spending in the quarter that will provide future performance benefits. Specific to the adhesive facility consolidation initiative, we incurred approximately $1 million of duplicate cost during the quarter and approximately $8 million for the full fiscal year. We expect to be mostly complete with this project by the end of the calendar year with minimal duplicate cost of about $1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 for both the U.S. and Germany consolidation efforts. On a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered strong operating margin of 27% in the quarter or 28% when excluding restructuring charges of $2 million related to this facility consolidation. This adjusted fourth quarter margin performance was equal to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment operating margin was 20% in the fourth quarter as compared to prior year\u2019s fourth quarter margin, lower sales volume, acquisition dilution, product mix and higher spending contributed to the margin decline. Industrial Coatings segment operating margin was 20%, an improvement of 200 basis points despite a decline in sales volume. This is a result of product mix and the segment\u2019s continuous improvement initiatives. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $87 million and GAAP diluted earnings were $1.47 per share. The current quarter included restructuring charges of $0.04 per share and discrete tax benefits of $0.07 per share. Adjusted EPS to exclude these one-time items was $1.44. A reconciliation of GAAP earnings per share to non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share is included in the financial exhibits of our press release. We delivered fourth quarter EBITDA of $143 million or 25% of sales, inclusive of $3 million of restructuring charges. As Mike noted previously, free cash flow before dividends during the quarter was $118 million or 136% of net income. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. I will now share a few comments on our full year results. Sales for the fiscal year were $2.3 billion, an increase of 9% compared to the same period a year ago. This change in sales included organic volume growth of nearly 2.5%, a 5% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions and a 2% increase due to the favorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Full year operating profit was $495 million, which is an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Reported operating margin was 22% or 23% on an adjusted basis to add back $10 million of incremental intangible asset amortization expense related to our fiscal 2018 and \u201817 acquisitions and adding back $10 million of one-time charges for restructuring and a step-up in value of acquired inventory. This performance is equal to the prior year\u2019s adjusted operating margin to add back charges of $20 million associated with the Vention transaction cost, the step up in value of acquired inventory and restructuring charges. Net income for the full year was $377 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $6.40. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% compared to the prior year to $5.94. A reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings per share is included with the financial exhibits to our press release. EBITDA for the full year increased 11% to $605 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 8% to $609 million both compared to the prior year. EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin were both 27% of sales. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to EBITDA was 2x trailing 12 months EBITDA at the end of the fiscal year. In addition to funding organic and acquisitive growth initiatives with our strong free cash flow, Nordson returned value to its shareholders by distributing $72 million in dividends in fiscal year 2018 and investing $19 million for the repurchase of shares during the fourth quarter. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a few closing comments and our fiscal 2019 annual guidance. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. Once again, I want to thank our team for delivering solid full year results. In a very challenging prior year sales growth comparisons, we were able to hold operating margins steady after you adjust for incremental, intangible, amortization expense and certain one-time charges. We also grew EBITDA by 11% over fiscal 2017 inclusive of the strategic investments I spoke about earlier, which we believe will allow us to deliver improved performance going forward. In addition to executing on our financial targets, we took another step forward in growing our medical expertise by acquiring Clada Medical Devices in October. Clada is a Galway, Ireland-based design and development operation primarily focused on medical balloons and balloon catheters. These technologies are used in key applications such as angioplasty and the treatment of vascular disease. Clada has a successful track record of innovation, quality and customer focus, which makes it a great fit within our medical product portfolio. We also continued our legacy of investing a portion of our success into the communities where we live and work and we reach significant milestones in 2018. Since its inception, Nordson has given more than $100 million through a variety of charitable initiatives and our employees have volunteered nearly 100,000 hours. That\u2019s quite an impact and something we are very proud of. Now, I will turn to our focus to fiscal 2019. After much thought and external benchmarking, we made the decision to transition from providing quarterly guidance to annual guidance. There is certainly a growing consensus in the market about the positive effects of doing so and we believe investors are best served by focusing on our longer term performance. Our quarterly guidance can create noise that distracts from the overall strength of the business. To emphasize our long-term annual growth, we have added a new exhibit to our press release that illustrates the company\u2019s consistent annual organic sales growth. For the full fiscal year 2019, organic sales volume is expected to increase in the range of 3% to 5% compared to fiscal 2018 offset by an unfavorable currency translation effect of 2% based on the current exchange rate environment as compared to the prior year. We recognized that we will face a challenging comparison in the first quarter. However, we are forecasting the strength and diversity of our end-markets, our ability to execute on our growth initiatives will enable another year of solid organic sales growth. With this sales growth and our focus on executing the Nordson business system, we expect to generate an increase in both operating margin and EBITDA margin between 100 basis points and 150 basis points over fiscal 2018 performance. To be clear, this improvement will be over adjusted fiscal 2018 results to add back charges of $3 million related to short-term purchase accounting for the step up in the value of acquired inventory and approximately $7 million of restructuring charges. For fiscal 2019, the company expects interest expense to be approximately $45 million and maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $50 million. The company\u2019s forecasted effective tax rate is approximately 23%. Our strategic priorities for the year remain consistent with prior years. We\u2019re focused on accelerating organic growth, diversifying our end-markets through acquisitions and optimizing Nordson for the future. As always thank you to our customers, employees, and shareholders for your continued support. With that, we\u2019ll pause and now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Allison. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Allison Poliniak : Greg, you had called out a number of headwinds to margin on ATS. Could you maybe help us understand or bucket or if you think can quantify it, what was the biggest impact there? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Allison, I\u2019d say the bigger impact if you take a point out related to the dilution from our acquisitions, the larger impact would have been the margin mix, where what was down in sales in this quarter versus a robust prior year were our dispensing product lines that tend to carry higher gross margins than some of the other product lines do. So that was a big impact in the quarter. Mike Hilton : And to be clear, the other product lines were up. Greg Thaxton : Right. Allison Poliniak : Got it. Greg Thaxton : Now, there was also some spending that was up over the prior year, some of the initiatives that we called out like the conversion onto one of our common platforms were product lines within that segment. So during the quarter we had some readiness for that conversion, which took place at the beginning of this fiscal year. So there was some spend \u2013 incremental spend that also impacted it, but I\u2019d say, the larger items were those first two. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then within the context of your full-year organic guide, just given the comparisons in the first half, should we assume this is a much more second half weighted growth story for Nordson? Mike Hilton : Yes, Allison, if you look at it, we expect this year to be more of the typical seasonal year we\u2019d see with sort of the softer first quarter picking up in the second and the stronger second half. Momentum in the business is encouraging, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s a typical seasonal pattern that we would expect. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Hey, thanks, good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Glynn : You talked about normal seasonality next year picking up on the seasonal trend, the ATS revenue was pretty moderate within the variable range of seasonality into fourth quarter. Just wondering if the electronics was more resilient than you expected in the quarter? Mike Hilton : In the fourth quarter? Christopher Glynn : Yes, for ATS. The organics was little better than we thought. Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say, electronics came in about as we expected. As Greg mentioned earlier, we had \u2013 still has some tough comparisons on the dispense side, the test inspection did well. But our diversification efforts outside of electronics really played out in that segment with both our EFD product lines and especially, our medical product lines being particularly strong in the quarter to offset some of that impact. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s been more \u2013 it was more around the other parts of the segment than the electronics piece. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then, I know it\u2019s always a tough one to call, but curious to your latest thoughts on kind of the latency period if that\u2019s the right description into drivers of future changes in your field work across the mobile vertical? Mike Hilton : Yes, I\u2019d say, it still will \u2013 Christopher Glynn : Just for kind of the next wave. Mike Hilton : Yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s still little early. I think as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s usually kind of from November through probably February even early March, where we do all these development programs and then get a sense of what the change is. As we\u2019ve talked before, we think the next bigger change is going to come with 5G. What isn\u2019t clear is whether that\u2019s a \u201819 or \u201820 phenomenon at this point. But what I would say is, I mentioned just a second ago is, we feel good about the things that we\u2019re doing in diversifying both the electronics, so growth in auto, the test inspection business, but particularly in the general industries areas, the EFD product lines support as well as medical, which is strong. And then outside of that, our typical focus on innovation in both adhesives and the coatings business to get into new markets and applications, and we\u2019re using tiering effectively as well to expand our geographic reach and things like building our business in India and in Vietnam, in Thailand and entering Africa. So we feel good \u2013 I\u2019d say good about all the other things as well particularly our diversification effort. Christopher Glynn : Sounds good. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : So let\u2019s start on the margin expansion year-over-year. Could you just help provide some buckets on how you\u2019re going to get to the 100 basis points, 150 basis points, how much of it is stranded costs and things you incurred in 2018 that don\u2019t repeat in fiscal \u201819? How much of it is benefits from things that you\u2019ve implemented in fiscal \u201818 that you should see savings or improvement from and then how much is volume or any other buckets you think I might be missing? Greg Thaxton : Sure. Okay, Mike, this is Greg. I\u2019ll take a stab at that and Mike can then add comments. Certainly, a portion of that improvement is going to come from some of the duplicate costs that we\u2019ve called out associated with the adhesive facility consolidations. So maybe that\u2019s 40 basis points, maybe slightly less. We\u2019ll have a little bit of some costs here in the first quarter, but call it 40 basis points there. But beyond that then, we do expect to get benefit out of this transition to our shared service center here in the United States, where we\u2019ve got a bit of some cost overlap as we\u2019ve stood up this facility, and we expect to get some of the benefits out of that in 2019 and beyond as we continue to grow and are better able then to leverage these back office costs. So that\u2019s going to be part of it as well. Certainly as you called out, we\u2019ll get a bit of volume leverage if we hit these kind of growth targets we\u2019re talking about and then it\u2019s a lot of blocking and tackling that we do in all of the segments utilizing the Nordson business system, whether that\u2019s continued focus on low-cost country sourcing, pricing initiatives, the various tools that we leverage, none of those maybe doubles, triples home runs, a lot of singles, but it\u2019s the kind of thing that we continue to focus on to help drive margin. So I kind of called out the couple of larger buckets, but it\u2019s going to be a lot of this continued focus on continuous improvement that\u2019s going to help leverage that. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And just to be clear on the cadence of revenue for next year. It sounds like you\u2019re just basically assuming pretty normal sequentials as you work through the year, no sharp bounce back, and that when you look at the segments themselves pretty stable demand levels from here, is that the thought process? Mike Hilton : Yes. We\u2019re expecting all of our businesses to grow next year. And I\u2019d say in typical fashion with our longer term views of each of those opportunities, I think at a high level, we\u2019re focused on \u2013 the economy is growing at maybe a little less than they\u2019ve grown this year, but we expect to, as we typically do to outgrow the markets with all of our focus around innovation and driving new products and applications. So we feel pretty good about each of the businesses and where we are and delivering as a result of how we focus on creating our own demand plus we won\u2019t have the same headwinds that we had this year particularly in the mobile dispensing segment. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And then just on the industrial coating side, the \u2013 called out the auto side as the headwind in the quarter here. Is that the right base to work off of as we think forward or is there some capture coming up with project timing or anything like that? Mike Hilton : So I would say that\u2019s probably the right base to work on. From our perspective, the auto platform business has been down in the last couple of years. We expect it to be kind of more stable at this point, but growth in that business is really going to come from newer applications. So things like battery work for electric vehicles and some work we\u2019re doing in aerospace and some additional work we\u2019re doing on coatings for food processing and then continued strength in our powder-related businesses. So we are not expecting any sort of significant growth on the auto platform side of the business. If you look around the world, particularly in the U.S., so the car production has been flat for the last 3 years. China, it\u2019s flat to maybe slightly down, so we\u2019re not necessarily counting on that. Mike Halloran : Great. Appreciate the time as always. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Couple of questions. First, can you provide an update as to how U.S.-China trade relations are impacting your business both from a cost standpoint as well as end demand? And I guess, have you seen any customer behavior change over the last month or two? And is this a consideration that you factored into your fiscal \u201819 organic outlook? Mike Hilton : So there\u2019s a lot of questions there, Matt, but I\u2019ll try and address those. So on the first part, so the impact to-date has been pretty modest not without a lot of effort on our part to make it pretty modest. So given the work we have in our procurement area to mitigate the sort of cost push, and as certainly those vendors trying to push cost in steel and aluminum, for example, and we\u2019ve been able to mitigate that pretty well. Some of the other tariffs that were put in place had some modest effects, but we\u2019ve been working the things that you would expect looking at different sourcing options, moving our supply chain around a bit, driving pricing. So I\u2019d say, to-date, it\u2019s been relatively modest. We have included some impact more on the cost side than I would say on the revenue side in 2019 to account for, so the continuation of what we\u2019re seeing today and we\u2019re doing some things to mitigate the potential step up that could occur if we don\u2019t get through an agreement in March with China. That said, that\u2019s a pretty big unknown in terms of where that\u2019s going, so we\u2019re running through our own sort of scenarios. I\u2019d say to-date on the demand side we haven\u2019t seen any significant change. I would say both in the U.S. and in China, there were some concerns been expressed about whether this is going to be resolved, it hasn\u2019t translated into an impact on an extent on demand to-date, but I mean, should things get worse it potentially could. So we\u2019re trying to work through all of those potential scenarios to make sure we\u2019re positioned as well as possible to mitigate any impact. Greg Thaxton : And another comment I\u2019d layer in there, Matt, in some of our businesses, if you recall, we locally manufacture for that market. So I think that will help us avoid some of this impact. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, if you look at kind of the \u2013 can you give us a sense maybe outside of the mobile electronics space, what the pacing has been over the last 3-month period or so. I know you don\u2019t exactly give order rates, but a couple of quarters you would say orders were relatively flat, maybe up slightly, down slightly. Can you just give us a sense of how incoming order rates have looked as of late across the businesses at maybe a high level? Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say overall for the company the businesses is up relative to last year few percentage points. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve seen particular strength in our \u2013 in a number of our adhesives businesses in a variety of areas. We\u2019ve seen really strong in our fluid management businesses both our EFD product lines and our medical business in particular. I\u2019d say, most product lines we\u2019re seeing momentum that\u2019s positive going into the year. Greg Thaxton : And just to define that Matt, that\u2019s as we look at orders over the last 12 weeks and compare them to the same period of the prior year. Matt Summerville : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning guys. This is Brad on for Jeff. Mike Hilton : Good morning Jeff. Okay. Unidentified Analyst : Just on the backlog, look like the first total decline in quite some time, just talk about maybe some of the moving pieces there and what that might mean for the degree of weakness in the first quarter of next year, or any kind of higher-level thoughts about the magnitude there? Thanks. Mike Hilton : So just to be clear, you\u2019re talking about Q3 to Q4 or Q4 versus Q4? Unidentified Analyst : Q4 to Q4. Mike Hilton : Okay yes, the sole driver of that is really a large order, which we received last year in the electronics area so if you look past that, things would be up. Greg Thaxton : So just to expand on a little bit, you might not have followed this, but during our prior year fourth quarter, in our diversification efforts to expand where we deploy our technology, we had a nice win with an application in that electronic space that both generated upside that we had in our fourth quarter as well as was a big driver for a volume gain we had in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in that electronics a portion of advanced technology so a large portion of that order was still in backlog at the end of the fiscal year last year so that said, we talked earlier about kind of how we see the seasonality of the business progress, we still feel we\u2019re going to outgrow the economies that we operate this year and we feel pretty comfortable about the sort of 3% to 5% target we put out there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the capital allocation front, kind of level setting actually in the fiscal year here, how far would you say we are along with the underlying diversification strategy now specifically building out the medical piece and it looks like this year was a lot of fewer, smaller deals, is that what we should expect moving forward or is there maybe appetite or opportunity for some more sizable deal? Greg Thaxton : So, I think as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, the medical area still is fairly fragmented and they\u2019re both small and actually a few larger opportunities out there our capital priorities haven\u2019t changed, as it relates to acquisitions, the timing is hard to predict but we do see both smaller and some a few larger opportunities out there and should they come to market, we\u2019d hope we\u2019d have an opportunity to be successful there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay great thanks for the time. Greg Thaxton : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. I guess and forgive me if I missed it, but can you guys give any update or split as far as how polymer versus non-polymer has kind of performed with advanced dispensing? Mike Hilton : For this past year? Chris Dankert : Yes, and fourth quarter in particular. Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say they\u2019re probably pretty similar in the fourth quarter and no great difference there. Chris Dankert : And then as far as some of the domestic Chinese handset manufacturers, I guess, kind of, what are you guys seeing there, has there been a change in, in tenure, given some of the trade and that type of thing just any developments on the front outside of the big two handset manufacturers? Mike Hilton : No, I wouldn\u2019t say any change from what we\u2019ve seen throughout this year I think again, everybody seems to be working on the sort of 5G approach it was pretty quiet for all the handset manufacturers in terms of level of innovation in 2018 and everybody seems to be focused on 5G as a big deal and as I mentioned earlier, what isn\u2019t clear to us is, is that going to translate into handsets in \u201819 or is that going to be more of a \u201820 impact and quite frankly I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a clear view on that till probably that February-March time-frame that said, we\u2019re focused on the other things that I mentioned, continuing to diversify electronics outside electronics, growing all of our businesses through innovation, new products, new applications and we feel pretty good about where that pipeline is. Chris Dankert : Got it. And just one last one if I could, you mentioned medical was a strong grower in the quarter I guess, is that still kind of holding in the high single-digit, low double-digit organic rate here? Mike Hilton : Yes, it\u2019s very robust. Chris Dankert : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Trusz with G. Research. Your line is open. Matthew Trusz : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, if we think about at a high level, what you are seeing in global macro and how it\u2019s affecting your business could you sort of walk through how growth trends contrast between your key end markets like North America, China and Rest of Asia and are there any particular dynamics you\u2019re focused on, are you seeing like a China slowdown, Europe slowdown, any color there would be great? Thanks. Mike Hilton : So, let me just talk about this year and then we\u2019ll talk a little bit about the next year so this year the U.S. generally from the economic standpoint was better than the prior year, while Europe and Japan still grew, they were less than the prior year and China, it was about where it has typically been around that 6.5% so for us going into \u201818 that played out the way we thought sort of high 2% global GDP in the areas we operate so think about that as maybe 2.8% we are expecting next year to be a little lower than that overall, maybe 2.5% and we expect that we\u2019ll be able to grow at a multiple that drove the levers that we can pull, that\u2019s new products, new applications, things that we\u2019ve started to talk about like in athletic wear replacing taping and stitching with gluing we have seen some nice wins there we have talked about batteries for electric vehicles, we\u2019ve talked a little bit about aerospace Auto electronics continues to be a strong driver for us and then the tiering strategy has helped us grow in India it\u2019s giving us opportunities to grow in places like Vietnam, Thailand and through OEMs outside of China going to Africa so we focus on those growth initiatives that will allow us to drive growth over and above the GDP as I mentioned, we had these tough headwinds in \u201818, that shouldn\u2019t repeat at the same kind of level going forward. Greg Thaxton : Matt, I\u2019ll just make a couple of comments that kind of cut the other way if you think about some of the end markets that we sell into, like consumer non-durables, like medical, those tend to be more recession resistant end markets so not to say that we\u2019re immune to the impacts, but we get some strength because of the underlying drivers of some of these end markets that we sell into. Matthew Trusz : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust. Your line is open. Charlie Brady : Hi thanks. Good morning. I missed part of the call. So if you covered this let me know and I will just circle back with you. I am just wondering on the guidance, the move to annual guidance from the quarterly guidance typically you guys have said, your visibility just doesn\u2019t go out maybe beyond four months with any significant certainty and I\u2019m just wondering how that dovetails in with providing annual guidance right now as far as the confidence levels, doing that I mean, I understand the reasons behind it, but I\u2019m trying to understand really the confidence level of looking out 12 months as oppose just next quarter or so? Mike Hilton : Yes, thanks Charlie. Obviously, given our customer intimate model, we\u2019re pretty close to customers in the end markets, many of which are stable particularly on an annual basis and longer there is some instability in the shorter term, and that\u2019s really led to some of the noise that we\u2019ve talked about but when you look at things like core adhesives or even our polymer business where we tend to have longer lead times, we can look at backlog and get some confidence there and you look at our EFD product lines and our medical product lines, which are more a run rate kinds of businesses as our mix has changed over time, we\u2019re feeling a little bit more confident in that sort of annual guidance there and I\u2019d say, we also feel little more comfortable, because we don\u2019t have some of these headwinds that we had last year and as we look back historically, and one of the reasons we provided some of the additional historical data here as even in a really tough environment like last year we still be able to grow organically because of all the levers we\u2019re pulling around innovation and that\u2019s really given us some more confidence there and then in the short term, we can have a lot of stuff moving back and forth, but over a year and longer, we tend to be pretty consistent given some of the stability in the market and are closest with our customers. Charlie Brady : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And I am just wondering, I mean, I know you\u2019re not giving quarterly guidance, but advanced tech obviously with a 50% comp in Q1, can you just address maybe the magnitude of what that business might look like in Q1? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Charlie, I\u2019m probably not going to do that. I mean, obviously we got a tough comparison in Q1 as we said earlier, we\u2019re going to have a more seasonal year so it\u2019s, we\u2019re going to be down in Q1, that\u2019s but for the year, we feel pretty confident we\u2019re going to be able to deliver what we just talked about in that 3% to 5% top line organically. Charlie Brady : But are you expecting advanced tech to be up for the year despite the tough comp in Q1? Greg Thaxton : Yes. As I said, this is where I come back to, it\u2019s maybe hard to see underneath all of this, but our diversification efforts are really working within that segment and outside but in particular, we had a really strong year within electronics in our test and inspection, if you can\u2019t quite see that given the dispense headwinds but our EFD product lines and medical so things outside of the electronics did extremely well and we expect them to continue to grow and they\u2019ll grow at disproportionate rates relative to other parts of our business so we feel pretty comfortable on how we\u2019ve been able to diversify within and outside electronics so yes, we expect all businesses to be up for the year. Charlie Brady : Great. And one more from me, just on the commentary on the M&A back to one of the earlier questions, on the focus on medical just in terms of multiples, any change in any of those multiples on medical and I\u2019m just wondering, given that the fragmentation of that market and a lot of those deals are smaller, more niche here that maybe the multiples in that space are a bit less stretched and given you an opportunity to execute deals rather than other areas you might be looking into. Mike Hilton : So, I would say, the multiples kind of vary a little bit within the medical space, depending on the degree of differentiation and the growth prospects around the individual businesses but it\u2019s a space that has good growth prospects and high margins and so, it\u2019s still rich they are still rich, we\u2019ve been benefiting from that the last couple of years with what we\u2019ve been able to do and we feel like it absolutely fits well with our business model, our focus around customers, the drive for innovation, we feel pretty well positioned but there is areas where we\u2019d like to build out our capability and there are businesses out there that could help us do that we don\u2019t expect them to be discounted in any big way you might have some differences between small and large, but the market is robust in the areas where you have true differentiation and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Charlie Brady : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups. Are you willing to quantify the long-term savings potential you anticipate to see in ADS as a result of I am just going to call it kind of the manufacturing repositioning, as well as the uplift you would anticipate from the shared services implementation here in the U.S. and the ERP consolidation? Mike Hilton : I\u2019d say none at this point Matt. I\u2019d say, what we view \u201819 on the sort of adhesives piece is, we got passed all of the running multiple facilities and we\u2019re back into the right kind of operating framework I\u2019d say beyond \u201819, we should see both efficiencies but also capacity with better incremental margins and I think on our shared services piece, that\u2019s also where we see the benefit is growing at lower cost we will see some efficiency benefits, but the bigger driver is going to be able to scale with much lower cost so I\u2019d say not ready to quantify that yet or benefits in some in \u201819 but more beyond \u201819. Matt Summerville : And then just a follow-up on 5G, to your comment, Mike, is it a \u201819 or \u201820 sort of thing and in that context, I guess, what are you anticipating, what underpins your ATS, what\u2019s embedded in ATS in your guide in that regard. And then I guess the question is do you think this 5G equipment cycle as it pertains to Nordson could be bigger than the last couple of cycles you have seen in your mobile facing business. Can you frame that up a little bit? Thanks. Mike Hilton : So and the last part of the question, it\u2019s hard to tell at this point. We know that the approach will drive additional antennas and other types of things that will require a fundamental change in the phones. We don\u2019t have a feel yet for what that\u2019s going to translate into in terms of new equipment, it\u2019s early yet on that. Matt Summerville : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Mike Hilton for any further remarks. Mike Hilton : Thank you. And I just thank all of you for participating in today\u2019s call. And once again thank you to the Nordson organization who have delivered another very solid year for us, appreciate everybody. Take care and have good holidays everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

As a reminder, this call will be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, February 21, 2019, to report Nordson's fiscal year 2019 first quarter results. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until March 7, 2019, which can be accessed by dialing 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 707-8765. During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Hilton : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's 2019 Fiscal First Quarter Conference Call. We entered this year knowing we were facing a challenging comparison against 2018's outstanding first quarter performance, where we achieved organic sales growth of 19%. 2019's first quarter performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter and consistent with the typical seasonal pattern of sequential quarterly sales growth. Spending to support our business, selling and administrative expenses did not vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. Therefore, segment operating margins in the first quarter were impacted, as expected, by the lower sales volume. We expect sales each quarter to improve in line with our historic seasonality, allowing us to achieve our previously announced fiscal 2019 sales growth and margin guidance. During the quarter, we delivered on various continuous improvement initiatives, including further integration of operations into our North American shared service center and our adhesive facility consolidation within Europe and the U.S. In addition, during the quarter, we continued to execute our capital allocation strategy by investing $102 million for the repurchase of approximately 856,000 shares, and we distributed $20 million in dividends. I'll speak more about our fiscal '19 annual guidance in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed perspective on the quarter. Gregory Thaxton : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. First quarter sales decreased 10% compared to the prior year's first quarter. This change in sales included a decrease of 9% organic volume, growth related to the first year effect of acquisitions of 1% and a decrease of 2% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year's first quarter. First quarter's acquisitive growth includes the fiscal 2018 acquisition of Clada Medical Devices and two months of the fiscal 2018 acquisition of Sonoscan. As Mike noted, our first quarter performance was largely in line with our expectations as we were up against an exceptional prior year first quarter. Within the Adhesive Dispensing Systems segment, sales decreased approximately 4% compared to the prior year's first quarter, inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of approximately 2% and a decrease of approximately 3% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. We did deliver organic growth in most product lines. However, this segment's performance was offset by nonwoven product line sales, where system sales tend to be larger dollar and order patterns can be sporadic depending upon new OEM lines or customer line upgrades. As noted, we were up against very challenging comparisons within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, where prior year first quarter organic sales volume increased 50%. In the current year, first quarter sales decreased approximately 14% compared to the prior year's first quarter, inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of approximately 15%, an increase of approximately 2% related to the first year effect of acquisitions, and a decrease of approximately 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Double-digit growth within the fluid management product lines and solid growth within test and inspection product lines was offset largely by the difficult comparison for the dispensing product lines associated with electronic end markets. Industrial Coating Systems segment sales decreased approximately 10% compared to the prior year's first quarter, inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of approximately 9% and a decrease of approximately 2% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Softer demand for cold material product lines associated with automotive end markets had the largest impact as compared to the prior year. And like other larger-dollar system sales, demand can be lumpy for product lines within this segment. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 54% in the quarter. Operating profit was $84 million, with reported operating margin of 17%. Regarding the adhesive facility consolidation initiative that we have talked about in previous quarters, we incurred approximately $1 million of duplicate costs during the quarter. We do not expect duplicate costs to be material for the remainder of the fiscal year. In addition, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $1.5 million during the quarter, with most of this cost related to the adhesive facility consolidation initiative. As Mike noted earlier, operating margin for each of the segments was negatively impacted by lower sales volume in the quarter. We expect this year's performance to play out in line with historical seasonal patterns, where incremental sales generate significant margin leverage. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $49 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.83, inclusive of approximately $0.09 per share of charges related to onetime items. These onetime items include nonrecurring restructuring charges of $0.02 per share. Additionally, a net discrete tax charge of approximately $4 million or $0.07 per diluted share was recognized in the quarter, primarily related to the U.S. federal income tax reform legislation. We delivered first quarter EBITDA of $108 million or 22% of sales, inclusive of the $1.5 million of restructuring charges and approximately $1 million of duplicate costs associated with the adhesive facility consolidation. Free cash flow before dividends during the quarter was $43 million or 89% of net income. This cash conversion ratio is typical for our first quarter. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to EBITDA was approximately 2.3x trailing 12 months' EBITDA at the end of the first quarter, where we maintained adequate capacity for strategic priorities. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael Hilton : Thank you, Greg. As I mentioned earlier, our first quarter was in line with our expectations, where sales are typically the softest. Our spending is generally consistent from quarter-to-quarter, but we typically see an increase in the first quarter due to compensation increases. We expect to increase sales volumes sequentially as the year progresses, and we remain committed to our annual organic sales guidance -- growth guidance of 3% to 5% for fiscal '19. We've forecasted unfavorable currency effects of 2%. While we continue to monitor macroeconomic challenges and the ongoing trade discussions, our customer conversations are encouraging. The strength of our diverse end markets and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives across emerging markets, product innovation, new applications and tiering give us confidence in our target. The team also remains committed to achieving the operational improvements that support our previously announced operating and EBITDA margin enhancement target of 100 to 150 basis points over the fiscal 2018 performance. As always, thank you to our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support. With that, we pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : I just want to get back to Adhesive Dispensing. You talked about some project volatility there. Is it your sense? Is it just seasonality? Or does it still -- like there's something bigger with all the trade and macro concerns out there? Any thoughts? Michael Hilton : Yes. I'd say it's just typical, maybe not even seasonality, but just order patterns can vary year-to-year. Particularly, when you think of nonwovens or larger systems orders within that part of our core Adhesives business, when you look at it, our product assembly, our packaging and our polymer businesses were up and that one happened to be down, and that tends to be lumpy. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily seasonality, it's just a function of order patterns for our customers, and I wouldn't say it's related to any sort of larger macroeconomic trend. Allison Poliniak : Okay, great. And then kind of similarly with the technology piece or particularly electronics. Obviously, a really tough comparison. As you think about your -- how the year progresses, conversations relative to last year in terms of projects, are we still in a similar level there? Michael Hilton : Yes, we have good ongoing discussions. And as you know, we have development projects with a lot of our customers on the electronics side of things. We're getting to the point where in the next month or 2, we'll see whether those projects turn into real opportunities this year. It's kind of the time frame where customers make those decisions. I'd say, as we've talked in the past, we're seeing nice growth in things like the electronics area. The thing that's been the swing factor has been the mobile piece, and that's still not clear yet what this year looks like. But if you look outside the electronics business within that segment, we had a really strong first quarter in both our traditional EFD business and a very, very strong quarter in our medical business. We expect that to continue as we go throughout the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Charlie Brady with SunTrust Robinson. Charles Brady : [Indiscernible] on that last point on medical. Can you quantify how strong medical was in the quarter? Michael Hilton : Well, we expected that business to grow on a long-term basis, high single digit, low double digits, and it's -- it did that and a little bit more in the quarter. Charles Brady : Okay, good. And then I guess, just if I look -- I know you guys don't disclose the orders any longer, but as sort of our back-of-the-envelope calc, it looks like orders in the quarter were down about 2% on a maybe a 25% tough comp. Can you give any commentary and color? I suspect a lot of that was due to the -- on the ATS side. But just kind of order patterns or what you're seeing going into the current quarter, is that anything really -- as things flipped around particularly on the lumpiness of the nonwoven stuff. Michael Hilton : Yes. I would say for most businesses, we saw year-on-year order increases. Overall, probably, in the sort of low single-digit kind of rates. Our backlog is up 9%, but not all that's is going to get delivered in the quarter. So I'd say we're generally encouraged by what we see and are being consistent with the overall guidance that we provided. As you know, the system orders can be lumpy, not only in things like nonwovens, but also in some of our Industrial Coatings businesses and -- so that could vary quarter-to-quarter. But overall, we don't see anything that's inconsistent with what we think the overall top line should be for the year. Charles Brady : Okay. And then just to get one more from me. On the -- you commented about the automotive sector being a little bit weaker. Is that a function of just what we're seeing in North American auto market in terms of sales? Or is it just broader overall CapEx going into the plants themselves? Michael Hilton : Well, I would say, certainly, what you're seeing in North America is kind of a slowdown. But I'd say even around the world, you've not seen significant growth on the auto side. I think China in particular is probably a little bit flatter than it may have been over the last couple of years. So I'd say it's a sort of a global sort of auto story, not a -- necessarily a global investment story. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Christopher Dankert : Looking at the guide, you guys reiterated that today. Kind of assumes to get back to double-digit growth in ATS organically kind of through the rest of the year. Could you kind of walk us through kind of what gives you confidence? What the key drivers are there? Some of the new applications, maybe, automotive? Just kind of walk through what really gives you confidence in that guide in ATS. Michael Hilton : Well, I think if you look at the total segment, over half the segment now is nonelectronic. A significant portion of that is medical, which is growing very substantially. And even the general industry's piece is growing nicely, and we expect that to continue to grow. Within electronics, even though I made the comment just previously about auto electronics -- or about autos, the auto electronics piece is growing nicely. And if you saw the comments that Greg made around our test and inspection business, which hit a broader market in the electronics business compared to just the mobile segments, that was up nicely as well. So we're seeing some good opportunities that come from our diversification effort in the electronics and in the segment, in general, our broader diversification into medical. So we feel pretty good about the pace of business that we see here. As I just said to Allison, the sort of development work on the mobile piece is not as clear, but that's typically where we are at this time of the year. Christopher Dankert : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And I guess, given some of the headwinds we saw in the first quarter, is the target for the year still to get to that 30% margin within the Adhesive Dispensing, that ADS chunk of it? Michael Hilton : I think as I said last quarter, we think, ultimately, we can get to 30%. We didn't really commit that we'd get there this year because I think we needed to complete the restructuring efforts we were talking about and then ramp up the business and improve the efficiency in the polymer side. So I think ultimately, that's our goal to get there. I'm not committing that we're going to get there this year. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : So just a question on -- I guess, Mike, do you have a line of sight -- I heard your prepared remarks. But do have a line of sight at this point at all towards whether or not you think mobile innovation will be more of an on-year in fiscal '19 versus what was maybe a little bit more of an off-year in fiscal '18? And can you put the context in as to sort of what's embedded in the 3% to 5% organic guide for the year? Is it more of an on-year or more of an off-year, if you will? Michael Hilton : Yes. So what I would say, if you recall in some of the last conversations we talked about what would be sort of the next more significant driver in the mobile business, and we talked about things like 5G. In our mind, 5G is something that people are looking at this year, but probably won't see a broader implementation till next year. And that's kind of what we planned for, so not a significant step-up as associated with 5G. As far as other innovations that customers are working on, there are a number of things they're working on. We don't have a clear line of sight about which ones they're going to implement into sort of mass production for the next set of mobile opportunities. And that's why we continue to diversify across semi and across the auto electronics piece and generally across our test and inspection business as well. And we've been pretty successful in tiering to capture some of the other parts of the market. So I'd say it's not as clear yet on what degree of innovation our customers are going to see this year. There's announcements starting to come out, but it's really not clear yet in terms of what's going to go to mass production. Matt Summerville : And just as a follow-up. Across any of your businesses at this point, have you seen delays or deferrals in customer capacitization decisions, particularly in Asia due to either weak local demand in China or just due to the general trade uncertainty out there? Michael Hilton : I would say we haven't seen any kind of significant order cancellations or anything like that. I'd say there is some concern with regard to trade, particularly the trade discussions with China. And I would say that's top of mind for a lot of our customers. That said, the most recent news is encouraging. We'll see if that -- how that plays out. But I'd say there's -- we haven't seen anything significantly canceled, but I'd say there is a concern both in the U.S. and China on that. But to this point, it's not having a big impact on customer decisions. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then just a follow-up on medical. You indicated to answering another question that, that business was sort of growing organically above what you would otherwise normally expect. Can you talk about perhaps what's driving that? Is it market share related? Is it expanding that business internationally? Can you just provide some more granularity on that? Michael Hilton : Yes. It's really around kind of the heart of what drives all of our business, which is innovation. There is a lot of new products that are coming out in concert with new product introductions of our customers. And so across the -- most of the businesses, particularly the catheter businesses, the cannula and catheter businesses, we're seeing significant launches of new products to support customer growth, and it's a continued pipeline of innovation there. And as we've made the number of acquisitions that we've made, we've expanded our portfolio, which is giving us more access to customers that they look to have a more complete [indiscernible] to support them. So we're certainly seeing the benefit of that. So I'd say it's around innovation or is in customers, and it's around broadening that product portfolio and being able to take advantage of more opportunity. Operator : And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : It's nice to see that diversification reading through the electronics. I did have a question on coatings actually. In terms of the automotive exposure there, some companies are talking about reviving new platform launches in the industry after a slower 2018, independent of production. Just wondering if you concur? And to what degree that's a driver of your coatings automotive business? Michael Hilton : Yes. I would say to this point that hasn't translated into significant systems orders. I know there's a fair bit of discussion on that. But I'd say at this point, it's not translated into orders now. Just to keep in mind, this first quarter, particularly for a lot of the coatings customers, is a time frame where sort of at the end of January, they're finalizing all their capital plans. So it's not atypical for us to not see anything launched yet because they typically are calendar year and finalize their plans at the end of January or so. Christopher Glynn : Okay. But that does play to what -- how you serve those markets? Michael Hilton : Yes. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. And then overall, you commented on the quarterly was -- the first quarter was in line with your view of the year. But obviously, our sell-side models were -- uniformly didn't quite capture the seasonal deleverage all that well. So just wondering if any fine point considerations on how we view the split of the first half and second half? And really any wisdom on how the second quarter bridges to the full year, given that we kind of didn't quite manage all that well the first quarter with the change from quarterly to annual guidance? Michael Hilton : Yes, I would say that -- just a couple of things. First of all, I think the one thing -- I'll get to the top line comment in a minute. But the one thing that just to think through is knowing that we have sort of a seasonal business, our sort of sales and administrative costs don't typically vary tremendously throughout the year. So that's -- maybe it varies a few million quarter-to-quarter, maybe it's a little higher ultimately in the end of the year depending on how the year plays out. But it doesn't typically vary that much, which is great when we look at incremental volume and the incremental margins are going up. And obviously, if the volumes going down, unfortunately, that -- we see that as well. So I would say that's one thing to focus in on. Now on the top line, we would expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half. Obviously, first quarter is down, but we would expect to see seasonal growth in the second half of the year that would be stronger than we see in the first half. Our backlog, as I said earlier, is up 9%, but all of that's not going to go out in the quarter. So obviously, we expect to see improvement in the second quarter but more improvement in the second half of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt Trusz with Gabelli Research. Matthew Trusz : So within the mobile phone exposure, can you get a little more granular about what changes trigger a customer need for new Nordson equipment? So like for example, with waterproofing or 5G, there's a new hardware feature, or a fundamental change to form factor requires new gear. But when we're thinking about iterative type of model updates, does that really require much new Nordson equipment? Michael Hilton : So if you think about the things that drive it, it's change in general. So it could be shape factor in there, it could be something like making it thinner or expanding battery size, which squeezes everything else. That's been a benefit in the past. It could be features, things like the thumbprint recognition or any other type of sensing technology. Or it could be process changes, so waterproofing would fall into a process change. With 5G, the reason that we point to that is that it'll leave more antennas within the phone, and as a result of that, you're going to have less space. But as I said earlier, we don't really expect that to be a significant change until the -- until 2020. So it could be all of those things, including process changes in the way our customers manufacture the phones. So we have a variety of different things that we're working on there. Gregory Thaxton : Matt, this is Greg. What I'd add to that is, oftentimes, when we see a new feature finding its way into these devices, we get it -- we get the added benefit of we're often working at the module level with those suppliers, either with our dispensing equipment or our inspection equipment. And then working at the assembly level where the module gets integrated into the device. Michael Hilton : That said, one of things we continue to try to do, as I mentioned earlier, diversify across different applications, whether it's in the semi side, whether it's on the auto side, whether it's in the electric battery, batteries for electric car space. We're trying to diversify, so we're not as dependent there on the mobile phone space. Matthew Trusz : That's very interesting. And then just wondering, overall, how you would characterize your general level of business confidence and your sense of your customers' confidence, and whether your answer today would be any different than it would've been two quarters ago. Michael Hilton : Yes. I would say it's pretty consistent. I think as we talked last quarter, we expected global growth this year to be a little less than global growth last year. And so I'd say we're still seeing that is consistent. So I'd say it play out with our expectations. I mean, I think somebody asked earlier about trade, that's sort of the one wild card that's out there. If there was a significant trade war, well, then that would have some more implications. If the trade issues, particularly with China, get resolved in a positive manner, we could see some uptick there. But I'd say our view of the macro environment is where we thought it was going to be at sort of the tail end of last year, with growth globally but slower. And that's I think what we see today as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask -- try one on geographic basis. The Japan market's down. And I just wonder if you could -- if you can talk a little bit about the sectors that led to the decline in Japan. And kind of visibility, what would be the expectation because I think the comps get a little bit easier as you go on throughout the year. Michael Hilton : Yes. If you look at Japan, it's all year-over-year comparisons, Walt, and it was largely the significant electronics orders that we got that -- in the fourth quarter really of '17 that -- it also came in, in the first quarter of '18. And that happened to be through a Japanese supplier although the end customers for those products were across the portfolio of mobile as well as some other opportunities. So that's -- that really explains the -- what's going on in Japan year-over-year. And I'd say the first quarter in Japan is more typical than we expect in Japan as compared to last year. So won't read anything more into that other than just what I said now. I think we have said at the beginning of the year that we expect Europe and Japan to grow this year but slower than they did last year, and that's still our expectation. Walter Liptak : Okay. Okay, good. And yes, that was the next question, it's just doing the same thing in Europe. I mean, we've heard about European auto slowing, Germany. And I wonder what the visibility was like in Europe. And kind of the expectations. Those comps, I think, stay a little bit more difficult throughout the year. But what are your thoughts on some of the systems businesses in Europe? Michael Hilton : Yes. I would say it kind of lines up with the economy in terms of just a slower growth year. I mean, you see it in Germany, you see it in France, it's going to be a slower growth year. We'll see if Brexit has any particular impact. We don't expect it to have a big impact for us. But I think, in general, it's affecting the economies. We talked earlier about nonwovens. One of the big nonwovens OEMs happens to be located in Europe, so you could see some impact there depending on how that project level comes back throughout the year. But certainly, that's had some impact. Walter Liptak : Okay. So considering some of these international slowdown issues, when we think about the self-help that you're doing for this year and the margin improvement, what are the factors that provide that range of operating margin improvement? What does it take to get to the high end of that range? And what kind of assumptions go into the low end? Michael Hilton : Yes. Well, first of all, I think we've talked about the restructuring efforts we had underway in the polymer part of our Adhesives business. So we're essentially through that in this quarter, and we'll start to see some improvement as we go through the year. We also had some investment in setting up our customer service -- our shared service center activity in the U.S. that'll go away. So there's a -- some -- both expense that goes away and some benefits we'll see from finishing those projects. We have a number of things that we're driving on our continuous improvement activities through Nordson Business System that we think will help from the overall cost side. And then we do expect the volume to come in at the levels that we have talked about, and we'll get the volume leverage on that. So those are the major factors that would drive the margin improvement that we're looking for. Gregory Thaxton : Walt, this is Greg. One way that I'd characterize this is to say there's no one big aspect of this initiative that's going to deliver the bulk of it. It's going to be -- as we see across most of our years, it's a lot of singles and doubles that add up to generate this kind of improvement. Walter Liptak : Okay. And it sounds like the swing factor here is the volume leverage that -- a number of these things are within your control, but it's -- where does the revenue come in to get leverage off of that [indiscernible]? Michael Hilton : I mean you know our incremental margins are pretty high. So even with the -- sort of the 3% to 5% kind of growth targets that we've talked about, there's pretty good leverage on that. So you're correct. Gregory Thaxton : But some of those comments that Mike made kind of go hand-in-hand with the volume. The point here is as we grow that top line, we believe we're going to do it in a more efficient way because of some of these structural changes that we've made. Operator : And our next question comes from Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Jason Rodgers : Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the growth expectations by segment to reach your full year guidance. Does the guidance assume that you're going to realize some of these large system orders in nonwovens, in ADS? And then looking at the ATS segment, given that the mobile side possibly may not see robust growth until next year and then some slower growth regionally, I'm just looking for some more detail on areas of growth in addition to medical in that segment that can get you to the levels that you need to reach that 3% to 5%, your full year growth guidance. Michael Hilton : Yes. So what I would say is a couple of things : one, we do expect all of our segments to grow this year; two, within those segments, we probably have 25 to 30 different product lines. And in any 1 year, you're not going to have 100% of them grow, and we don't necessarily count on 100% of them growing. But as we look at the various drivers across each of the businesses, we feel confident enough in the things that we're doing with innovation, with new applications and products and taking advantage through our tiering structure of new markets that we're going to be able to generate that kind of growth that we've put out there. So I think all segments, we would expect to grow. But honestly, all product lines, but that's typical of any year that we have. Jason Rodgers : Okay. And looking at the share repurchase, stepped that up in the quarter. I wanted to get your thoughts on future repurchases. Michael Hilton : Yes. Well, let me start sort of the high. Well, our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. It's to support the organic growth of the business. It's to continue our dividend string. It's to look to add to our portfolio with appropriate acquisitions. And it's really done to be more opportunistic on the share repurchase. And that's what we've done in this past quarter in particular, as being opportunistic around the share repurchase. So end of day, that's still our priorities. And we feel like, as Greg mentioned, that we've got capacity to acquire some additional businesses. We've got a pipeline that we're working. But you never can tell when those things are going to come to market. So we maintain these priorities to appropriately allocate the capital for the greatest benefit to the company and our shareholders. Gregory Thaxton : And I'd add that in terms of part of that share buyback, part of our baseline strategy is to offset the dilutive effect of benefit plans. So we've been able to accomplish that with this activity. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey Hammond : So just wanted to come back to the non -- I guess, the areas where you're seeing lumpiness, I guess the nonwovens and then the pieces of coatings. Can you just talk about what you saw in terms of order activity in coating that kind of give you confidence you'll get maybe some good lumpiness back as you move through the year? Michael Hilton : Yes. What I would say is we've got activities going across all of those businesses and product lines around the globe. We just can't necessarily predict when customers are going to place orders. I would say, on the auto side, it's been softer for a while. And so we're not necessarily counting on that to step up in a big way. We have our normal run rate business that comes from our installed base there in the parts and consumables and smaller projects. I'm not sure that we're betting on significant large platforms to come through in the year. And I'd say, on the nonwovens, we've had really strong years over the last 3 or 4 years, and we'll continue to have some opportunities here this year. But it's kind of hard to place the timing on those things because they tend also to be also shorter delivery-type projects as well. What's important -- let me just add what's important is, as we -- as I mentioned earlier, we've got a lot of different product lines going into a lot of different markets and applications and this one is a little softer. We expect some others to pick up, and we've highlighted a few so far. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, great. And then just kind of back on the cadence question. As we head into 2Q, do you find 2Q kind of at least kind of falls into the range of the full year kind of growth guidance? Michael Hilton : Yes. So what we've said is we expect, sequentially, for things to pick up and the second half to be stronger than the first half and some improvement in the second quarter. So yes, we expect some positive improvement in the second quarter. But as we -- as I commented earlier, with our backlog up 9%, we don't necessarily expect that to translate into the quarter. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Hilton for any further remarks. Michael Hilton : I'd just say thank you to all of those who have participated today and continue to support Nordson. And thank you to our global team for continuing to delight our customers. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

One of Nordson\u2019s greatest strengths is the diversity of our end markets and our ability to execute on our growth initiatives. This was evident in the second quarter as we achieved total company organic sales growth of 3% with all three segments contributing organic sales growth. I will speak more about our fiscal 2019 annual guidance in a few moments. But first, I will turn the call over to Greg to provide some more detailed perspective on the second quarter. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike and good morning to everyone. Second quarter 2019 sales decreased less than 1% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. This change included an increase of 3% organic volume and a decrease of 4% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Growth in the quarter related to the first year effect of the fiscal 2018 acquisition of Clada Medical Devices was not significant. Within the Adhesive Dispensing Systems segment, sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter, inclusive of an increase in organic volume of 4% and a decrease of 5% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Growth was solid across most all product lines. Advanced Technology Systems sales decreased approximately 1% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Organic volume growth of 2% was offset by a decrease of 2% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation again as compared to the prior year. Double-digit growth within the Fluid Management product lines was offset by product lines serving electronics end-markets. Industrial coating system sales increased approximately 2% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. These results included organic volume growth of 4%, where growth was solid for most product lines and a 3% reduction related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 55% in the quarter. Operating profit was $129 million with reported operating margin of 23%. On a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing Systems delivered strong operating margin of 30% in the quarter. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, reported operating margin was 23% in the second quarter, which was in line with the prior year on lower sales. Industrial coatings segment reported operating margin of 22%, an increase of 340 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by volume leverage and improved sales mix. And as with performance in all segments, this segment\u2019s performance is also the result of continued emphasis on the Nordson Business System. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $92 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.58, inclusive of a $0.04 per share discrete tax benefit related to share-based compensation. We delivered second quarter EBITDA of $156 million or 28% of sales. Free cash flow before dividends during the quarter was $93 million resulting in cash conversion of 102% of net income. Our press release includes financial exhibits, reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to EBITDA was approximately 2.1x trailing 12-month EBITDA at the end of the second quarter. I will now turn the call over to Mike for a few closing comments. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. We continue to believe the diversity of our business, including geography, applications and end-market diversity, along with our ability to innovate and deliver on growth initiatives will allow us to achieve our long-term growth targets. As we look at the remainder of the fiscal year, we continue to forecast organic growth for the year though the impact of macroeconomic trend suggests our organic growth will likely be in the low single-digits for fiscal 2019. Based on current exchange rates, we still expect unfavorable currency translation effects of 2% compared to the prior year. With this sales outlook, we remain confident in our ability to generate approximately 100 basis points of operating and EBITDA margin improvement over the prior year as we continue to focus on continuous improvement throughout the businesses. As always, thank you to our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Chris Dankert : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Chris. Chris Dankert : I guess as we kind of move into the back half of the year here and into \u201820 can you just kind of breakout any kind of synergistic benefit from the plant consolidation. I know we have got some of the duplicate costs reduction maybe it\u2019s $6 million on fiscal \u201819, but just kind of what is the synergistic benefit beyond just removing those costs? Mike Hilton : Well, I think as we have said before, we expect to see some efficiency improvements as we go into 2020. We didn\u2019t necessarily expect to see them this year as we lined out all of the new equipment there. We haven\u2019t put a number on that yet. And so I think we are not really ready to do that, but we would expect to see some efficiencies in 2020 coming from optimizing operation as a result of the consolidation. Greg Thaxton : And Chris, this is Greg, I would add in 2019, that is part of the margin expansion we expect to see is as we kind of wind down the consolidation efforts, we expect to see some of that benefit in the current fiscal year. Chris Dankert : Got it. Got it, thanks. And then on the last call, you guys had mentioned we didn\u2019t need to see an upward inflection necessarily in mobile to kind of hit the prior organic guidance range. I guess kind of what\u2019s baked into the new range and just kind of how you are thinking about mobile particularly within that guide? Greg Thaxton : Yes, I would say, one of the things that\u2019s sort of affected us a little bit in this quarter and will affect the Q3 in particular is we really haven\u2019t seen our customers introduce any significant level of innovation into this cycle of phones. So we are not counting on that going forward for the rest of the year and quite frankly that has impacted our forecast and moving that down a bit. So for the rest of the year, we are not really counting on any kind of significant step up related to innovation in our customer base. Chris Dankert : Got it. Got it. If I could just sneak one in, on top of that I guess I don\u2019t expect so, but have you seen any impacts from kind of the Huawei tension, just any comment there would be helpful? Mike Hilton : I didn\u2019t catch the last part, what did you \u2013 of what you said there Chris, on the impact of... Chris Dankert : Apologies, just kind of impact from the tension between China and the U.S. as it relates to Huawei? Mike Hilton : I would say, in general, I think some of the slowness in our electronics equipment business is a function of just the current trade tension. So I think some people are holding off on investment. As it relates to Huawei, I think we will need to see how that plays out. Obviously, we have said before that the Chinese mobile players are our customers, so we will have to wait and see how that plays out. But again, we are not expecting a significant step up in any kind of innovation across the board in that segment for the rest of the year and that\u2019s been a key focus of bringing our guidance down. Chris Dankert : Understood. Thanks so much guys. I\u2019ll hop back in queue. Mike Hilton : Okay. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Drew Haroldson : Hey, good morning. This is Drew Haroldson on for Matt. First off, I am wondering... Mike Hilton : Good morning, Drew. Drew Haroldson : Good morning. First off, I am wondering what performance in ADS was between the four main buckets in the second quarter and what it\u2019s go forward outlook is? Mike Hilton : I would say across the core adhesives business, most of the businesses performed well. You know the non-wovens was still little softer, but we are starting to see some improvement from an order perspective there. So we are encouraged, I\u2019d say for the second half of the year across all of those product lines. And some of those like in the TPS area, our longer lead projects it will have more of an impact in the fourth quarter. Drew Haroldson : Got it. And then second off, I am wondering how the three individual segments compared to the low-single digit organic outlook for the whole company? Greg Thaxton : For the year, we still expect all of the segments to grow some marginally and some a little bit more, but we still expect them all to grow for the year. Individual product lines aren\u2019t likely to grow. So for example, our electronic systems product line is likely to be down. Drew Haroldson : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hi, good morning guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : So just to be clear on the guide, is the guide \u2013 the lower revenue guidance, is that isolated to the electronics piece or are there other areas of softness that you are seeing and maybe just within that speak to what you are seeing out of Europe and out of your automotive end markets? Mike Hilton : Yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s largely the electronics piece. Most of our other product lines are doing well and we expect them to continue to do well. Our run-rate businesses in particular like medical and EFD and our packaging businesses are particularly strong. The auto business is kind of choppy. It\u2019s been a drag for a couple of years. We don\u2019t see it having a big effect net-net on the year, although it was more of a drag in the first part of the year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just on the margin ramp, it looks like your margins were down a little bit 1Q, flat in 2Q and then you still think of a 100 basis point margin ramp. So can you just talk about how you ultimately get there given where you see incrementals to get to that number? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say if you look at it, there is a piece of that, that is related just to improving the performance in our polymer business and so eliminating some of that duplicate costs and some efficiencies there. And then our Nordson \u2013 through our Nordson Business Systems we have a bunch of projects that we are working on that are, I would call in the singles category, so projects that generate several hundred thousand dollars a year of improvement. So that maybe through automation and maybe using our ability to in-source some things that we outsource, there is a variety of things at each of the businesses that when you add them all up are significant. And so it\u2019s really driving the Nordson Business System piece along with improvements in our polymers business. Greg Thaxton : And then Jeff, this is Greg. Of course, the volume growth will generate some with an incremental that we generate on that volume. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just you mentioned in Electronics, I think if you look, I think you had the really tough comp in 1Q, and I think that comps get easier into 3Q, but maybe just talk about cadence in that tech business as you see it into the back half of the year? Mike Hilton : Yeah. So, I think when we look at the next quarter with my earlier comments, we really haven\u2019t seen innovation on the customer side. The electronics piece is going to continue to struggle in the fourth quarter or in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter there is maybe some easier comps, but maybe just some commentary on the overall company looking through the rest of the year. We expect Q3 to be up modestly from a revenue perspective and we expect Q4 to be up more substantially, and the Q4 I think Q3 piece is really continued drag from electronics. The Q4 piece is really a function of long lead projects that we already have in-house or expect to come in, in the near future. And then our, the strength of our run rate businesses which would include things like medical, our EFD business and our packaging business, so that combination gives us some comfort that we\u2019ll see a stronger fourth quarter that ultimately when you integrate them across the year, gets us to that sort of overall low single-digits. Greg Thaxton : And Jeff, I\u2019d just add a little commentary. In a year where it plays out as Mike suggested where we don\u2019t have the innovation in the electronic end markets you would typically see our fourth quarter being stronger, the strongest quarter in the fiscal year. So it kind of plays out that this is in line with that type of year and as Mike characterized, you\u2019re likely to see continued growth as we move through the year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. So, there\u2019s a step up in growth in all the segments into the fourth quarter or would that be isolated events? Greg Thaxton : No, not just event stack, I mean we see real strength in the as I said in those run rate businesses. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about that medical has been particularly strong. Key parts of our EFD business we expect it to be strong. Our packaging business has been really solid. We have long lead orders in place in things like our coatings and our polymer business that gives us some comfort and then we are seeing some improvement in the near-term in our non-wovens business. So that combination I think is helpful. And then, outside of the dispense side and the electronics piece; the other parts of the business are solid. So that\u2019s the sort of the combination that when you look at it, adds strength to the fourth quarter and the electronics piece is probably a bit of a drag in the third quarter still. Jeff Hammond : Okay, excellent. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning guys. Greg Thaxton : Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Walter Liptak : So, wanted to ask about Huawei directly, so I don\u2019t think, one of these calls we\u2019ve ever talked about a specific customer. And I know you sell to the mobile device makers and some of the Chinese mobile phone companies become more important over the last few years. But I wonder if you can give us some insight into what\u2019s happening. You have a fair amount of business out of China and obviously with trade war and a lot of the things that are in the press right now. I wonder what your view is on how that\u2019s impacted the business in the quarter and what that might do you know in the coming quarters. Mike Hilton : So, I\u2019d say at a high level, Walter, we do think, and if you look at our geographic numbers, they\u2019re down in Asia. We do think that the trade issues back and forth are creating some delay in investment in Asia. A lot of that linked to the electronics part of the business. From a mobile perspective, in general, as we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s not been a year with a lot of innovation, where it had some promise in the beginning year that\u2019s really not played out. I think as we said before, we support all of the larger and the Chinese players. So, I\u2019d say there is some concern with the latest sort of rounds of discussion and even last night there has been some relaxation as it relates to Huawei. But no one customer is significant enough that kinds of drive what we see going forward. And so, our forecast is assuming pretty modest year from a mobile business, in general. So, we\u2019re not counting on it. Does this do these tensions make it potentially worse? It could. I mean, we\u2019re trying to account for that, but it could. Walter Liptak : Okay, okay. And the comments about innovation, I wondered if you can just go a little bit deeper on that. I know in the past, we\u2019ve talked about 5G, and it seems like 5G is moving forward in some parts of the world. What do you think the timing is of that and what other kind of innovation were you thinking could be happening that maybe has pushed out a little? Mike Hilton : Yes, so we typically work on a lot of projects from the November through sort of the February timeframe, and typically, some of those go forward in a year where you see significant changes in models. You see a lot of that being incorporated in a year where it\u2019s pretty incremental. You don\u2019t see as many. I\u2019d say this is the year, we haven\u2019t seen much at all in the way of innovation, and I think some of that\u2019s related to just sort of a lower demand for mobile phone. Some of that is, I think, related to the trade issues that are ongoing right now. So, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of new investment incorporated into innovation. As it relates to 5G, there are headline news out there around 5G and 5G capable phones. But really, there\u2019s not much incorporated in the phone at this point. The driver for that is going to be less on the phone side and more on the infrastructure side for 5G to work effectively and get the benefits of it, you need a lot more localized infrastructure in place. So that\u2019s going to play out from \u201820 through 2021 and beyond, because the range of 5G is very short and so you need a lot, more physical antennas outside. And then, within the phones, you need fairly significant changes. So, I think it\u2019s 2020 and beyond in terms of having a real impact and it\u2019s going to be somewhat linked more to the broader infrastructure play. Now there is some opportunities for us in that infrastructure play too, but these are these require high density transmission towers, not like we necessarily have today you can hang all this stuff on a lamppost and everything else. But it\u2019s an investment that has to happen and until that happens; you\u2019re not really going to get a benefit on the phone side. So, I\u2019d say, while you see you see advertised 5G, in effect I think even some of the U.S. phone companies had to withdraw their comments because they\u2019re not really 5G at this point. Walter Liptak : Okay. Okay, thanks for that. And then, just one last follow-on from one of Jeff\u2019s questions about Europe, the volume growth of 4.6% looked very good and I wonder if you could talk about any of the trends that are going on there, either by segment or because we hear about EU slowing in Brexit and maybe anything on like a new orders or front logs that can help us understand what the trends are like? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say if you look at the European in general coming into the year, we thought it was going to be a pretty modest growth year maybe a little bit less than last year from a broader economy. I think that\u2019s in fact what\u2019s playing out although there was some more encouraging news most recently, I think out of Germany. For us, it\u2019s really a function of specific parts of our, business like Packaging that continue to remain solid. What we expect overall for Europe for Europe to be a modest growth year from an economic perspective. Walter Liptak : Okay. Okay, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question is coming from the line of Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review. Your line is now open. Jason Rodgers : Yes, so I did have one follow-up on the, on the mobile side, just wondering, based on your past history, if you\u2019ve seen back-to-back years were mobile customers did not innovate, just thinking about next year, the outlook for the mobile side. Mike Hilton : Yes. So, what I would say is this is a little atypical because you typically haven\u2019t taken a tack here as they describe it and we really saw last year being relatively incremental and this year being fairly weak. And I do think the trade side of that is having an impact. And I think it\u2019s affecting overall demand and then investment for it. So, I think that\u2019s unusual. I do think Walt\u2019s prior question around 5G is what\u2019s going to be the next big driver around mobile. For us, the other thing that we have been doing is diversifying our business within the electronic space and doing more and more for example, in auto electronics and in the semiconductor side as well as driving growth in the non-electronics pieces in general industry and the medical side and that certainly helped \u2013 that overall segment helped in the quarter and will help for the year, because the other things, those run-rate kind of businesses are doing well. Jason Rodgers : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Mike Hilton for closing remarks. Mike Hilton : Thank you. And I thank everyone for participating on today\u2019s call. Just as one final summary point, we do expect to grow this year as we have said low single-digits. We do expect to improve our margins 100 basis points. So, despite some of the challenges that are out there from a macro perspective and some of the industry-specific challenges, the diversity of our business is going to allow us to grow and improve margins this year. And I want to thank all of our team for being focused on delighting customers and making that happen. So thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nordson Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Lara Mahoney, you may begin your conference. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Lisa. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Today, I am joined by Sundaram Nagarajan, Nordson\u2019s new President and CEO; Mike Hilton, Senior Advisor to the company and Former President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, August 21, 2019 to report Nordson\u2019s fiscal year 2019 third quarter results.Our conference call is being broadcast live on our new Investor Relations webpage at investors.nordson.com and it will be available there for 14 days there will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until September 4, 2019, which can be accessed by dialing 416-621-4642. You will need to reference ID number 5937809.During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance, based upon Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the Company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions.With that, I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike Hilton : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2019 third quarter conference call. Before we discuss the financial results, I\u2019d like to welcome Naga to the call. Naga joined us as President and Chief Executive Officer on August 1, 2019 just about three weeks ago. He joins us following 23-year career with ITW. We are very pleased to have him join the company. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Mike. It\u2019s an honor to join Nordson. And on behalf of the Nordson colleagues around the world, I want to thank you for your leadership over the past 10 years. I appreciate the opportunity now to lead this talented team and thank Mike and our Board of Directors for trusting me with this position. I am starting to travel to our sites to get to know the business and I have had the opportunity to meet individually with members of our leadership team. Throughout my career, I have thrived in driving growth and profitability by focusing on the customer while prioritizing innovation and talent developments. Similarly, Nordson\u2019s focused on customer passion and innovation as resulted in a market leading enterprise, strong track record of growth and solid profit margin. I\u2019m using my first 90 days, to listen and understand the opportunities that will drive Nordson\u2019s next chapter of growth. I also look forward to meeting with our shareholders and analysts. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Naga. We\u2019re very glad to have you on the team. Now turning our attention to the third quarter, the ongoing uncertainty related to international trade disputes it\u2019s continuing to influence customer investments in new technology and capital. This challenging macro economic environment is lasting longer than most expected and as a result capital projects have been delayed and we have had a weaker third quarter than we originally anticipated. The softness in product lines serving electronics end markets and those within the Industrial Coatings Segment offset solid organic growth from our Adhesives Dispensing segment and the non-electronics product lines within the Advanced Technology.Also during the quarter within Industrial Coating Segment, some customers move deliveries into the fourth quarter. So we expect to deliver a strong top line results for this segment in the fourth quarter. Throughout this period our team has been focused on executing continuous improvement initiatives and managing costs. As a result, they held third quarter operating margin, equal to the prior year, but adjusting for one-time charges in both years. Despite the decline in total company sales during the quarter as well as the pressure and distraction from tariffs.I will now turn the call over to Greg to provide a more detailed perspective on the third quarter. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike and good morning to everyone. Third quarter 2019 sales decreased 4% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter. This change included a decrease of 2% organic volume and a decrease of 2% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Growth in the quarter related to the first-year effect of the fiscal 2018 acquisition of Clada Medical Devices and the 2019 acquisition of Optical Control was not significant. Within the Adhesive Dispensing Systems segment sales increased 2% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter inclusive of an increase in organic volume of 4% and a decrease of 2% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Growth was solid across most all product lines.Advanced Technology Systems sales decreased 5% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of 4% and a decrease of 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, again, as compared to the prior year. Double-digit growth in medical product lines was offset by softness in product lines serving electronics end markets. This is largely the result of minimal customer innovation coming to market in 2019, as well as the tension related to the ongoing trade dispute. Industrial Coating Systems sales decreased 18% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter. These results include a decrease in organic volume of 17% and a decrease of 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. As Mike noted, the timing of system shipments can impact quarterly results and we expect strong fourth quarter volume growth within this segment.Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 54% in the quarter. Operating profit was $130 million with reported operating margin of 23%. These results include $1.2 million for one-time restructuring charges and a charge of $200,000 for the one-time step up in the value of acquired inventory. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter, excluding these one-time charges was 24% equal to the prior year\u2019s third quarter adjusted operating margin also exclude one-time charges. Again this is strong operating performance in the quarter against the challenging macro environment. On a segment basis Adhesive Dispensing Systems delivered strong operating margin of 31% in the quarter, we\u2019re pleased to see the progress the team is making to drive margins within this segment. Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment reported operating margin was 21% in the third quarter, down from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume. The Industrial Coating Systems segment delivered operating margin of 19%. This team has worked hard to make sustainable improvements to its operating performance and we are pleased to achieve this level of performance despite weaker sales in the quarter.On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $94 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.62. We delivered third quarter EBITDA of $158 million or 28% of sales. Our press release includes financial exhibits, reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends, as well as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt-to-EBITDA was approximately 2.1 times trailing 12 months EBITDA at the end of the third quarter.And I will now turn the call over to Mike for a few closing comments. Mike Hilton : Thank you, Greg. As I reflect on our expectations at the beginning of the year. The effect of recent macroeconomic trends has had more significant impact than anticipated, especially with the trade dispute continuing longer than most had expected. Many of our end markets, such as those within adhesive segment and the medical portion of the Advanced Technology have held up well despite these pressures, but some customers are certainly more cautious with capital investment during these uncertain time. With the full year, we now expect flat to modest organic sales growth and unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately 2% on sales as compared to the prior year. We will remain focused on continuous improvement initiatives to offset costs and the weaker expected sales growth to hold or modestly improve operating margin and EBITDA margin compared to the prior year. The macroclimate underscores the importance of our diversification strategy.Despite the weakness in the electronics end markets, I am pleased with the solid organic growth in our Adhesives Dispensing segment and the non-electronics product lines with Advanced Technology segment during the quarter. Expect that growth to continue. We also expect a strong fourth quarter from our Industrial Coating segment based on our current backlog. We will continue to look for opportunities to diversify our business. On July 1, we announced the acquisition of Optical Control, a Germany based designer and developer of high-speed fully automatic accounting systems using X-ray technology. This product line expands Nordson\u2019s test and inspection capability for electronics customers. I\u2019d like to formally welcome the Optical Control employees to the Nordson team. The strength of Nordson\u2019s position as a valued solutions provider to our customers combined with the diversity of our end markets gives us confidence that we will continue to drive organic growth going forward. We also remained focused on delivering value to our shareholders earlier this month we announced a dividend increase of 9%. This marks the 56 consecutive year of annual dividend increases, ranking us 14 among publicly traded companies for the longest-running record of annual dividend increases. We take pride in returning a portion of our cash flow to our shareholders.Before we move into Q&A, I\u2019d like to take this moment that is my \u2013 as it is my last conference call, to thank our shareholders, analysts, employees and customers for their support over the past ten years. We\u2019ve entered new markets and grown this business while holding true to Nordson\u2019s core values of integrity, back for people customer passion and excellence and energy. It\u2019s been an honor to lead this great Company. I know Naga and Nordson\u2019s strong leadership team will continue to enhance the company\u2019s great legacy. I will continue to work with Naga to ensure a smooth transition. To start to see him Greg and Lara on the road meeting with the investment community and I\u2019m pleased to pass the torch to him.With that, we pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Mike Hilton : Good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Welcome, Naga and best of luck Mike. I just want to go to ICS for a second. You know, I know the customer delays and push outs aren\u2019t uncommon in it. Any color around those push outs, any ability to quantify it. And then I guess any risk that they don\u2019t execute in Q4. Mike Hilton : As I say there is nothing really unusual about that I\u2019d say we\u2019ve had some large projects that we are ready to go in the quarter and customers just moved them back a little bit. So they\u2019re all in execution now and will be delivered in the quarter. So we expect to see as we said a strong quarter there. So there\u2019s nothing unusual or underlying that other than just some movement of larger orders into the fourth quarter. Allison Poliniak : Okay. Perfect. And then the growth reduction, I know you guys were looking at the mobile \u2013 the mobile Fed and some of the electronics, that\u2019s not a surprise. I guess what area I guess drove down that growth target for the year. Mike Hilton : I would say, most all of that falls into the electronic space. If you think back to where we were in the second quarter the electronics industry in general is expecting a recovery in the second half that\u2019s really not playing out. And we were working on a number of specific mobile projects that given the grade disputes essentially all of them have been put on hold. So I\u2019d say the area that really has driven the shortfall has been those delays in the capital spending around electronics and in particularly affecting our dispense business there. Allison Poliniak : Alright. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Hey, thanks. Just echo Allison\u2019s comments, welcome Naga, and Mike it\u2019s been great working with you. Just \u2013 besides the electronics market\u2019s continuing softening, I\u2019m wondering if any other area is starting to get tougher to 10 down, it doesn\u2019t look like anything in the quarter really. But as you\u2019re looking at things in real time. Any other demand patterns frame? Or is still pretty solid? Mike Hilton : No, I would say if you look at sort of our Adhesive Dispensing segment, that\u2019s running along at a nice pace, kind of what we would expect. Our medical business is very strong. Our business in Advanced Technology outside the electronic space is solid. I think when we look at the end of the year we\u2019ll see a nice recovery in the coatings business in this fourth quarter. Let\u2019s say even within electronics our test and inspection business is holding its own, the one that\u2019s been most affected significantly is the dispense side of things, and that\u2019s really kind of been the key driver in the short term. So I\u2019d say the run rate businesses are doing strong we\u2019ll see an improvement in coatings in the next quarter. And we\u2019re really it\u2019s not expecting the electronics piece to be a drag in the next quarter, so I\u2019d say nothing else, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 in general, if the trade dispute gets worse, you could see some pull back on overall capital spending. We\u2019re not seeing that yet. Christopher Glynn : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you for that. And on the guidance were flattish margins for the year are a little better, the first nine months were down each quarter obviously, but implies maybe near record segment margin performance since after the first polymer deals, wondering if you\u2019re seeing a clear path radius to have the best organic growth and margin rate of the year because, you kind of back into that with the full-year company outlook? Mike Hilton : Well, we do expect volume to go up in the fourth quarter across most all of the businesses and we \u2013 yes, we have seen improvement coming from our polymer business as we talked about, we expected to see elimination of most of the duplicate cost this year. We have the facilities, running at good operating rates, but we would expect next year to see some additional improvement. So, I think we are in a good spot on the Adhesive segment at this point. Christopher Glynn : Sounds great. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning. Couple of questions. First, can you talk about, sort of, there\u2019s a follow-up to Chris\u2019 question. The annualized savings you anticipate to generate from the manufacturing or footprint optimization that you\u2019ve completed a couple of quarters back in the Adhesive Dispensing segment beyond kind of the elimination of the duplicate of cost that you mentioned, Mike? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say, Matt, for this year we didn\u2019t expect to see much beyond the elimination of those cost, what we\u2019ve said as we get the new facility up and running and the equipment all-lined out given our investment in sort of newer technology in the equipment as we load those facilities, we\u2019d expect to see some efficiency gains. We haven\u2019t specifically quantify that. I think historically we\u2019ve gotten questions around, can we get back \u2013 as segments back on an annual basis to 30% margins or above and we said we think we can do that. So obviously that improved performance would be part of that, but this year we weren\u2019t necessarily counting on \u2013 a big step-up due to the efficiency there as we lined up this. Matt Summerville : Just as a follow-up and two things. First, in the past, I know you don\u2019t comment numerically, specifically, on incoming order rate, but you\u2019ve been willing to give at least some sort of year-over-year color if you\u2019re able to do that regarding the three businesses, what you saw through the quarter perhaps even kind of a monthly cadence whether things got better or got worse, stayed the same. And then lastly, Greg, can you just comment on your free cash flow performance this quarter versus the year ago period and maybe parse out why it was down quite a bit? Thank you. Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say overall as you look progress through the quarters order rates improved a little bit, not dramatically, but improved a little bit. So, I\u2019d say our combination of what we see in our run rate businesses plus the backlog and some recent orders in our coatings business in particular, gives us some confidence in the fourth quarter volume growth we expect to see. But I\u2019d say modest improvement but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that throughout the quarter. Greg Thaxton : Yes, Matt on the free cash conversion will have this in different quarters in the year it\u2019s really a combination of two things related to working capital. It\u2019s the timing during the quarter of when we ship some larger system sales. So, if they occur in the back end of the quarter, they are still setting in receivables. And it\u2019s also, I\u2019d say, more so related to an inventory build as we gear up for expected strong fourth quarter. So, it\u2019s working capital related and I would expect that when we get to the end of the year, we\u2019ll be back at that 100% conversion rate. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi, good morning, guys. Mike Hilton : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Congrats, Mike, for a great tenure and Naga, welcome aboard. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Jeff Hammond : So just we have a couple of a, couple of things. If we can just go back to the Coating, I was trying to pin down is there a way to quantify how much revenues could move from 3Q to 4Q. Just as we try to size the growth rate in the 4Q? Mike Hilton : Not specifically. But what I would say, Jeff, as we wouldn\u2019t have called it out if it wasn\u2019t substantial amount of revenue that was moving in some large shipments. So, it wasn\u2019t incidental. Greg Thaxton : And Jeff, this is Greg, I would add to that, it\u2019s both the timing of some of those orders in terms of when they ship, but I think for this segment we have to remember that we\u2019re often talking about larger dollar system sales. So, it\u2019s also the timing of when we get those orders and, in the quarter, that they\u2019re going to ship. So it\u2019s the comments that we\u2019re trying to provide is to suggest that although in the third quarter alone with volume down in the direction that it was, it is we\u2019re trying to suggest that it\u2019s, that\u2019s not really the flow of the demand that we\u2019re seeing within that segment and when you balance what we expect to deliver in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to get you back to call it normalized performance. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Greg Thaxton : But what we would say is the fourth quarter probably going to be a record in that particular segment. Jeff Hammond : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then Mike, I think you said, electronics, you didn\u2019t expect to be a drag in the fourth quarter. And then just this is kind of better Adhesive spend, a little more, quite and challenging this year. So just give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing that gives you confidence that we see some kind of uptick or that it doesn\u2019t continue to be a drag? Mike Hilton : Yes, I would say, part of that is a function to be frank of comparable with last year part of that is a function of, so the steady-state part of that business, there is a steady-state part of the business. The test inspection business has been pretty steady. And so really, I\u2019d say it\u2019s not that we\u2019re looking for a big uptick. We just don\u2019t see it going down any more. Greg Thaxton : Of course, we\u2019ve got the stability of the non-electronics portion of the business within the Advanced Tech segment that helps that growth. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just last one on the Advanced Tech. The margins, you were brought [ph] down pretty substantially, I think your incremental were pretty close to 100%. But just give me a sense and I think you said it was really just volume driven, but is that just mix rich business that is going away? Or is there something else going on there that\u2019s driving the steeper margin decline? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I think we heard all that, Jeff. What I would say is first the volume does have an impact in the short term. Secondly, particularly within the electronics part of the business or dispense business, as I said is down substantially and that business tends to carry higher margins than our test and inspection business largely because we make more of the specific components for that business [Technical Issues] versus purchasing some on the test inspection side. So those two are, I\u2019d say the biggest contributors to what we\u2019re seeing there, volume piece and the mix. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thanks. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everyone. This is Pat, on for Mike. Sundaram Nagarajan : Hi, Pat. Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : I was hoping to maybe get a little bit more color going back to the margins, so we have the moving pieces with ICS, some of the cost initiatives. You could maybe help us, directionally by segment, it feels like maybe we\u2019re expecting a little bit of nonwovens improvement and then also some EPS. Could you maybe help us bridge the gap a little bit there working into 4Q and some of the puts and takes there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Well, I would say overall, we expect for the year to be kind of flat to modestly up as what we\u2019re thinking here. Part of that improvement is going to come in the fourth quarter as our volume improves and we\u2019ll get leverage on that volume. As we\u2019ve talked about our run rate businesses have been solid, and we\u2019ll see some improvement in the coatings business as well. We\u2019ve been working very hard on our continuous improvement initiatives in part to try and offset the impact of the volume decline but also the deal with the grade issues that bring tariffs into play. So, when you look at that overall in the Adhesive side, specifically to your question around nonwovens, the overall segment is growing, as we\u2019ve talked about in this quarter, particularly strong in packaging and product assembly, nonwovens, is off a little bit but in aggregate, solid growth in a tougher macroeconomic. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Sundaram Nagarajan : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question here. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Chris Dankert : Looking at advanced technology from at the high level here, obviously, I think 5G is top of mind for a lot of people. Obviously, flex, circuitry is another driver, albeit a bit lumpy. But when we think about innovation that could drive change and long-term revenue growth for Nordson, I guess beyond 5G and flex, what else going to get excited in that business from a high level? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. I would say what we see continued growth around is all electronics that will particularly, as we talked about in the past, be associated in the short term, with a lot of measures that are put in place from a safety perspective and longer-term it supports the movement to autonomous driving. We\u2019re also seeing an increase on the electric vehicle side and so particularly the battery technology although the penetration of electric vehicles is modest, but in the long run, that\u2019s going to improve and create some opportunities.And we do see some opportunities coming from 5G, we think that\u2019s going to play out over a number of years because of the need to build on the infrastructure piece to really make that effective the phone piece won\u2019t be the gating item, it will be the infrastructure piece that will be the gating item. And then longer term, there is probably some additional opportunity around all of the [Technical Issues] and so forth. I think as we look at our diversification in the segment test and inspection part is growing nicely and it taps into a lot of different markets. So, we feel good about that balance. And then obviously the balance outside of electronics [Technical Issues]. So, I\u2019d say there are longer-term growth drivers, some of which plan to medical a lot which mobile. So, we\u2019ll see those on the horizon of some drivers. Chris Dankert : Got it. Got it. And then just kind of a follow-up on that team I guess what inning do you guys think we are in terms of tearing inside of Advanced Technology here? Sundaram Nagarajan : I\u2019m sorry, what they want? Tearing. Chris Dankert : The tearing? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I would say if you look at that applies, mostly to the electronics parts of our business, but there are some in the non-electronics parts as well. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got a pretty broad portfolio in both expense and the test inspection side and involves a significant tearing probably four to six levels of offering now. A lot of those are just relatively new being introduced in the last year or so. And I\u2019d say, if we look at things like our valve portfolio in our EFD business, we\u2019ve got a full stack with some possibilities to continue to develop that. I think we\u2019re very well positioned as customers move from manual semiautomatic operation into automated operation in those businesses. So, I think we\u2019re well positioned in the short term, I think we\u2019ve seen a pause here significantly related to the ongoing trade dispute. Chris Dankert : Got it. Got it. Makes sense. Thanks guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in queue. I will turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks. Mike Hilton : Thank you. And again, thank you for your support. We\u2019ve talked about some short-term macroeconomic challenges. But I think what you\u2019ve seen is the diversity of our end markets, our focus on customer solutions have allowed us to continue to have opportunities for growth and improved margins over the long run and in the short run, our run rate businesses have done well and we expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter and some of our other businesses. So, we\u2019re, I\u2019d say encouraged in a difficult market, the diversity of our business as positioned us well. Thank you again for your support and we appreciate your time and attention on this call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Lisa. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I am here with Sundaram Nagarajan, Nordson's President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, December 12, 2019 to report Nordson's fiscal year 2019 fourth quarter and year end results.Our conference call is being broadcast live on our Investor Relations webpage at investors.nordson.com, and it will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until December 26, 2019, which can be accessed by dialing 416-621-4642. You will need to reference ID number 1057927.During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance, based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions.With that, I will turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2019 fourth quarter conference. I would like to begin by recognizing the Nordson's team for a strong performance against a challenging macroeconomic environment in 2019. Throughout my Nordson's site visits over the past four months, I've been very impressed by our passion for our customers. We're focused on serving our customer's critical needs, and creating precision technology solutions that bring differentiated value to our customer's businesses. Our focus on the customer, combined with the diversity of our end markets and applications continue to help us during these challenging macroeconomic times.For the fourth quarter, we generated solid organic growth of 4%. For the full year 2019, total company organic sales were down 1%, as compared to last year, where organic growth in both Adhesive Dispensing and Industrial Coating segments was offset by softness in electronics end markets served by the Advanced Technology segment. For the total company on a full year basis, we maintained operating margin and EBITDA margin in line with prior year despite lower sales, the distraction from tariffs.I'll speak more about our fiscal 2020 annual guidance in few moments, but first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton to provide more detailed perspective on our financial performance. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. Fourth quarter 2019 sales increased 3% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. Change included an increase of approximately 4% organic volume, growth of less than 1% related to the first year effect of the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Optical Control, and a decrease related to the unfavorable effect currency translation of approximately 1%. Within the Adhesive Dispensing Systems segment, fourth quarter sales increased 1% compared to the prior year, inclusive of a 3% organic growth, and a 2% decrease related to the unfavorable effect of currency translation as compared to the prior year. This segment continues to benefit from the stability of consumer non-durable end markets as well as our growth initiative.Advanced Technology System sales decreased less than 1% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter, inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of less than 1%, an increase of 1% related to the first year effect of acquisitions, and a decrease of 1% related to the unfavorable effect of currency translation as compared to the prior year. The fourth quarter's acquisitive growth includes the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Optical Controls. Strength in medical end markets was offset by weakness in electronic end markets.Industrial Coating system sales increased 21%, compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. As discussed during our third quarter conference call, strong backlog entering the fourth quarter and solid order activity during the quarter drove organic volume growth of 22%. The unfavorable effect of currency translation negatively impacted sales by 1%, sales for the segment was a record quarter, and I'd like to thank the team for their efforts.Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was approximately 54% in the quarter. Operating profit was $140 million, an increase of 20% compared to prior year, and operating margin was 24% as compared to 21% in the prior year's fourth quarter.On a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing System segment delivered strong operating margin of 31% in the quarter, which is an increase of approximately 350 basis points as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. We are seeing the benefit of the facility consolidation efforts in Germany and Austintown, Ohio, as well as some improved product mix impacts on gross margin. We are pleased to see the continued progress the team is making to drive margins within this segment.Within the Advanced Technology Systems segment, operating margin was 22% in the fourth quarter, which is an increase of approximately 150 basis points as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This margin enhancement is largely driven by lower spending in the quarter, as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter.Industrial Coating System segment improved operating margin by 425 basis points to 25%, which is a record for this segment. This margin enhancement is largely driven by better absorption and lower spending in the quarter as compared to the prior year's fourth quarter.On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was approximately $103 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.76. Excluding restructuring charges to step up in value of acquired inventory, and a net discrete tax expense in the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.79. EBITDA increased 15% over the prior year's fourth quarter to $164 million, or 28% of sales, and free cash flow before dividends increased 9% over the prior year's fourth quarter, or 125% of net income.I'll now share a few comments on full-year results. Sales for the fiscal year were $2.2 billion, a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year. This change in sales included a decrease in organic volume of 1%, growth related to the first-year effect of acquisitions of less than 1%, and a 2% decrease due to the unfavorable effect of currency translation, as compared to the prior year.Full year operating profit was $483 million. Reported operating margin was 22%, which is equal to last year's operating margin, despite lower sales. Net income for the full-year was $337 million, and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $5.79. Adjusted diluted earnings per share to exclude restructuring charges, the step up in value of acquired inventory and a net discrete tax expense was $5.87.EBITDA for the full-year was $587 million, or 27% of sales, equal to the prior year. Free cash flow before dividends was $320 million, or 95% of net income. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to EBITDA was approximately 1.9 times trailing 12 months EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter. In addition to funding organic and acquisitive growth initiatives with our free cash flow, we return value to our shareholders by distributing $82 million in dividends, and investing $115 million for the repurchase of shares during the year.A reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings per share is included within the financial exhibits of our press release. Our press release also includes financial exhibits reconciling net income, free cash flow before dividends, and adjusted free cash flow before dividends, as well as EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA.Moving on to fiscal 2020 guidance, forecasting organic sales volume growth in the range of 1% to 3%, as compared to fiscal year 2019, growth from the first-year effective acquisitions will add 20 basis points, and based on the current exchange rate environment, we expect an unfavorable currency translation effect of 30 basis points as compared to fiscal 2019. With the sales outlook, we expect to hold operating margin and EBITDA margin equal to fiscal 2019 results, offsetting the dilution of inflationary pressure on costs.We expect fiscal 2020 to be a typical year from a seasonality perspective, with a stronger second-half than the first, and with the first quarter being the softest quarter from the revenue perspective, and our margin performance will follow this pattern, given our direct model, where we have a relatively consistent level of spending from quarter-to-quarter. We expect interest expense to be approximately $36 million in fiscal 2020, and maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $50 million. Company's estimated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 is approximately 22%. Based on this outlook, GAAP diluted earnings per share growth is forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 6%, as compared to fiscal year 2019 GAAP diluted earnings per share. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Greg. Once again, I want to thank our team for delivering a solid full-year result against a challenging macro environment. As we look forward to fiscal 2020, we are taking a conservative approach to our outlook as we're not seeing indications that next year will be any better than the fiscal 2019 from a macroeconomic perspective. And though we are hopeful we'll see improved project activity in electronic end markets, convert into improved order trends, we are assuming a flat outlook for these product lines in fiscal 2020. The resilience of other end markets we serve, notably, consumer non-durables and medical, gives us confidence that even against a challenging macro environment, we will achieve total company organic sales growth in fiscal 2020.Before we move into Q&A, I want to recognize the important announcement that we made this morning. Greg Thaxton has announced his intention to retire in 2020. Greg started with Nordson in 1989 as a Financial Analyst. His sound judgment, strong financial acumen, and strategic leadership drove his success within the organization. Since 2008, he has served as Nordson's Chief Financial Officer. On behalf of the Nordson team, and our Board of Directors, I want to thank Greg for his many contributions to Nordson. Personally, I've appreciated Greg's leadership, perspective, and humor, as I've transitioned into the role of CEO. His passion for Nordson is evident to everyone who interacts with him.As a new CEO, one of the last things you want to hear is that your CFO is thinking about retiring. Greg was gracious to put his plans on hold so that Nordson could first execute a smooth CEO leadership transition. Now, it's his turn, and I wish you Greg and your family nothing but the best as you begin planning for this new chapter in your life, but before Greg gets too excited, he has committed to staying with us until his successor is identified and onboarded. Greg, would you like to say a few words? Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Naga. Earlier this year, I marked 30 years with Nordson. It has truly been a pleasure to be part of such a great organization, and I want to thank all those I have worked with over these many years. With Naga's direction, and the collaboration and support of our executive team, the company is planning for its next phase of profitable growth. This is an exciting time for Nordson, and I know the company is well-positioned, and I will remain committed to ensuring a smooth transition over the next several months. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Greg. We will be launching a search for Greg's successor, including both internal and external candidates. Thank you for your time and patience during this morning's call. We will now pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and Greg, congrats on a great long run at Nordson. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Chris. Christopher Glynn : A question on medical, I'm wondering if there is any like key program roll-offs you need to transition through on the horizon, or if you're expecting consistent performance with the long-term organic view there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Chris, thank you for your question. We don't see any roll-offs that significantly impact our performance. We had a real strong year in medical with 11% organic growth, and our expectations will continue to be consistent with our performance in medical. Christopher Glynn : Great. And then, just on the flat margin outlook for next year, understanding your conservative caveat, it does seem ADS built some structural momentum in the profitability in the second-half, and at ATS, the electronics is kind of scraping the bottom it seems, and you should have medical leverage. So, it seemed more intuitive that there is a bit of embedded margin tailwind there, if you could kind of comment on that the view? Sundaram Nagarajan : If you look at the midpoint of our sales forecast and include some currency offset and consider that we are a direct organization, we want to stay invested in our technology development and our sales interactions with our customers, we do expect inflationary impact on our labor costs, so there is really -- at the midpoint of our sales forecast there is probably not significant improvement to our margin, but as we move towards the higher end of our sales target, we would expect positive margin leverage. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. Thank you. I will pas it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks, and congrats, Greg. First, maybe can you just give a little more granularity into demand trends you saw in the fourth quarter and kind of what the outlook is for the different pieces of ADS being rigid, you know, polymer, non-wovens product assembly? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Matt. This is Greg. Order trends within adhesives, again, that's the kind of the resilient set of end markets with the non-durables have held up pretty well, pretty short, overall short cycle lead time. So, the performance that you saw in fourth quarter and really the full year is indicative of the resiliency of those end markets. We don't go down to that product line level, but we'd expect to continue to benefit from the strength of those end markets as well as where we bring innovation to new applications and new opportunities. So that's part of the business even against these challenging times, as we would expect it's held up pretty well. Matt Summerville : And then, maybe if you guys can just comment on what you're seeing in terms of actionability in the M&A pipeline, outside of medical, are there other areas and maybe test on the electronic side, outside of those two areas. Naga, are you looking to explore sort of other types of M&A avenues for the company going forward? Sundaram Nagarajan : These are fairly still early in sort of thinking about it. We still have significant opportunity in scaling up our medical platform and our testing inspection platform. So, we remain focused there. There are still opportunities. When they come to market is something we can't really determine, if we ever run out of opportunities there, you know, there are always other areas we're looking at, but in and out of the moment, so\u2026 Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning, and congrats Greg on the announcement today. You talked about ADS and some project, I guess, inquiries, could you talk relative to last year, are these increase picking up, I know it's tough to say if they'll move forward, but how was your feeling around this increase of projects for 2020? Sundaram Nagarajan : Allison, we certainly still see pretty good project activity. We're in middle of all of that. As you know, we're a market leader in those applications, where our customers lean on our technology and our capability to solve problems. So, we're in the middle of a lot of activity. We have not seen them convert into order rates or our order rates have not significantly picked up, but we're right in the middle of those projects. We feel very good about our market position, and continue to work with our customers. And as and when those project activities turn into orders, you will see us adjust our expectations. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then, just -- I guess your overall feeling, I mean, do you feel like we've reached some level of stability there where your downside risk is a little bit more minimal at this point? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, if you can sort of think about what we're seeing in our businesses today is, from third to fourth Quarter, we continue to see neutral, we really don't see any downside. Allison Poliniak : Great, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning, guys; Greg, congrats, good to hear. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Hey. Maybe just staying on electronics, where are you seeing specifically activity levels pick up that may not translate into orders? Sundaram Nagarajan : So, if you think about our electronic business, we are involved in a very diverse set of applications and end markets, including semiconductor packaging, product applications, to PC board, to automotive electronics, to 5G, so it's not one particular driver or the other, but overall throughout the electronics throughout the electronic supply chain, we are involved in multiple different applications, as you know, and we find that the project activities are pretty strong across the board. Jeff Hammond : Okay, maybe you can just comment on, I think you've talked at length about 5G and what you're seeing there, and then, just in terms of infrastructure and then what you're hearing from the mobile handset guys? Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : So, as I would tell you that, you know, 5G projects continue to be in project phase and conversation, and discussions, and product development phase. Really, as you think about 5G infrastructure rollout, they are slower than expected. Probably early days now, in terms of how these projects convert into orders, but in general, you will find that our activity levels are pretty good, and we're so engaged in solving issues for people. So, we feel good about our project activity, it just -- you know, they've not converted into orders yet, so\u2026 Greg Thaxton : And Jeff, it's Greg. I would add just from, what we tend to see from a seasonality perspective, this is kind of a low point at which we would tend to see project activity for some of those end markets that you were referring to. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, I know you won't give segment guidance, but would you expect each of the segments to be within that 1% to 3% organic, or I guess, Industrial Coating tends to be a little more economically sensitive, is there maybe a little more pressure there? Sundaram Nagarajan : As we look at 2020, we feel good that at the mid to high end of the -- you would expect to see organic growth across the segment. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, just housekeeping, I think you said $0.03 of kind of one-time items, can you spike that out on kind of a pre-tax basis, where would it hit the segments, or if there's -- I think you mentioned a tax item, or if anything hit corporate? Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. It really isn't significant across the segments. It's primarily some restructuring charges that hit across the segments, as well as corporate, and makes up the bulk of it. So it's not enough to really move margin performance for any particular business. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hi, good morning everyone, and congrats, Greg. So, first on the operational improvement side, it sounds like that's going well on the adhesives, maybe just some context on what you're seeing there and thoughts on what kind of actions you're thinking about into 2020? Sundaram Nagarajan : On the operational improvement side, on the Adhesive segment, pretty much as you indicated, all of those came from consolidations that happened last year. We're through most of those. We feel like we're in a pretty good place in terms of margin performance here. I would say, really the margin performance in that business is going to be more proportional to the volume rather than any structural restructuring that is still left in the business\u2026 Mike Halloran : Okay, that makes sense. And then the follow-up is when you're thinking about bridging GAAP to adjusted earnings for fiscal 2020, at this point, and is the thought that based on what you know today, the GAAP and the adjusted numbers are about equal in the next year, or is there something -- or is there any -- anticipated restructuring or other items that you think could? Greg Thaxton : No. Mike, this is Greg. It would be pretty much in line with the growth in reported EPS. Mike Halloran : So, you're saying GAAP, the expectations for GAAP EPS growth should be similar for adjusted EPS growth, adjusted 2020 versus adjusted 2019? Greg Thaxton : Correct. Mike Halloran : All right, great. I appreciate the time. Thank you. Greg Thaxton : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Seaport Global. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Greg. It's been a good run. I wanted to ask about the geographic regions, and there's -- it looks like the U.S. recovered a little bit, that's probably on the back of coatings. So, I wonder if we can just kind of review some of the geographic regions, and think about the EU, which looks like it weakens a little bit, as well as Japan and Asia Pac, which looks like they may be starting to recover, just any trends that you're seeing there. Greg Thaxton : Yes, Walt, this is Greg. I think you characterized some of it pretty well. U.S. volume really in the quarter, we saw good growth across each of the segments. Europe to a large extent is related to some softness. We've talked along throughout the year of some challenging comps within certain product lines within ICS [ph], primarily non-woven product line being up against really challenging comps from the last couple of years, and that's where many of the OEMs are located. So that's the largest impact there within Europe, and then in Asia Pacific, we're in the quarter, really some good strength across all the segments. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. The coatings part of the business, we had that slowdown last quarter, and then it looks like those shipments that got delayed came through. How did things look as you start the 2020 period, or are we back to kind of that macro overhang on coatings? Greg Thaxton : On the coatings, you're right, the fourth quarter, we suddenly realized the strong backlog that's going into the quarter. As we look into 2020, our expectations are it's going to be GDP kind of business. Really, we're through most of shipping all of our backlog there, but we're well-positioned to deliver on the GDP type of growth rate for ICS. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. And then, last one from me, just going back to the 5G, comments about infrastructure and mobile, for those of us who don't get the visibility that you do, why is the infrastructure part of that pushing out, and is there any region of the world where there's [indiscernible]? Greg Thaxton : So, think about the U.S. and the Europe, and just think about overall supply chain in the 5G has been disruptive pretty dramatically, because of -- trade disputes and such, and that is really a lot of project activities on a slower pace, and so, if you think about 5G technology as they transition into the phones, you really want to consider that the infrastructure work needs to get done first. Then if you back on the supply chain issues that have been created, that is really in our sort of understanding and recognition, that's sort of where there is some slowdown. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert from Longbow Research. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Hi, good morning everyone, and congratulations again, Greg. Did want a just quick talk on semis broadly and if you could just comment on what you're seeing at trends on tests and inspections specifically, that'd be really helpful. Sundaram Nagarajan : On the semi, yes, we do see increased activity, and certainly we on the test and inspection side, especially our X-ray businesses, given the complexity of the new semis that are starting to come out, [indiscernible] two-and-a-half. We are starting to see some new opportunities. We are in lots of new project activities right now still going on. So, our expectation as those project activities convert into orders that we would adjust our expectations for that thing. Greg Thaxton : And Chris, this is Greg. We've commented throughout the year that when you look at the electronic systems portion of advanced technology, it's really been the dispense platform that's been the area that we've seen the challenge against prior years. Test and inspection has held up pretty well for us this year, given all of these trends that are occurring within those spaces, and it's an area that we would expect to see some good growth opportunity going forward. Chris Dankert : Got it, got it. Thanks for the color there, guys. And circling back to Mike's question a little bit, obviously, we did lap the duplicative costs in Adhesive Dispensing and kind of that realignment, but my understanding was there was supposed to be some additional back-end synergies, as we kind of moved away from that, or is it as you said, I mean, we just need to get volumes to really see that benefit first? Greg Thaxton : Yes, this is Greg. We are through most of that, the consolidation that the period where we are incurring the duplicate costs, we were behind much of that at the end of last year and into this year. So, where we're going to see the benefit going forward would be as we're operating in a more efficient environment both from the standpoint of two facilities versus five, as well as where we've made investments in automation within the manufacturing environment, that's where we'll see the pick up, the efficiency gains in margin going forward. So, it's about pushing volume through this current state. Chris Dankert : Understood, that makes sense. And just one last one for me, on kind of what the M&A strategy is again, as you said medical kind of remains top of mind, test inspection, and I didn't hear -- as kind of the battery ceiling and pulled material dispensing that's still kind of on the menu as an additional M&A target? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. On the battery side, we have significant -- I would say organic growth opportunities in battery, and we've made some nice progress. We've made some nice wins in the marketplace, certainly some of which you're seeing in the ICS business, but we remain focused there, but it is not as big an opportunity when you compare it to test and inspection and our medical platforms. Greg Thaxton : Yes, we're participating in battery really in each of the three segments, and continuing to work with those who are driving the innovation there. So, it wouldn't be one that we would highlight as a target for M&A, it's more ensuring that we're funding the organic growth opportunities there within each of our segments. Chris Dankert : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Yes, I wanted to ask if the parts and consumables that perform pretty steady and in particular at ATS, as we're going through an extended period between equipment cycles for electronics, should [indiscernible] pick up in the products consumables, they're just wondering about that optionality? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Chris, this is Greg. On a full year basis -- and this would be kind of intuitive in a year where in some of the segments, our systems volume was down. On a full year parts, we are about 56% of revenue. Now, that's also aided by continued strong growth in medical, which is -- falls into that parts and consumables category. So, if we start to see a pick up in some of our end markets, and we're getting more system demand across the portfolio that might moderate a bit. On the other hand, we expect to continue to see medical growing at the kind of rates that we've been talking about historically. So, it's up a bit from historical, largely due to growth in the medical portion of the portfolio. Sundaram Nagarajan : And just it's also a math, right, because our systems as a percent of 70 was down. So, it certainly, you know, but we're pretty pleased with how we are growing that part of the business, and so, our expectation is that this will continue to be a big part of while we continue to grow the business. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Yes, I'm just wondering also if you see a particular driver that kind of necessitates for better growth into electronics products, as the equipment [indiscernible] install base. Sundaram Nagarajan : No, I would suggest that if we see an improvement in those end markets, it's going to be more about systems volume that's driving the top line. Christopher Glynn : Got it, thank you. Operator : We have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Again, I want to thank you for your support. Despite macro challenges for our business, the diversity of our end markets and our focus on customer solutions will allow us to grow and improve margins over the long-term. We appreciate your time and attention on today's call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to one of your speaker today, Lara Mahoney, please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Marcela. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, Nordson's President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, February 20th 2020 to report Nordson's fiscal year 2020 first quarter.Our conference call is being broadcast live on our Investor Relations webpage at investors.nordson.com, and it will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until March 5th, 2020, which can be accessed by dialing 416-621-4642. You will need to reference ID number 2468115.During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions.With that, I'll turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's 2020 fiscal first quarter conference call. 2020's first quarter performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter where sales were consistent with the typical seasonal pattern. As a reminder, our spending is generally consistent throughout the year due to our direct sales model and strong customer focus. So total company operating margin in the first quarter was also in line with our expectation. We expect sales to improve as we move through the year, allowing us to achieve our previously announced fiscal 2020 sales growth, margin and EPS guide.I'll speak more about our fiscal 2020 annual guidance in a few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed perspective on the quarter. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. First quarter sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year's first quarter. Change in sales included a decrease in organic sales of less than 1%, growth from the first year effect of acquisitions of less than 1%, decrease of approximately 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year's first quarter.First quarter's acquisitive growth includes the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Optical Control GmbH. Within the Adhesive Dispensing Systems segment, sales decreased 2% compared to the prior year's first quarter, inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of 1% and a decrease of 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year.Growth in our non-woven product line was offset by modest declines in other product lines segment in the Advanced Technology Systems segment. First quarter sales decreased approximately 1% compared to the prior year's first quarter, inclusive of a decrease in organic volume of 2%, increase of 1% related to the first year effect of the Optical Control acquisition, and decrease of less than 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Solid growth in medical product lines was offset by softness of those product lines supporting electronic end market.Industrial Coating Systems segment sales increased 9% compared to the prior year's first quarter, inclusive of organic volume growth of 9% and a decrease of less than 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Most product lines generated organic growth in the quarter, driven primarily by demand in the US associated with cold materials, outer systems product line.Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the total company was 53% in the quarter. Operating profit was $75 million with reported operating margin of 15%. During the quarter, we incurred approximately $3 million of restructuring charges as we realigned our cost structure within the Advanced Technology segment. Excluding this charge, total company operating margin was 16% and the Advanced Technology segment operating margin was 15%, down from last year's first quarter operating margin due to lower absorption and product mix impacts on gross margin.Operating margin performance for the Adhesive and Industrial Coating segments were both equal to the prior year's quarter. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $52 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.89, inclusive of a $0.04 per share charge related to restructuring and a $0.04 per share discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation.We delivered first quarter EBITDA of $101 million or 20% of sales. Excluding restructuring charges in the quarter, EBITDA margin was 21%. Free cash flow before dividends during the quarter was $102 million or 197% of net income. Free cash flow in the quarter benefited from collection of accounts receivable associated with the prior quarter revenue. Our press release includes financial exhibits reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and EBITDA, as well as the reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. From a balance sheet perspective, net debt to EBITDA was approximately 1.7 times trailing 12 months EBITDA at the end of the first quarter.I'll now turn the call over to Naga for a few closing comments. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Greg. We remain committed to our annual organic sales growth guidance of 1% to 3% for fiscal 2020 with this growth being generated in the second half of the fiscal year. The incremental revenue will generate improved operating and EBITDA margins as we move through the year where we expect to deliver a total year margin performance equal to fiscal 2019 and EPS growth in the range of 2% to 6% over FY '19. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment, including the impact of coronavirus in the Asia-Pacific region. Our facilities in China are operational and we expect to be closer to full capacity soon.I want to thank our employees in China for incredibly committed to serving the needs of our customers, along with the rest of the Nordson team, who supported our China employees during the difficult time in many ways. We greatly appreciate all of their efforts, and we'll continue to do all we can to support our employees and their families. Although there may be some impact on sales in our second fiscal quarter as we scale up production, our supply chain recovers, our customers resume operations and delivery schedules return to normal, we do not expect a material impact from coronavirus on our full year results.Before we open the phone lines for Q&A, I want to share a few observations from my first six months at Nordson. This is a great company that's driven by talented employees who are focused on serving their customers. While we are focused on delivering our near-term 2020 results, we are aligning our internal priorities on the greatest long-term opportunity for this business' profitable growth.To deliver profitable growth, we have four key priorities. First and foremost, we need to sustain the historical organic growth track record. We'll do this through our focus on innovation, emerging markets and new applications. Second, we need to diversify our business portfolio, including through acquisitions. We'll stay true to what makes us great, which is precision technology. This includes scaling our Medical and Test and Inspection product line. Number three, we need to implement a growth-focused strategic framework that allows us to grow sustainably. I'm pleased that Nordson has a good start on this with the Nordson Business System. With the executive leadership team, we are evaluating how we can take NBS to the next level. I believe there is an opportunity for Nordson in refining and executing on this growth framework. Our fourth priority is folks -- focused on developing a deep and diverse team to support our growth aspirations. I'm pleased with the customer focus team that we have today. As we grow, we will need more of them.I'm also pleased to announce our plans for an Investor Day in the fall, where we will discuss our long-term plans for the business in more detail. Please mark your calendar for the morning of September 30th, 2020, the event will be focused at the New York Plaza -- Palace Hotel and available through webcast. More information will be available in the coming months. As always, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for their continued support.With that, we'll pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D,A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Good morning. First of all, can you maybe talk about within the Adhesive business what the organic volume outlook looks like for the balance of the year as the compares in that business get a bit tougher beyond what was an easier comparison in Q1 and in the quarter where organic volume actually declined against that somewhat easy comparison? Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Matt. We don't provide guidance by segment for organic growth rate. We fully stay committed to our full-year total company guidance of 1% to 3%. Matt Summerville : Okay. And then, with respect to maybe the coronavirus, did you see any discernible impact late in your fiscal first quarter, and is there a way to sort of frame up what you think that impact could look like in Q2 and maybe talk about how we should be thinking about the sequential earnings cadence for the company, perhaps if seasonality is pushed a bit to the right here relative to a more normal year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Matt, I think there were two sort of questions in there, I assume, right. So, the first one is around coronavirus. The impact of awareness in our first quarter was immaterial as we had already planned for the Lunar New Year and had shipments already scheduled and went out in time. We don't expect to have a material impact from coronavirus on our full year results. As we look at it today, we don't see any impact in the second quarter. If there is further disruption in the supply chain or customers having trouble getting back to capacity, there maybe some delay in orders that may get pushed out following quarter. So that is on coronavirus. And I think you had a question around earnings cadence for the company. Matt Summerville : Yeah. Sundaram Nagarajan : Is that correct? Matt Summerville : Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : So, our growth is -- based on our typical seasonality, most of our growth always happens in the second quarter -- in the second half, I should say, I'm sorry. So, as we go into second half, this increased revenue will improve and will generate improved operating margins and EBITDA margins that typically have very strong flow through as we have higher sale. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey. Good morning, guys. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in electronics as you go into the heavier kind of quoting and order season around 5G infrastructure, 5G mobile and just kind of project inactivity levels going into the year. I know that's something we've been looking for an inflection. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. As you know, there is a lot of press regarding 5G infrastructure, and we continue to believe that that is where we will see the greatest opportunity. The progress also on infrastructure build out has been slow and slowing. As mentioned before, we don't expect growth in our electronic business compared to fiscal '19 in 2020, that's not what we have forecasted, but our project activities continue to be robust. We are in great conversations. When that wave of 5G infrastructure hits, we will benefit from it. So, as of now, project activities are strong. We continue to be participating in a lot of quoting, timing is what it will be dependent on when those project activities convert into order. And you're right, we are at that point in terms of typical order rates will pick up to have us confidence in delivering that second -- strong second half, and that's what gives us the strength in maintaining our guidance for the full year of 1% to 3%. Lara Mahoney : And just to add to that, 5G is an important element, of course. It's indicative of change, but we also -- automotive electronics, AI, there are a lot of different applications, which -- where we are diversified. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then, it looks like the US business was particularly strong in the quarter. What do you see that's working there well? Sundaram Nagarajan : It is primarily related to our ICS business that has done well. And certainly our Adhesive businesses in US have also continuing to do well. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then, just on the second half, so I guess you mentioned some of the project visibility. But other than kind of just typical seasonality, is there anything else in the quoting or activity pipeline that gives you that confidence in kind of an acceleration as you move through the year? Sundaram Nagarajan : No, it is our typical season seasonality. And we certainly expect -- based on our project activity and our seasonal pattern, we feel pretty strongly about a strong second half, and which we have seen in the past too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Just had a question about the SG&A was beta $9 million sequentially adjusted or unadjusted. And the last five years, typically that spend has been down $5 million or $8 million 4Q to 1Q, so wondering if that indicate some strategic imperative that your kind of front log or pipeline is mandating. Greg Thaxton : Chris, this is Greg. I wouldn't suggest it's much of what you just talk to there. I would say that the first quarter did have a $2 million one-time cost in the corporate managed -- in the corporate expense line. So that's a non-recurring item. That corporate expense line item, if you were modeling that out, I would expect that to be more around $12.5 million per quarter than in the current quarter. If you back that out, then I think you're looking at a pretty modest increase current year over the prior year. And in the first quarter is a year when -- is the quarter when we have our global compensation increases. So as compared to the fourth quarter, you get a little bit of bump associated with our merit increases hitting in Q1. So if you look at current quarter versus prior year first quarter, it's a pretty modest increase when you exclude that $2 million one-time item. Christopher Glynn : Okay. So that sort of suggest spending was a bit restrained after the first quarter last year, because I'm looking at -- if you carry the first quarter SG&A spend rates for the year and you get 2% top line growth and SG&A to sales would be up about 100 basis points. So, you're suggesting that's a wrong way to look at it? Greg Thaxton : Well, what I am -- what I would suggest, Chris is, it is dependent upon that top line growth. If you assume that in our spending over prior year, we're going to have inflationary impact, we're going to have our merit increase, it's the need to generate that top line growth to offset what that dilution might deliver from spending. Christopher Glynn : Is 1Q the high watermark for SG&A spend on a run rate basis? Greg Thaxton : Yeah. Given the sales that -- from a seasonal perspective, it's our lowest quarter. That's true. Christopher Glynn : So as you had sort of spend will be higher in subsequent quarters? Greg Thaxton : Our spending is fairly flat as you move throughout the year, as Naga mentioned in his comments. With our global infrastructure, we don't flex that based upon seasonality of sales trends. So it's a pretty fixed number as you move through the year. So, in terms of the margin impact, it's more heavily dependent upon the top line sales number. Lara Mahoney : So first quarter spending was a higher mark for the year. Christopher Glynn : Sorry, Lara. Can you clarify that? I didn't hear. Lara Mahoney : I'm just agreeing with you that it is a higher watermark as a percentage of sales to your earlier question, just based on that spend. Christopher Glynn : Okay. I'll follow up offline. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. I just want to go back to your comment, Naga, on just kind of looking at that growth rate mark and sort of maintaining a sustainable growth that Nordson's experienced. Any high level color there of how we should think about that comment? Is it end market? Is it different, I guess, new products, any color there? Sundaram Nagarajan : I think the strategic growth framework is really, and I will spend a lot of time here, we are building that out as we are enhancing our existing NBS framework. It would be really -- a couple of things that I would add there. That strategic framework is going to be focused on really selecting the best growth opportunities for the company, so really bringing -- bringing forth a strategic view of where we invest and what kind of end market product niches do we want to grow win. So that would be one of the distinguishing factor that will add to the existing growth framework. And the growth framework also consists of things that the company does really, really well, which is commercial excellence, product innovation. So this new great growth framework is really an enhanced version of our existing NBS next. And it adds strategic view of what are the best product market combinations that we want to focus on. So think of that as a greater strategic discipline around where we want to grow, in combination with things that the company is really, really good at, which is commercial excellence, close to the customer model, as well as innovation leading to precision technologies that solves the best problems for our customers. Allison Poliniak : Great. And thanks for the color on that. And then, on -- thanks for the coronavirus color. It's good to hear things are getting sort of up and running again. Have you -- I mean, are you experiencing any elevated costs as we sort of get back up and running in terms of getting components then or getting projects out as a result of what's going on? Sundaram Nagarajan : At the present moment, no. Our hope is that the supply changes are continuing to improve as we are seeing. And if this continues over a longer period of time, then there may be some delivery that could get pushed out. But no, on the cost side, we are fairly -- we have good visibility and fairly comfortable. We have very good inventories that will allow us to continue on the path we're on. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Mark Halloran : So, quick question just on the acquisition and M&A side of things. What does the pipeline look like and some of the management changes that now you're a little newer to the scene. And then, with Greg's upcoming departure, does it change your willingness to go after things as it sits here today? Sundaram Nagarajan : No. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. And our priorities there continue to be funding our organic growth, maintaining our dividend streak, acquiring in the spaces that we have expressed an interest in and focused on, which is Medical and Test and Inspection. In terms of acquisition pipeline, we have good opportunities. We continue to work them. When they come to market is something we don't control, but look for us to continue to stay disciplined and focused on what makes the company strong, which is precision technology and two areas as I mentioned earlier that we will remain focused on is Medical and Test and Inspection. Mark Halloran : And then, anything in the Industrial Coating side that you'd point to for the strength? It seems mostly comparisons were a little easier and sequential seemed about normal, but anything in there that was unusual or just pretty normal cadence? Sundaram Nagarajan : It is pretty normal. As you mentioned, the comps were a little easier. There were some project timing, certainly things that we worked on in the fourth quarter certainly helped us in the first quarter, but nothing significant. Operator : There are no further questions at this time, I will turn the call back over to your presenters. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you again for joining us today, and we'll talk to you soon.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to one of your speakers today, Lara Mahoney. Thank you. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, Casey. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Greg Thaxton, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, May 21, 2020, to report Nordson's fiscal year 2020 second quarter results.Our conference call is being broadcast live on our web page at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until June 4, 2020, which can be accessed by dialing (416) 621-4642. You will need to reference ID number 8187700.During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions.With that, I'll turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2020 second quarter conference call. It's incredible how much the world has changed in the few months since our February conference call. We hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. In the second quarter, our team was focused on two critical priorities, detecting the health and safety of our employees and responding to the needs of our customers. I'm so thankful to our colleagues around the world for their flexibility, resilience, and commitment as we have navigated through this pandemic. I'm proud of the Nordson team.One of Nordson\u2019s greatest strengths is the diversity of end markets, which is certainly contributing to our results to this point in the year. And during this period, all of our production facilities have continued to manufacture products for critical infrastructure applications. Going forward, our focus will continue to be on maintaining health and safety of our employees as we transitioned from working remotely where social distancing, regular cleaning, temperature checks, face coverings and other protocols will be essential.Representatives from our global teams have been coming together to share best practices and lessons learned. We're all moving forward together in a conservative manner to ensure everyone's safety. While we remain focused on actively managing this dynamic environment, I'm equally committed to moving this organization forward and making progress toward our strategic objectives. The greatest opportunity for Nordson is profitable growth.On March 30, we announced a business realignment that will make us more agile in accomplishing our strategic priorities of accelerating organic growth, diversifying through acquisition, leveraging the Nordson Business System and focusing on talent development. Today we will discuss our results in terms of our two new segments : Industrial Precision Solutions and Advanced Technology Solutions.I'll speak more about the business in few moments, but first I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed perspective on the second quarter. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Naga and good morning to everyone. Second quarter 2020 sales decreased 4% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. This change included a decrease of approximately 3% in organic volume and a decrease of approximately 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Growth in the quarter related to the first year effect of the fiscal 2019 acquisition of Optical Controls was not significant.Within the Industrial Precision Solutions segment, which combines our previous Adhesive Dispensing Systems and Industrial Coating Systems segments, sales decreased approximately 6% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. This change included a decrease in organic sales volume of approximately 4% and a decrease of 2% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year. Relatively strong sales performance of those product lines serving consumer non-durable end markets such as packaging and nonwovens is offset by weakness in sales of product lines serving end markets such as automotive and general industrial.Sales in the Advanced Technology Solutions segment decreased approximately 1% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter. This change included a decrease in organic sales volume of less than 1%, an increase of less than 1% related to the first year effective acquisitions and a decrease of less than 1% related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation as compared to the prior year.Sales volume increased in product lines serving medical end markets and fluid dispense product lines serving electronics end markets. This growth was offset by weakness in our test and inspection product lines and fluid dispense product lines serving industrial end markets.Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the total company was 55% in the quarter. Operating profit was $125 million with reported operating margin of 24%, up 20 basis points over the prior year\u2019s second quarter. I\u2019ll comment on the segment operating margins specifically, however, in addition to reducing our compensation accruals, this quarter\u2019s operating margin reflects our focus on spending control to offset the decline in sales.This includes our efforts to not only reduce discretionary spending but also defer open headcount additions within the organization. We would expect to continue with a conservative bias towards spending during the second half of the year as we monitor order trends, where our selling and administrative expenses in the second half of fiscal 2020 are estimated to be in line with our prior year\u2019s second half spending.On a segment basis, the Industrial Precision Solutions segment operating margin was 27% in the quarter. This compares to 28% in the prior year\u2019s second quarter. As compared to the prior year, the current year\u2019s second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted by lower sales volume. Within the Advanced Technology Solutions, reported operating margin was 24% in the second quarter as compared to 23% in the prior year second quarter. This improvement in operating margin was primarily driven by product mix. On a total company basis, net income for the quarter was $92 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.58.We delivered second quarter EBITDA of $152 million or 29% of sales, up 30 basis points over last year second quarter. Free cash flow before dividends during the quarter was $90 million, resulting in cash conversion of 98% of net income. Year-to-date cash conversion is 134% of net income, which was positively impacted by the collection of receivables in the first quarter from the strong finish to fiscal year 2019. Our press release includes financial exhibits, reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends and adjusted free cash flow before dividends as well as EBITDA.From a balance sheet perspective, we had a cash balance of $306 million at the end of the second quarter, as we took a conservative position to ensure appropriate liquidity. In addition to this cash position, we have our undrawn $850 million revolving credit facility available. Net debt to EBITDA was approximately 1.7 times trailing 12 months EBITDA at the end of the second quarter. Company returned value to shareholders by investing $38 million to repurchase approximately 300,000 shares during the quarter, which is intended to offset this year's benefit plan dilution, and we paid $22 million in dividends during the quarter.In summary, our top line has held up considering the challenging macro environment, where we benefit from the diversity of the end markets we serve. Nordson team has responded in a great way in supporting our customers and delivered solid performance in the quarter. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to allow us to stay focused on longer term strategic initiatives.I'll now turn the call back to you, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Greg. Again, I want to thank our colleagues around the world for their incredible commitment to our customers during this quarter. This is an uncertain time for many and the Nordson team\u2019s strong execution is commendable. Our performance through the first half of the year has been solid considering the impact of COVID-19. That said, this is an incredibly dynamic environment and it is difficult to accurately predict the impact this pandemic will have on our business for the remainder of the year.Our backlog at the end of the second fiscal quarter has increased approximately 6% compared to the same period a year ago, which is certainly a positive sign. The backlog is split evenly between the IPS and ATS segments. On the other hand, order rates have begun to soften in the last several weeks. We measure order rates in constant currency with pro forma growth in order rates calculated as though the fiscal year 2019 acquisition was owned in both years. For the 12 week period ending May 10th, 2020, order rates decreased 4% for the same period a year ago.IPS segment order rates decreased 12%, while ATS segment order rates increased 6% both as compared to the same period a year ago. Looking at a shorter period of time, over the last six weeks, the total company order rates are down 11% compared to the prior year with IPS down 14% and ATS down 7%. Though six weeks may not be a trend to forecast performance for the balance of the year, these results do highlight the volatility we are dealing with at this time. Because of these uncertainties and the lack of clarity about the duration and impact of the pandemic, we are suspending our previously announced annual guidance for fiscal 2020. We\u2019ve also decided to postpone our fall 2020 Investor Day, which I referenced in the first quarter conference call.While the near-term demand trends are unclear, I am excited about the future of Nordson. We have a solid foundation fortified by the diversity of our business, our strong customer centric business model and market leading position technologies. Our liquidity and past financial performance are good indicators of Nordson strength and resilience and the diversity of end markets we serve. We will stay invested in what makes notes in strong, innovation and our talented global organization. Our connectivity to our customers is critical, particularly in an environment like this. We will however, continue to monitor this dynamic environment to ensure we are taking appropriate action to manage the business through these uncertain times.Before we open the call for Q&A, I want to highlight a recent CFO announcement. On May 8th we announced that Joseph Kelley will be joining Nordson as new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective July 6th, 2020. Joe brings over 25 years of financial and operational expertise to the role. During the search process, Joe's experience as a public company CFO, as well as his operational finance experience met him the right candidate to help us execute our long-term vision for Nordson.I'm excited to welcome Joe to the strong Nordson leadership team that is focused on driving sustainable, profitable growth in the coming decade. Greg will be staying with the company through August to ensure Joe has a smooth transition. On behalf of Nordson, I want to thank Greg for his time, energy, especially as we have navigated this current environment. Greg, your support and flexibility is greatly appreciated. As always, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support.With that, we'll pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Michael Halloran : Good morning everyone and congrats Greg on a really great run. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike. Michael Halloran : So first question, thanks a lot for the context on the order side. Could you just dig a layer lower and talk about whether you're seeing any variance in the end market trends relative to what you would have talked about for the fiscal second quarter, so the non-durables and medical pieces of electronics doing well and industrial softening a little bit? And also may be put in context where you're seeing some benefits from what's happening from an environment perspective in the comments as well. Please. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Thank you, Mike for the question. Let's get started with overall the diversity of end markets that Nordson serves, certainly came through strong and benefited us in the quarter and certainly contributed to our results through the first half. As we think about the order trends, as we have talked about this, overall what we see for the total company for the 12 week period, not since total order rates are down 4%. And in the six week period, it is down 11%. And if you go further down, if you look at the IPS segment, there is really not a whole lot of disconnect between the first \u2013 between the 12 weeks and the six week order rates.And mainly what you see in IPS, if you think about the product lines in IPS, we see strength in non-durables, especially a lot of strength in nonwoven applications in making mass COVID testing kits, liquid and container product lines, so with really good strength on the non-woven applications and some product categories that you would expect in the consumer non-durable end market. But that is offset by some significant declines in large system kind of businesses like our ICS with bordered systems, as well as PPS that serves the automotive end market. So where do you have systems and when it serves industrial or automotive end markets, we do see the declines.But in general for IPS between the six week and 12 week, really not a lot of difference. When you think about our ATS segment, coming into the quarter, the first \u2013 the 12 week trends were up 9%. But if you look at a shorter period of time, really if we're down 12% and this is really, if you think about it, this weakness we have seen mainly in our electronic systems dispense side. So if you think about that a little bit more, our dispense system product categories are typically higher price and they also come in larger volumes. So what we are not able to sort of ascertain is that, is this six week weakness from trend or is it just indicative of the typical volatility we would see.So to remind you that the company is really \u2013 we use the 12 week order trend because of these CapEx cycles, we tend to use the 12 week as a better indicator. But given the environment and given the weakness we're seeing in the shorter-term, I\u2019d point you to where we've seen is really in the electronic systems. And to give you some color around, where are we seeing this trends. Mike, what we are really this trends, we\u2019ve talked about the nonwovens in the IPS segment; in the ATS, really our medical product lines are doing really well, we see a pretty nice trends there. It is really all around the pulmonary and cardiac bypass machine applications, we have number of connectors and things that we use in ventilators and other applications and in testing kits as well.So we see good strength in medical applications, we have some really good applications around semiconductor for electronics dispense businesses. PC board in general is also really up, where we see weaknesses in ATS is really dispense applications for industrial end market. Michael Halloran : That makes a lot of sense. Go ahead, Greg. Greg Thaxton : Yes, just to lay over that, that's great color on the end market. So again, the change from the 12 to six not much in IPS and just to clarify on the ATS that was a plus six through 12 weeks and a negative seven in the six weeks and Naga did a good job of highlighting what was really the change from the 12 to six was around the systems side of electronic systems. Michael Halloran : I appreciate that and really great color. So on the capital strategy here is strong balance sheet, liquidity is in a very good position, strong free cash flow. So how are you thinking about balancing the near-term potential challenges in the unknowns versus turning more offensive and investing in the long-term? I'm guessing on the internal investment sides and the growth initiatives, probably not a lot of change there, but maybe touch on that briefly and then also touch on how you're thinking about the M&A side, keeping powder dry for that as well as share buybacks. Sundaram Nagarajan : So let me talk about our capital allocation priorities. Really, they remain consistent, no changes there. Our number one priority is continuing to fund our internal organic growth initiatives. Just remember that Nordson is a asset-light business model, hence, we spend about 2% to 3% of our revenue on CapEx is for internal projects, we continue to plan to do that in terms of we have a good dividend policy that \u2013 we continue to increase dividend in line with our earnings, we'll continue to do that. And if you think about our share repurchases, our share repurchases are mainly our baseline strategy is to offset dilution from our compensation plans. And we intend to do that as we have seen dislocation in the marketplace, we have acted to sort of implement that strategy and that's what you saw in the last quarter.And finally, when you think about acquisitions, acquisition is an important key growth lever for the company. We want to use acquisitions to allow us to continue to diversify the portfolio we're in, but we're going to be disciplined. We want to acquire things that makes Nordson really strong and special. That is really all about acquiring assets and properties that allow us to create precision technologies that create value for our customers. So we're going to stay disciplined to that, we've clearly identified where we want to focus on acquisitions, which is really medical and test and inspection and maybe if there are bolt-on opportunities in our strong core businesses where we add a lot of value, we will certainly act.But given the environment, we are going to continue to stay focused on the long-term, continue to act on opportunities, but keeping the environment in mind. So that's sort of where we are and I could add more color if you are little bit more interested in other areas. Michael Halloran : No, that was very helpful. Appreciate as always. And stay safe everyone. Thank you. Greg Thaxton : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you and good morning. Following up on the question on the order trends, you talked about the slowing order growth over the last six weeks. Could you just provide some color on the cadence of orders and did you see any improvement through the last six weeks. So maybe the ending week was a little bit better than the average? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. So in general, if you think about our order trend. Week to week, it is very difficult to sort of say that we could have a trend and given the CapEx nature of our businesses, you're going to find week to week changes. Broadly speaking, I would say the trends really are the two that highlighted, which is really on our IPS, really no difference. In that it is down about that 10% to \u2013 12% to 14%, that's really \u2013 that seems to have between 12 weeks and six weeks really no change.But in our ATS, we went from plus 6 to negative 7 and that weakness we really saw in our electronic system business, and there, as we highlighted, what you would see is just the lumpiness of electronic system orders coming in and you know, it would be really difficult area for us to give you an indication of the volatility from week-to-week, because we can get a large order in a single week, and really no order in the following week. So it is really important for us to look at it over a time period, and that's why the company has always used the 12 week as a good marker of how things are moving forward. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks. Appreciate that. Yes, thank you. So I appreciate the color on the weakness in auto and general industries within IPS, could you just help quantify the declines you saw in these markets and how are you thinking about the outlook for the remainder of the year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me \u2013 Saree, let me have Greg, would you add some color to the... Greg Thaxton : Yes, Saree, we typically don't \u2013 go down to that level of quantification just for both customer, as well as competitive dynamics. But we've got several product lines in the portfolio, from an injection molding perspective as well as from some structural dispense applications that we sell into. It's not a, it's not a large portion of the overall portfolio. We gave some color on that in our investor deck, but it's just one set of end markets that we put into that industrial bucket, where we saw some softness in the quarter. It's around 5%, 6% of the company's total business. Saree Boroditsky : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Couple of questions. First, getting back to kind of the order trends you've seen over the last 12 to six weeks. I was wondering if you could add some geographic depths to that, perhaps talking about what you're seeing here in North America versus Europe versus Asia including China, please? Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me give you a broad color and then probably have Greg take you through some details. In general what we're seeing is that, Asia is starting to recover and if you think about Europe, it's still in a state of flux and U.S. is probably steadying it out. So let me turn it over to Greg, so that he can provide you some more detail on the specific order trends. Greg Thaxton : Yes, Matt, and I'll pick up Naga's color that he provided, where we see generally, the consumer non-durables, the medicals, those kind of things and each one of the geographies have held up well, where we talk about the biggest change from the 12 to the six week being in the electronic systems portion of the portfolio, most of that, we've got a lot of those customers that are in Asia and a fair amount in Europe. So where we saw the softness in the 12 versus six in that electronic systems was primarily in those two geographies. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then... Greg Thaxton : Specific to those end markets. Generally when we think about the consumer non-durable, the medical those kind of \u2013 it has been pretty consistent in the 12 week and six week. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you for that color. And then just as a follow-up. Is there anything, any sort of conclusion to be drawn with respect to what you're seeing in electronics order rates now and what that might foretell, looking forward with respect to 5G related projects for both devices and infrastructure? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. So let's maybe broadly talk about our electronic system business. So if you remember, in our electronic system business, we have our dispense part of it and we have our test and inspection, and both of these are larger dollar value systems when compared to, say our packaging system. So if you compare those two, so you're going to see some amount of lumpiness that are associated with this set of product categories.And so for us as we sit here today, if we did not have this macro environment, we wouldn't be talking about this near-term disconnect between the 12 week, because we would say that is normal volatility. But given the backdrop, we thought it would be important to provide you a little additional color. It is very difficult for us to see it today, that is either the normal volatility or is it the lumpiness of our order rates, which we normally see.Around 5G, let me talk to you a little bit about what we are seeing today and where we are and what the opportunity looks like. 5G in general is a growth driver for us. It is going to be an important growth driver, not only just in the mobile set, but it's also going to be in the base infrastructure for our 5G. We're going to have opportunities in IoT devices. We're going to have opportunities in auto electronics. We're going to have opportunities in consumer electronics. So it's going to be a pretty broad based opportunity for the company.The rollout of 5G is certainly slower than we had all hoped and would like. For a number of different reasons, still a technology that is getting sorted out, there are some issues around supply chains. We participate in 5G across a number of things. We start with a semiconductor, as we've talked to you about on our electronics side. We are really highly diversified across the entire supply chain. So we start with the semiconductors, where somebody is making a chip for 5G application, we certainly work with component manufacturers, who then integrate these into filters or switches or antennas.We certainly participate there. Then you have PCB board manufacturer, who assemble those components on a board, and then you have the end product application. So we participate in all of these, for 5G where we're seeing most of the activity, is mostly on Semiconductors. We're seeing some activity in PC board. We're also seeing some activity in the components. But overall, we are well positioned, but it will be a matter of timing and due to this environment, it's really difficult for us to say that this would be \u2013 long-term, it\u2019s an important driver for us. Matt Summerville : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. And firstly, best wishes. Greg, thanks for all your help over the years with understanding Nordson. Good luck with everything. Next, I want point to is supply chain, as you start to ramp or just even in production, Nordson is fully producing. But any supply chain challenges that you guys are noticing or kind of have to deal with in today's environment? Any color there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Allison, in terms of supply chain, really nothing material. We have a very robust risk mitigation and a risk analysis program with our supply chain. The teams have done a wonderful job of really executing against risk mitigation. We had maybe occasional one or two issues, which were handled fairly in a quick and expedient manner. What we have in terms of supply chain have faced is that, there were some constraints around freight, and we've had to pay a little bit more on freight. But that was just a near-term issue. In general, we don't have the supply chain issues. China is up and running. So I believe we are in a fairly, fairly strong position that way. Allison Poliniak : Great. And then you touched on it a little bit, incremental costs that you're having to deal with, in terms of managing through this environment, both internally with Nordson and you just mentioned, freight. Is there anyway to help quantify that? Is it significant or is it I would say minimal at this point? Any thoughts there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Allison, it\u2019s pretty minimal at this point really. But it is a constraint that we saw early in the process, not anymore, but immaterial. Greg, do you have any additional color? Greg Thaxton : That's right. It's not a material amount, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Okay. And then within the quarter, was there any of your facility shutdown? Just trying to get some thought around \u2013 context around that? Sundaram Nagarajan : Not really all of our facilities are really deemed, supporting critical infrastructure and so we were working through all of this. There were one or two product lines we may not have made for a short period of time, but very limited, really no impact on our facilities. Allison Poliniak : Great, thanks so much. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Alison. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead, your line is now open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : And Greg, best of luck in your retirement and congrats on the new hire. Just on the \u2013 can you just go to the mobile handset space, I think you had kind of two years off in terms of spending cycle, and I think this year was anticipated to be a better cycle, and I know there's been a little bit of delays, but just what are you hearing from the mobile handset OEMs, in terms of their level of investment kind of after two years off? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, you know to probably put it in context, right. So if you think about, when we started the past, for the company, mobile phone volumes went from $30 million to $1.5 billion, right. So a significant run over a decade, which certainly the company fully participated in and was an incredibly strong growth driver. But as you think about mobile volume growth, as you would read and have seen, there is really not going to be significant volume. What you are going to continue to see is new technology that our \u2013 new innovation, new features that are going to continue to come into the phone. And every time that happens, as you know, every change every innovation, Nordson clearly benefits from this, right?And so from that perspective, we feel good about the projects we are working with our customers, in terms of \u2013 every time there is an innovation, we participate in it because Nordson is really an innovation go-to partner, we are part of people's technology roadmaps. So what we're really seeing is, feature adds in new technologies that we are participating in. And most of those features are still on track. Where we do see some uptick is really in variables, and those are new applications for the company, and we are really participating in those. Those are sort of mobile related, but not quite mobile themselves. So I think that's a new area that we have been enjoying and we see some nice growth there. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then certainly the decremental is good. I think some of the \u2013 in this quarter, some of that, I think you attributed the product mix in Advanced Tech. Just kind of looking at the order cadence in ATS, how would you think \u2013 how should we think about product mix into the second half, impacting margins for Advanced Tech? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Greg, do you want to take some of the detail on that? Greg Thaxton : Yes, Jeff, I think the way I would think about that is, as we've characterized to this point, medical has been very strong. So we would expect to continue that momentum in medical. I think that the question is really around the volatility if you will, that we've seen in the order rates when you look at that 12 week versus six week in more of the systems side of the business. And again, it's not that that six week makes a forecastable trend. But it does create in our mind, what is this backdrop doing to our customers in terms of their willingness to move forward with their projects.We're certainly working a lot of projects. We're involved in a lot of projects. The uncertainty is, how many of those will come to market this year. We feel very well positioned with project activity. It's what will hit this year. So you've got one aspect of the business that's been very strong, continues to be very strong. Where we have product lines that sell dispense into the industrial. They've been challenged pretty much through this first six months. The question mark really is on the electronic systems side of the business, what of those projects are going to go forward through the year. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then final one on medical, I mean, it sounds like there are certain product lines or end markets that are seeing unique strengths. And one, just want to understand that what you're seeing in terms of visibility and sustainability there or is it a short-term pop? And then conversely, there's been a lot of elective surgeries delayed. Did you see any kind of negative impact from that and would you expect any snapback as elective surgeries kick in? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. So let's talk about elective surgeries first. For the kind of products and core components that we supply, we have minimal exposure to elective surgery. And so really did not see a whole lot of impact from it. There were some but very limited, right. And broadly thinking about our medical portfolio of products, really there are two sort of areas that we participate in.One is sort of core components, very critical devices, value-added devices \u2013 value-added components that help our med device customers safely and effectively deliver therapies. So that is the part of the business where you have either a pulmonary or a cardiac-related therapies, we are fully participating in, we see very good activities that continues to be pretty strong for us. We do fairly well there. We see a lot of new innovation work there. We continue to participate and that's doing well.The second half of the business really is around, really critical connectors and things that are used for lots of other things such as, a good example would be a ventilator application or an IV application. So in number of areas, we see a significant pickup and we continue to \u2013 expect to continue to grow there. But remember there is a baseline market growth that still is intact for us. We have very limited exposure to elective surgery. This business has done well, order trends in this business is pretty strong as well. Jeff Hammond : Okay, excellent. Thanks guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Glynn : I wanted to \u2013 hey, good morning and Greg, good to hear you for the encore. Very curious on the packaging side, really both rigid and flexible with hoarding and everything going on and a lot of your customer's products in the packaging there. I'm just wondering if you're seeing a particularly constructive backdrop to create a recapitalization dynamic. If you see any differentiated points from rigid versus flexible, could that be a lagged effect of the COVID dynamic, where the benefit actually kicks in a little further than some of the immediate impacts from pockets of medical demand by contrast? Sundaram Nagarajan : The packaging really serving the non-durable part of the company has really held up nicely for us. This is an area that we have as you know, a very strong market position and strong market leader that provides leading technology. So I would say, both parts and systems fairly well held up during this period of time. In terms of flexible versus rigid packaging, for us really, we participated in both. We don't really see a significant uptake one way or the other.But our polymer based businesses, which sort of helps the flexible side, has been helped. But you also have the overhang of automotive injection molding applications that kind of overweighs that. So our traditional adhesive packaging businesses look really well. We continue to invest in technology here. We continue to be really focused around making sure our customers are really having good productivity and certainly working on cost savings.So as you can think about it, right, in terms of your \u2013 recap of our capital positions, our businesses and our systems are such, their value is very small when compared to the savings we can bring to a customer when they improve efficiency or productivity or material savings. So really \u2013 we really liked the position we have. We think we will benefit from it. For now, it is holding up nicely. Would that be a tailwind, there potentially could be. Greg Thaxton : And Chris, this is Greg. I would add that. Generally, if we see like we do across the businesses, if there's a change in packaging. So for example, when there has been shift toward smaller single-serve type of packaging, that's a good thing for us because that often means a recap of those lines. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks for that. And then on the electronic side, I was curious, you called out strengthened fluid dispense product lines in electronics. I don't really recall hearing that product silo referenced. Usually we talk about adhesive dispense system so just wanted to flush that out. Greg Thaxton : Yes, Chris. This is Greg. In the past you may have heard, so for example, last year we talked through the year and suggested that test and inspection product lines were holding up fairly well where we were seeing softness was in the dispense side of our product line selling into these electronics end markets. So what we're suggesting this year is we've seen a return in that demand for the dispense side, test and inspection has been a bit softer in this most recent period. Both of those \u2013 maybe the same customer buying dispense and test and inspection. But we will often differentiate between those two major product lines. Sundaram Nagarajan : So think about, maybe to add a little bit more color to it. If you're thinking about fluid dispensing, really what we really mean is dispensing of various different things that our electronic customer would use in a component manufacturer or an end product assembly.A good application would be in electronic type of adhesives that gets dispensed as an underfill for a chip. So that when your phone drops it does not impact that particular chip. So that'd be a good way to think about it. Another good application is that our thermally insulating materials called TIMs are dispense systems in the electronics also used to dispense those TIMs, right. So that's kind of why we distinguish between dispense systems and test and inspection systems like Greg talked about. Greg Thaxton : And that comes into play sometimes on the operating margin line because as we've suggested in this quarter, dispense systems tend to carry higher gross margins than T&I. Christopher Glynn : Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question here comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Greg Thaxton : Good morning, Walter. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Walter. Walter Liptak : Greg, congratulations. I wanted to ask just a couple of questions, follow ups on kind of the order trends and what you're seeing because relative to other industrial companies, the order declines, even the minus 11 in ATS doesn't look that bad. Or did you see any project cancellations or anything in backlog that got delayed? Greg Thaxton : Well, really pretty minimal, we did have few push outs but not really any cancellations. So, very limited impact. Walter Liptak : Okay. From other companies, we are hearing about systems installations that couldn't happen, because companies couldn't get access to their customers' locations, because of the virus. Did you see any of that, or is that something that is becoming a bigger issue for you? Sundaram Nagarajan : Very limited. Say for example in an automotive plant, we've had some issues when they went to a complete hard stop. But nothing significant, nothing major for us at a total company level. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. And then on the cost side, I think, Greg, you mentioned that the spending levels in the second half would be about flat with last year, is that right? Greg Thaxton : Yes. If you look at the spending level for last year's third and fourth quarter, that gets you in the ballpark of what we would expect to see in the back half of this year. Walter Liptak : Okay. And I heard the CapEx, it sounds like you're not making any changes there? Greg Thaxton : Correct. Walter Liptak : But it did sound like you did do some cost control. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about, what it is that you're doing to try and hold back the spending? Did you do any furloughs or layoffs, any kind of pay related cuts or cutting back on bonus accruals, because of the virus? Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. Walter, let me sort of give me a broad overview and then probably get Greg to give you a little bit more color and detail on it. In general, we are in a very strong position. We really want to make sure we stay invested in our innovation. We want to stay invested in our customer-centric business model. Really we want to stay invested, be positioned to participate fully and win in the recovery.So that's really an overarching theme. But given the environment, we're going to be \u2013 going to take a conservative approach to our spending levels, and we have acted on few cost control measures discreetly in the quarter, that certainly helped the decrementals, maybe let me get Greg to talk you through a little bit more detail on those aspects? Greg Thaxton : Sure. And Walt, we did not implement any programmatic reductions or compensation adjustments. Given that, the business has held up fairly well and all of our factories are producing products. So it's the Nordson team still serving our customers needs. So we did not implement any of those kind of actions. What we did do and fairly early in the year, without knowing how significant of a downturn we would be looking at, and we feel like we're still in a period of concern. We did what a lot of companies have done.We first started with travel and then other discretionary spending items, really cut back on those kind of things and we'll continue to manage the business that way with our eye on our order trends. But we haven't done any programmatic compensation or voluntary-involuntary retirement programs. We also have focused very closely on headcount, so where we had some attrition or some open positions, we've worked really hard. If they were not customer facing positions to not backfill those positions. So we're managing spending very tightly. Walter Liptak : Okay, got it. Thanks for that color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Chris Dankert : Hey, good morning, everyone, and congratulations again, Greg. I guess, Naga just to start off, one of the big focuses of your leadership has been, how do we turbocharge organic growth and really kind of drive that forward? I guess, any update on what the key initiatives are there? Is it further tiering? Is it increased R&D spend for product development. I guess, just any comments on how we get back to growth, as we kind of move out of virus phase hopefully? Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Chris for the question. So really \u2013 for us, it has been really, really important in this period of time to actively manage the business, but continue to stay focused and remain focused on our long-term priorities. And organic growth as I've talked about many number of times, is sort of the best and the greatest opportunity for Nordson. So for organic growth, one of the things that we're working on through is really transforming our NBS, Nordson Business System, to become this strategic growth framework, through which we would really drive sustainable profitable growth in the coming decade.It's really all about, what is fundamental to this framework is a data-centric segmentation approach to growth. Really using this data-centric approach to choose and invest in the best growth opportunities, so that at every one of our businesses, we want to have a crystal clear view of what is our A growth opportunities. What is our A customers. What are our A products. And really focus our entire business around serving those opportunities disproportionately when compared to others. So that's one of the key things that we're working on.And the second part of this framework is really integrating what makes the company really, really strong, which is our commercial excellence, our customer passion, along with our incredible innovation and market leading technologies. So preserving what we've got, adding one or two things to it. In addition, I would say, equally important for us to serve our growth, is to make sure that we continue to enhance continuous improvement within the company.The company has been on a five-year journey on continuous improvement, and I come from environments where there are other companies who have been around this for 20, 30 years. So we have an opportunity to learn that, but it is all in the context of driving growth, it's not in the context of \u2013 and so where we are, we have really worked hard in the last six to nine months, around transforming our NBS to become a strategic growth framework. That's one thing that the team has really worked hard at.Second is, we are in the process of implementing this framework in five pilot businesses, to really make it actionable within the business. Over the long horizon, what we expect is a holistic, a framework that is practiced with rigor and consistency across the company. And we believe such quality of practice is going to enable really top tier growth in the best opportunities we have, continue to sustain the innovation the company does, and become really best-in-class delivery, quality performance of the company really is.So, company has done a nice job of growth. So it's really, as we continue to grow, how do we sustain that growth, and how do we sustain it in a very profitable way. And so hopefully, that gives you some color as to how we're thinking about it, where we are headed, where we are today. Chris Dankert : Perfect. Yes, thank you so much for all the color there. If I could just kind of circle back to polymers for a moment, past several years, we've been going through kind of a manufacturing optimization cycle there. I guess, how do you feel about profitability there today? Is it executing within targets? Just any comments on further actions that may or may not need to be taken inside of polymers? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, this is a business that we have done a lot of work over the period of time to integrate in the business. We have recognized all of those savings that we had targeted to achieve through those plant consolidations. It's well on track and we continue to perform there. Chris Dankert : Perfect, perfect. Thanks so much. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Chris. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Naga for closing comments. Sundaram Nagarajan : While the near-term demand conditions are unclear, I am really excited about the future of Nordson. We have a solid foundation, fortified by diversity of business and our strong customer-centric business model. We'll continue to monitor this dynamic environment, to ensure that we are taking appropriate action to manage the business, while staying focused on our long-term objectives of accelerating organic growth, diversifying through acquisition, leveraging the Nordson Business System, and focusing on talent development. Again, thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, August 20, 2020, to report Nordson\u2019s fiscal year 2020 third quarter results. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our audio webpage at nordson.com/investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until September 3, 2020. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday. Additionally, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based upon Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2020 third quarter conference call. With me today is Joe Kelley, the new Chief Financial Officer of Nordson. I'm pleased to welcome Joe to the call this morning. Joe joined Nordson on July 6 and brings over 25 years of financial and operational expertise to Nordson. Most recently serving as Chief Financial Officer of Materion, a global advanced materials company. I'm very excited to have him on board. He's already bringing great energy and perspective to our leadership team. First, I want to thank our Nordson employees for their continued flexibility, resilience and commitment as we have navigated 2020. They remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and responding to the needs of our customers. Nordson products serve a very diverse set of end-markets, including medical, electronics, consumer non-durables and general industrial. This diversity has helped drive the relative stability of our results to this point in the year. By maintaining new safety measures, our team has risen to the challenge and continue to meet the needs of our customers who depend on us to help them drive efficiencies, enhance innovation and continuously supply aftermarket parts and consumables that keep their manufacturing lines running smoothly. While we remain focused on managing this dynamic environment, the Nordson leadership team and I are equally committed to making progress towards our strategic priorities of accelerating organic growth, diversifying through acquisitions, leveraging that Nordson Business System, and building winning teams. On June 1, we announced the acquisition of Fluortek, a precision plastic extrusion manufacturer in the medical device industry. Fluortek brings highly differentiated PTFE medical tubing expertise, which is complementary to our current value-added component offering for minimally invasive therapies such as heart valve replacement. Growing our Nordson Medical business continues to be a priority of our capital deployment strategy. We're pleased to have the Fluortek employees as part of the Nordson team. Also during the quarter, we continue to develop the next generation of the Nordson Business System, which we're calling NBS Next, Nordson's growth framework. Our new segment realignment, which unleashes an owner mindset at the division level, allows our teams to make decisions as close to the customer as possible. Using critical insights created by segmentation tools in NBS Next, our division leaders were empowered to prioritize investments and simplify non-value added tasks to deliver best-in-class product quality and delivery. Staying invested in what makes Nordson strong, our customer centric business model and precision technologies will position us to accelerate profitable growth when the economy recovers. I'll speak more about the business in a few moments but first I'll turn the call over to Joe to introduce himself and provide a more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joe Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. I am very pleased to join Nordson, which has a long-established reputation as a high quality company that consistently delivers top-tier financial results. I look forward to partnering with Naga and the leadership team to drive the next chapter of profitable growth for Nordson. We have an extremely solid and rich foundation on which to build and I am honored to be part of the team. With that in mind, let's turn our attention to the fiscal third quarter financial results. Third quarter 2020 sales decreased 4% compared to the prior-year third quarter. The decrease was primarily related to organic volume as unfavorable currency effects were offset by the benefits from the Fluortek acquisition. The company's diverse end market and geographic exposure, as well as broad product applications contributed to the relatively strong commercial performance in these challenging times. Our combined Asia region led the way by delivering 3% growth in the quarter. Gross margins totaled $281 million or 52% of sales in the quarter compared to $303 million and 54% of sales in the prior year. The 200 basis point decrease in margins is attributable to $1.2 million of inventory step-up amortization related to the Fluortek acquisition, unfavorable sales mix, and COVID-19 manufacturing inefficiencies and COVID-19 manufacturing inefficiencies. As our factories addressed employee safety needs in this challenging time with precautionary quarantining of employees, implementing social distancing, rotational staffing, etcetera, a combination of these three factors contributed to the lower gross margin percentage in the quarter. We anticipate the majority of these headwinds to be temporary in nature and forecast returning to our historical gross profit margin levels. Operating profit in the quarter was $112 million or 21% of sales, excluding nonrecurring items in the quarter related to cost reduction actions and the acquired inventory step-up amortization, adjusted operating profit totaled $120 million, a 9% decrease from the prior-year adjusted operating profit. EBITDA for the third quarter was $148 million or 28% of sales, which is a 7% below the prior year EBITDA of $159 million. Looking at nonoperating expense, net interest expense decreased $4 million or 37% from the prior-year levels, associated primarily with the lower effective borrowing rate. Other net expense increased $10 million associated with an unfavorable $5 million year-over-year swing in currency gains and losses and a $5 million increase in pension cost. $3 million of the pension increase was related to a noncash pension settlement charge associated with the prior CEO. Tax expense in the quarter totaled $9 million or an effective tax rate of 9% in the quarter. The rate was driven lower by a $12 million discrete tax benefit associated primarily with non-recurring levels of stock option exercises and deferred equity compensation. Excluding these discrete items within the quarter, the effective rate would more closely reflect the company's long term tax rate of 20% to 22%. Net income in the quarter totaled $87 million or $1.49 per share. Excluding non-recurring adjustments to operating profit, the non-cash pension settlement charge and discrete tax benefits, adjusted earnings were $83 million or $1.42 per share. This represents a 12% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings reflective of the 4% decrease in sales volumes. Cost reduction actions taken in the quarter to structurally lower the ongoing cost profile of the company totaled $6 million and primarily related to severance payments. These actions are forecasted to deliver annualized savings of approximately $11 million to $12 million. Looking at the segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions\u2019 sales decreased 6% compared to the prior year third quarter. Stable demand from product line serving consumers in non-durable and markets were offset by weakness in sales of product line serving industrial markets. Asian markets appear to be recovering from the lower COVID-19 demand levels. Operating profit for the quarter was $75 million or 26% of sales. Excluding $3 million in structural cost reduction and simplification actions, EBITDA was $86 million or 30% of sales, a decrease of 200 basis points compared to the prior year third quarter. Lower sales volume, unfavorable product mix and manufacturing inefficiencies tied to the pandemic safety measures drove the lower profit levels. Advanced Technology Solutions, sales decreased approximately 2% compared to the prior year third quarter. This change included a decrease in organic sales volume of 3% and an increase of approximately 2% related to the Fluortek acquisition. Currency impact was minimal. Sales volumes increases in test and inspection product lines, serving at electronics end-markets and stable demand in medical product lines were offset by weakness in fluid dispense product lines serving industrial end-markets. The stable demand in medical is reflective of strength in some product lines, offset by meaningful softness in the other product lines, more closely tied to elective surgery. It's important to note that the definition of elective surgery has been broadened during the early months of this pandemic, particularly in the US. However, we are starting to see market signs that elective medical procedures are beginning to ramp back up. Within the Advanced Technology Solutions segment, reported operating profit was $50 million or 20% of sales in the quarter. Excluding one-time charges associated with the cost reduction actions and inventory step up amortization EBITDA was $71 million or 29% of sales in line with prior year profits despite the 2% decrease in sales. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and plenty of available borrowing capacity. Cash total $222 million and net debt was $1 billion. Ending the quarter with a 1.8 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. Free cash flow in the quarter was $82 million, which brings the year to date free cash flow conversion rate a net income to a 119%. Investing activity in the quarter total $135 million driven by the $125 million acquisition of Fluortek. Dividend payments were $22 million in the quarter and the company's board approved a 3% increase in the annual dividend effective in the fourth quarter of 2020. This marks the 57th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. We remain very confident in the cash flows of the company and are committed to returning a portion of the cash to shareholders in the form of a consistently increasing dividend. In summary, our top line has held up well considering the challenging macroeconomic environment. While we benefit from the diversity of the end markets we serve, the team has responded in a great way in supporting our customers and delivered solid performance while controlling cost in the quarter. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet maintain a strong balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to allow us to stay focused on long-term strategic initiatives to drive organic and inorganic growth. I'll now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Joe. I'm pleased with the performance the team delivered in a very challenging environment. I\u2019d like to make note of few areas. First, I appreciate the strong performance of our teams in Asia Pacific and Japan. They successfully managed through the challenges of COVID-19 earlier this year. Through it all, they remain focused on serving the customer. As a result, they delivered growth in the quarter. Revenue in the Asia-Pac region increased 3% compared to prior year. We had a very productive virtual review of our Asia businesses several weeks ago. Taking our executive team on a virtual tour of the facilities and new product pipeline, it is clear that the regional team is making meaningful progress in broadening in-country new product application and service expertise and resources, to serve our customers in the region. Second, I'd like to acknowledge the strong results of our test and inspection product lines, which are up double digits year-over-year. Test and inspection has been a focus area of our acquisition strategy. And we have built a robust offering of T&I product lines including Xray, acoustic imaging, bond testing and automated optical inspection capabilities. As advanced electronic components and semiconductor technology for 5G AI, and memory applications are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The need for T&I equipment is growing. Nordson\u2019s diverse portfolio of solutions and technical expertise is making us a go-to partner for global customers. In fact, our matrix inline automated Xray, offline DAGE Xray and bond testing, and SONOSCAN acoustic imaging product lines had direct sales in the fiscal third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, I'm encouraged that our teams are beginning to use a data-driven approach with NBS Next Segmentation Tools to prioritize investments to position their businesses for profitable growth and their recovery begins. In July, I participated in a progress review of the four pilot businesses who are currently deploying NBS Next. I'm pleased with the curiosity and experimentation in how our teams are beginning to apply data-centered insights to enhance customer service levels. Nordson\u2019s geographic and end market diversity is one of our greatest strengths. In this period, our Test & Inspection, Consumer Non-durable, and Medical end markets are helping balance the weakness of industrial end markets that are still under pressure. Our recurring revenue of aftermarket parts and consumables contributes to our relatively stable performance in these dynamic times. Looking at the fourth quarter, our order entry rate has come off of the lows experienced early in the quarter. The trailing four-week order entry as we enter the fourth quarter is approximately 93% compared to prior-year levels; and the 12-week order entry is approximately 90% compared to the same period last year. Backlog has decreased approximately 3% compared to the prior year. Based on these data points, we expect our fiscal fourth quarter revenue to be comparable to slightly better than the third quarter 2020 revenue. We also expect low single-digit sequential growth in earnings. I want to thank our colleagues around the world for their incredible commitment to our customers. This is an uncertain time for many and the team\u2019s strong execution is commendable. As always, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for their continued support. With that, I'll pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. First, on the medical side of the business, can you talk about how much of that is being driven by what is now being defined as elective versus non-elective? I guess I was under the impression that the elective portion was pretty minimal Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. As we entered the quarter, the definition of what is elective and what is selective, as you know, continue to broaden. And so, because of that, we did have some impact in our businesses. But if you look at our medical portfolio product offering, you have a fairly broad and diverse offering that not only serves the minimally invasive surgeries and such as heart replacement or stent placement. We also have a number of surgical, as well as fluid management product offering. And so, what we saw really was a surge in demand for our fluid management product offerings, pulmonary treatments. And so, it certainly helped us come in flat to last year in the medical business, less than what we have experienced, historically, 4% to 5% growth. So, it was lower than that, but it was flat to last year. And probably put it in context, what I\u2019ll tell you is if you take a look at medical device manufacturers, many of them in this environment are down mid-teens. And so, we're really pleased and it is slightly lower than our expectation, but very pleased that the team was able to come in on a flat year-over-year basis for the medical. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you for that color. And then just as a follow-up, can you maybe provide an update on what you're seeing in fluid dispense as it pertains to more to consumer electronics, 5G project activity and, kind of, what the outlook is there? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I -- what we see really is early stages of -- we had a good quarter last quarter, if you remember on the fluid dispense side for our electronic businesses. And what we see is continued project activity what you do find is in the electronic side, we're finding a lot of applications for these new complex components that go into AI applications, go into a number of, you know, the advanced 5G-related products be it out of electronics or as well as in mobiles that you have, you know, increased antenna requirements, you have increased camera modules, you have increased number of, you know, aeros as well as micro speakers and such. So, a lot of advanced components and we are seeing a lot of project activity on that. But primarily on the electronics side, where we see strength and had a really strong quarter, was in our test and inspection, which is more geared towards the semiconductor side of the business rather than on the components side of the business.. Operator : Next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeff Hammond : Hey, I just want to really understand, kind of the order trend through the quarter and, you know, you kind of gave some different numbers, you know, 12-week trend, 4-weel trend. Just kind of, really get a better sense of, you know, kind of what the true trend is in terms of, you know, things getting sequentially better. And maybe where particularly you're seeing things get sequentially better. Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. No. Thank you, Jeff. And so, what we're trying to do is probably talk to you a little bit about how we entered the quarter, right. We entered the quarter and we provided probably for the first time we talked about order entry rates in the way we\u2019re talking about it now. And I want to provide you some context for that, you know. We feel, you know, given the dynamic environment, it was important for us to provide you with more color than we normally do. So, that was the intent. And so, as we entered the third quarter, if you looked at the 12-week order rate, we think of the 12-week order rate as a little more longer term and suddenly stabilizes near-term environment. But given the current dynamics, we felt that was important for us to look at something shorter term so that we can see what is happening. So, that's why last quarter we provided you a six-week guidance, that's because six weeks was the time period that COVID had really hit in our quarter. So going forward, what we're thinking about is giving you a 12-week and a four-week guidance around how we are seeing \u2018til we get out of this dynamic environment. So, with that context, what I\u2019ll tell you is that the best way to think about the current environment is to think about it more sequentially. And we begin to see, as we navigated through the third quarter, sequentially the order trends for the total company was starting to improve, right? So, we entered the quarter, I would say, six-week order trends were more in the range of 11%. The short term was around 11% down. And as we exit the quarter, we begin to see that order trend is more like down 7%. So, that's sort of -- go ahead. Go ahead, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Okay. That's helpful. Where do you think you -- where are you seeing the best sequential improvement? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. So, I think I answered one part of your question and now let's go to the next part of the question, and probably take it two chunks, Jeff, is that, first, give you some color around the regions; and then, give you some color around the trends we are seeing by end market. So, if you think about the geographies sequentially, our order entries are such that from a geography perspective, in the US, the order trends are stabilizing, albeit at a little bit lower level that we talked about. Americas, which is, sort of, Latin America and Mexico, still remains challenged, given all that is going on in Mexico and Brazil, still remains challenged. But it is a very small part of our company. In terms of Europe, what we do see is a meaningful pick up and a trend up sequentially when compared to third quarter. And then in Asia, as you've seen in our third quarter numbers, we have reported a growth in Asia, but when compared to last year. And what we find there in Asia is sequentially that remains flat. It is not accelerating any further than that, but it is remaining flat. So, that's the regional picture. And if you look at about end-markets, what I would tell you is that some of the industrial end-markets remain challenged, right? So, businesses that have industrial exposure like our ICS business or our fluid dispensing in EFD, they remain challenged. Our medical business continues to be flat, order entry rates are flat and we seem to feel good about it. Our fluid dispensing in non-consumer, non-durables is flat to slightly up. And our plastic processing is flat to slightly up. And our electronic business, as we talked about, and test and inspection had a strong quarter and we find that we are flat there. So, hopefully, that gives you -- you know, it\u2019s a range of scenarios is what we're seeing in terms of trends for the various end markets. But essentially, it's a very dynamic environment. And what we find ourselves is managing to that dynamic environment. We're seeing some areas where sequentially things are stabilizing and maybe some improvement, but the industrial parts continue to remain challenged for the company. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. That's good color, Naga. Just on Fluortek, can you give us, you know, what kind of the annual revenue contribution, what that business has been growing at, you know kind of how the margin profile looks versus the medical business overall or at least you know the Advanced Tech segment? And just really where -- you know, what's the incremental kind of new product or market that you know this gives you that you didn't have before? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. So, I think let me give you some strategic color and maybe give you some update around how things are panning out in the first couple of months here. And then Joe can sort of provide you a little bit of color around contribution and such. So, it's a great little business. It's a niche business for us. It brings to the company PTFE tubing. So, this is the inner lubricious layer of the, you know, think about if you\u2019re trying to place a stent, you have to thread it through a tube that's in the patient. And what you really find is you have a lubricious tubing layer, which is inside that tube and that's really what this is, right? So, that is their major product line is the inner lubricious layer of those tubing that is used to place stents or heart valves and things like that heart valves and things like that. So, it's a very niche product. It's a great complementary addition to our delivery mechanism, core component offering that we have, right. Through Vention, we were able to bring on a very strong position in core components that help us in these minimally invasive therapies and we find this as a real nice add to it. In terms of the integration, we really like the business. The technology is really solid. As we have spent time within the business, it reaffirms our strategic thought about adding this, so we really like it, we like the people. Operations are coming along really nicely. Let me maybe turn this to -- a little bit Joe can add some color around financials. Overall, it\u2019s a value-added business. It's a differentiated business. It adds to the company. It doesn't take away, so. Joe Kelley : Yeah. Jeff, just to give a little more color, the annual revenue on this business is approximately, let's say, $20 million. And from a margin profile standpoint, it is comparable to our current ATS business. Operator : Next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to go into the medical piece for a little bit. I'm curious about how you're thinking about maybe pent-up demand for elective products. It\u2019s obviously a pretty important business to you where it had great success over the past. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the prospects for kind of pent-up demand assuming it's not too late for some people in search of elective procedures. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Chris, it's a great question. And I think that is -- as difficult as it sounds, but that is really what people are dealing with is that you know, surgeries that are needed are getting postponed and we are hopeful. But we do fundamentally -- to answer your question -- fundamentally believe that is a pent-up demand that that we would enjoy as surgeries come up. We're beginning to see early signs of hospitals opening up and certainly trying to, you know, increase the number of surgeries. It will be a slow ramp up. This environment, as all of us know and experience, is very dynamic. Things are up and down a bit. But in general, we are very convinced that -- remember also that these are specd in products in that these, you know, they have a great amount of stickiness to the sales orders because we are specd in through FDA approvals for medical devices in our customers. So quite frankly, you know, we feel very strongly about the growth drivers are on medical are solid, they have not changed. And in the short term, we would enjoy some meaningful pickup as the surgeries come back. But we, you know, our expectations are this is going to be a slow ramp, not a very fast ramp. You know, as you can imagine. You know, till we get past this next season of flu and get past to some level of normalcy, you know, this is going to be a little bit up and down. But even with those postponement what I really want to emphasize here is that the team came in with a flat revenue year-on-year, which is very strong performance, and that's because we have, you know, our product offering is pretty strong in fluid management, as well as pulmonary therapies, which we really have not talked about a lot but there are pulmonary therapies where our [indiscernible] get used. And so, we really like medical, we continue to invest here, we still see opportunities. So, hopefully, that provides you some color. Christopher Glynn : That's great. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is, just, kind of, update on what you're seeing in terms of momentum. You touched along, kind of, the handset features and things like that. But for 5G, both for infrastructure and for handsets, kind of, compare contrast. And you expect that ecosystem around 5G is likely your most robust vector in fiscal 2021 at this early juncture? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. The 5G activity, the activities remains strong, projects activity remains strong. We get invited to lots of different projects where we're working on. But it is, at least for the moment, it has got a lot of promise, as we have talked about in the last couple of quarters. Lots of promise, a big circular -- secular driver for this business. But not a needle moment -- needle mover at the moment for us. But why we are excited about 5G is not only just the handset, we really want to think about 5G in a broader terms, around the base station infrastructure build out, which is sorely behind. If you read, you\u2019ll really find is a lot of advertisement and marketing around 5G. But really, the usefulness of any of that only depends on -- if you are near the cell tower, right? Remember, these are fairly weak signals. So, you\u2019ve got to really be almost on top of one of these things to experience this awesome technology that has come in. But eventually it'll happen. So, we\u2019re excited about the base station opportunity. It\u2019s slow to roll out, as you know, there a number of geopolitical competitive things going on around that. That suddenly strains it. We certainly like all the advanced components that are getting developed so we really like that. Auto electronics will be a big player 5G because they're going to get incorporated. IoT devices are going to be another big area where 5G is going to get incorporated. So lots of different nuances to 5G beyond just the handset. But handset is probably what takes up most of the press time. So, overall good activity, still continuing to participate in projects, just not a big needle mover at the moment for the company. Christopher Glynn : Yeah, we know it's not now but it sounds like the timing visibility is kind of quixotic, I guess. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s a good word to use. Operator : Next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : A couple of margin questions here. So on the ATS, if you think about the sequential margins going into your fiscal fourth quarter, same mix pressures that appears to be the assumption to the same mix pressures that were there in the fiscal third quarter probably been good for the fiscal fourth quarter? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. I think, similar -- in ATS, the mix pressure will be there, is assumed to be there in the fourth quarter that was there in the third quarter based on some of the market demands that Naga just reviewed. Mike Halloran : That makes sense. Then the inefficiencies you referenced for the Industrial Precision business, maybe some context on those and how long do you think they linger? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. So our factories initially responded during the COVID crisis and, you know, and our efforts to keep the employees safe You know, in our efforts to keep the employees safe but continue to meet customer needs, we had significant factories. While they remained open, we were precautionary quarantining several people. When you think about some of our clean rooms, we also had to put in social distancing. And so our -- some of our manufacturing processes weren't as efficient from a direct labor standpoint. And so, we've been working through that, getting the proper PP&E, the proper staffing and people coming back from quarantine. And so, we're kind of working through those kinks. We've made progress, I would tell you in the quarter. From earlier in the quarter as it relates to manufacturing efficiencies and conversion cost rates. And so, we anticipate as we get used to the new normal to continue to improve as we go out throughout Q4 here. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. And then, last one. The Fluortek piece, obviously, really good that you were able to getting that some M&A done. But maybe just thoughts on the pipeline as it looks from here and what the basically the ability to convert some of that pipeline looks like as we sit here today? Sundaram Nagarajan : Mike, a great question. You know, as you think about M&A, you know, we've really talked about what is our focus. Our focus really is, you know, two big areas; scaling up medical, scaling up T&I are the two areas that we're very focused on. And if we find things that are very complementary, very next to our core, we wouldn't make some add-on. But it's really important for us to emphasize the context and, you know, our strategic rationale for anything we do will start with what makes Nordson, right, precision technology, customer-centric business model, two things that we look for. So, as we look at the pipeline, our pipeline has a number of opportunities that we continue to stay in touch. But given the environment, think about great companies that we would like to add to the portfolio, this is not particularly the time that they want to sort of transact. Meaning, given sort of reduction in their own outlooks and stuff, they're not particularly interested in acting on any of those and sort of take the wait-and-see approach. So, meaningfully, these opportunities are still existed. We're still sort of cultivating them, is probably the best way to put it. Should some of them happen to come to the market as we have been able to do with Fluortek, we will certainly act on them. But you can expect us to stay disciplined to what we feel are the most important adds to the company in the areas we're interested in. Mike Halloran : Great. Thanks there, Naga. Appreciate the time. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning. I had a question on -- in Industrial Precision. I was way off on modeling there and my expectations were there, because we've got some tougher markets within there with auto exposure, AND exposure, you have some energy exposure. So, I'm curious why -- did this -- did the trends in those specific businesses surprised you or is the resiliency in that -- in those tougher areas -- can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there I guess and your outlook for at least more difficult pieces? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. So, maybe let's first take the ones that are doing well and you know, so this is -- IPS, you know, traditionally has this is adhesive business that we have always been a very strong part of the company. History and the legacy part of the company and a core part of the company. A strong market leader, served number of recession resilient end markets, food and beverage packaging, nonwovens, and things of that sort. So, if you really think about that business, it has a very strong aftermarket component to it, about 50% of the market. So, really think about that piece of IPS as being very resilient. It has done well. You know, it had some slight down take but in general has done really well up to our expectations. Certainly early in the quarter, definitely helped by nonwovens in terms of masks, mask production. So, some of our customers shifting from diaper production to mask production. That's a great example. So, we benefited from some of our customers making those turns. And in some cases even added more mask manufacturing capacity we benefited from it. In that same -- in IPS, we also have our industrial end market facing businesses and those remain challenged. You know like our -- you know like any other pure industrial businesses as you think about CapEx deferrals, you know significant shut down in the automotive industry. All of that certainly has impacted those businesses. Those remain challenged. But you know, the diversity of end markets and diversity even within the segment certainly helped us perform fairly well. Sundaram Nagarajan : Right. So, that give you what you\u2019re looking for there Andrew? Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah, no. That's really helpful. And you know, and along -- kind of And along -- kind of, like along those lines though -- I mean, it seems the resiliency is there. But I guess in a post COVID world, are you guys thinking about any of these businesses differently? Or is there any, sort of, pruning opportunities that you can make to some of your areas that, maybe, you -- maybe your view had changed? Because it seems as though, I would think\u2026 Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. So, certainly, if you think of\u2026 Andrew Buscaglia : \u2026running in the same pace. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. And, I think, if you're asking a question around own portfolio and -- so, really our approach to portfolio management is a consistent review of all product lines on a yearly basis. And we really look at it through two lenses. One is take a look at it from a growth potential business. We\u2019re very focused on profitable growth, growth potential being an important lens. And second lens really being, what is the degree of differentiation? Really, what is the profitability of the businesses? So, as you consider those, we make decisions and if you, kind of, look back at the history of the company, when things didn't add up to our expectations in those areas, we did act on some product lines. And so -- so, it\u2019s a annual assessment and something that we do on a regular basis. Andrew Buscaglia : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport. Walter? Walter Liptak : I wanted to -- hi. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the industrial. And I wonder if you could help us understand any of the trends around -- we saw, maybe, things getting better in May and June, I think. And I wonder if with the virus cases going up again recently, if some of the cars that you're talking about around Industrial's because you see things weaken again. Sundaram Nagarajan : I think probably, Walt, the best way to think about it is, you know, we don't seem to find industrial strength in much. You know, you either just -- it seems to have stabilized at a lower level than our other businesses, right? So when we say it remains challenged, we're not saying it is going down further. We're saying it has gone down sort of in line with other industrial CapEx businesses but has not gotten back up. If it continues today, it remain challenged probably the better way to do it. Walter Liptak : Okay. And that's -- this is for you. I wonder, is it down because the customers are just cautious on their CapEx spending because I thought there was a higher ROI? Or is there a difficulty getting out with sales engineers into the field to sell and spec out systems? I guess is it slower because of this virtual world that we live in now and not being able to get out to customers to solve, new systems? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think it is really the larger CapEx spend where people are trying to sort of, you know, so think about our powder system businesses, right, it\u2019s a good example. In our powder system businesses, these are fairly significant capital outlays. And so if you are an industrial manufacturer and you have some demand issues, this is probably not the time that you're going to sort of put out a capital outlay for large systems. So that's kind of where we're seeing. But what we find ourselves is that, when somebody has in need, like our mass manufacturing, which is not industrial but more consumer non-durable, In that particular case, even in this virtual world, we are able to work with our customers, able to understand their space, able to spec-in what they need. Certain customers have some pretty stringent requirements early on for actual person visit, but that is all changing. We're all learning how to work in this new world. So, some of this -- a lot of the communication with engineers and such has actually picked up because think about -- you have engineers and design folks that have projects that need to complete but now are at home and are virtually working. They have plenty of time to spend time with their salespeople. So, quite frankly, the interaction with our customers have changed and actually have increased from an engineer-to-sales-person conversations, which in the past somebody is in a meeting or somebody is doing something else. But now, you find yourself having greater touch points with your customers. So, hopefully that provides you a color of how we are operating in this environment today. Walter Liptak : Okay. Yeah, it does. Thank you for that. And then, I wondered, just a couple of things on supply chain. We've heard about some parts shortages. You didn't mention anything about that, but I wonder how you feel about your supply chain or if you've made any changes there. And then, also, in MDS, you mentioned that four plants are doing the segmentation work as sort of a pilot project. I wonder if you could give us some -- a little bit better understanding of which segments that might be in, which factories, and what we should expect over, say, like the next six, nine months in terms of any profit improvement. Sundaram Nagarajan : So, maybe two questions there. Well, let me first\u2026 Walter Liptak : Yeah. Two questions, sorry, two questions there. Sundaram Nagarajan : Right. So, let me first take the question around supply chain. We didn't mention it because, you know, we had no issues, quite frankly. You know, we have a very strong robust supply chain team and process. And we have a great risk mitigation plan. All of that, you know, really played out the way we have anticipated. And so, really, did not have any issues. Early in March, we may have had a few hiccups here and there but they were all more ended up with higher freight cost than anything else. But in the past quarter really is a non-issue for us. And so, so supply chain, no issues, things running. So, everything is good. So, in terms of NBS Next, probably what is important to sort of provide you some context is that we look at NBS Next as a growth framework. And really, our pilot businesses that we have and it's equally spread among both the segments. And our expectation is, you know, we roll them out to really strong businesses. We\u2019ll not roll them out to our weaker businesses. But, you know, really, it's -- the total company is pretty strong. So, among the strong, we took our best businesses because we believe that looking at this from a growth lens is more important than anything else. And so, so what these businesses are really looking at is they're using at the heart of NBS Next is really a data-centric database segmentation process and that's what the teams are working on. We are, you know, the way I would characterize it, we have a proficiency model we look at it within the company and, you know, we think of them as learn to lead and coach. And I would say our businesses are in the learning mode starting to do. And, you know, our expectation is this will play out here over the next 12 to 18 months, and our goals really are not about, you know, how do we increase the profit margin as much as how do we have the best customers facing metrics on products, quality, and delivery so that we are able to accelerate growth when the recovery happens. So really positioning business to capture growth and have a crystal clear view of what are the top-tier growth opportunities for the company and how do we disproportionately invest in those areas. And, you know, with growth we will have incremental margin improvements, you know, that could come. But the exercise is not about taking out cost as much as it is really centered around growth. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great. Yeah. Good luck with the project. It sounds very promising. If I could just get one last one in. How are you thinking about pricing in this environment? You know, when do you typically do, you know, annual price increases and are there any businesses where you can get price even, you know, with this slowness going on in the economy? Sundaram Nagarajan : We typically look at annual price increases. As you can expect, there are input cost increases for the company, you know, just given the environment we're in and maybe the inflation, potential inflationary environment that we might enter in. So we have, in most of our businesses, as you know, our margin profile, our gross margin profile is pretty strong. And that is really because we add a lot of value, we create a lot of value, and we get paid for the value. But we're also mindful of the position where we are. You know, we have you know significant premium for the value we are creating. And so, you would expect us to be thoughtful, focused around growth, you know we are focused around creating value and getting paid for it. So, you know, pricing is not the biggest growth driver for us as much as making sure that we are participating in the growth as it comes. And then not just for inflationary costs should we -- should we encounter any of them. Operator : And at this time, I will turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. While the near-term demand conditions stabilize at a reduced level, I remain excited about the future of Nordson. We have a solid foundation fortified by the diversity of our business and our strong customer-centric business model. We\u2019ll continue to monitor this dynamic environment to ensure we're taking appropriate action to manage the business, while staying focused on our long-term objective of making a strong Nordson even stronger by accelerating organic growth, diversifying through acquisitions, leveraging the NBS Next growth framework, unleashing on a mindset, and focus on building winning teams. Again thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines are on mute. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I would now like to then the call over to your speaker today, Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, December 16, 2020, to report Nordson's fiscal year 2020 fourth quarter and full-year results. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2020 fourth quarter and full-year conference call. In this unprecedented fiscal year we did not just weather a challenging macro environment, we advanced our long-term strategy and achieved solid financial results. First, I want to thank our Nordson employees for their flexibility, resilience, and commitment as we navigated fiscal 2020. From the beginning of this pandemic, our leadership team has worked together to protect the health and safety of our employees and respond to the needs of our customers. Representatives from our global teams came together to share best practices and lessons learned as COVID-19 spanned the globe. We implemented new protocols of social distancing and face coverage, as well as regular cleaning and temperature checks, all of which continues to this day. By protecting our employees we were able to offer uninterrupted service to our customers, many of whom were deemed to support critical infrastructure. Nordson products serve a very diverse set of end markets, including medical, electronics, consumer non-durables, and general industrial. This diversity helped us drive the relative stability of our results. We have also stayed invested in our direct sales application and service model and committed to the innovation in our precision technologies. For the full-year, sales decreased only 3% compared to prior year, which is commendable in this environment. Joe Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. As Lara mentioned, we have provided slides that complement the narrative during today's earnings call. On slide number five, you see fourth quarter 2020 sales were $559 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter sales of $585 million. The decrease was primarily related to organic volume, offset by favorable currency and benefits from the Fluortek and vivaMOS acquisitions. Test and inspection product lines were solid again this quarter, and we continue to see growth in our product lines serving medical end markets. Sales decline in the quarter was largely driven by weakness in the industrial and automotive end markets. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Joe. Let's turn to slide 10. We're well positioned going into fiscal 2021. We have been operating safely and efficiently in this pandemic environment. We also have found creative ways to connect with our customers, whether it is virtual training and tech support or safely distance onsite product implementations. For example, already this team recently participated in the Annual PackExpo, which is the largest North American packaging trade show. It rose to the challenge of this virtual event showcasing our recent innovation through virtual demonstrations and videos. No matter the environment, Nordson employees remain focused on innovation and delivering on the needs of our customers. I'm also pleased with the engagement of the team in adopting our MDS next growth framework. This is truly about making a strong Nordson even stronger. Fundamental for this framework is to select and invest in the best profitable growth opportunities. This data-driven, customer and product segmentation approach, which we refer to as \"Strategic discipline,\" identifies where we create the greatest value for our customers. It is the new capability that our team is learning. Using a data-driven segmentation approach in a consistent and disciplined way, division leaders across Nordson have been working to define their strategic business priorities. This framework empowers our division leaders to take action on the data and focus on the areas where we win. Our decision to divest the screws and barrels product line was based on critical insights gained from this data-driven segmentation approach. Realigning our portfolio is another step forward in positioning Nordson for long-term profitable growth. This divestiture will improve earnings on a go-forward basis. It also gives our PPS leaders more time and energy to focus their resources on their differentiated and profitable product lines. This action exemplifies the power of NBS Next; identify our business's core, simplify the areas that distract you from focusing and growing with your core strengths. With consistent deployment of a data-driven growth framework will complement Nordson's great strengths of innovation, customer passion and culture. We'll continue to strengthen our newer capability by unleashing an entrepreneurial mindset at the division level while also building deep and diverse winning teams. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Your first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison, your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Great, thanks. Good morning, guys. Within the 5% order rate for this past couple of weeks, is there a noted vertical that's driving that or is it fairly broad-based here? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, Allison, good morning. Thank you for your question. Let's just maybe talk in terms of specific end markets, that's probably the better way to answer that question. So, if you think about our consumer nondurable business, what you're really finding is this is a recession-resilient end market for us, food and beverage packaging. Adhesives have been trending slightly up, and so our expectations are this is a better growth than what we have seen in some time. In the medical business, order rates remained stable. It still remains a dynamic environment. Remember that there are parts of our medical business that is certainly impacted by elective surgeries or selective surgeries. But we also have fluid component parts of our business that has been serving biopharma end markets, and so -- and disposable single-use plastics as well. So that part of it is doing really well. So, overall medical is stable, still continuing to grow. In electronics, I would tell the test and inspection business is really doing extremely well there, driven by advanced components in semiconductors, camera modules. In the quarter, we experienced double-digit growth, I would -- my expectations would be slightly lesser than that, but certainly high-single digits is sort of where this is trending. Our industrial business, I will tell you is challenged, but things are starting to look up. We expect some recovery in the first quarter. Our OEM businesses are moderating and automotive is a small part of the company. So, it's not one single vertical but differing rates of growth and trends that are trending up based on end market. Allison Poliniak : Got it, that's helpful. And then just touching on the divestiture, I know your comment about it not necessarily being quoted  Nordson longer term. Is there somewhat of an impact, a mix impact that you guys are thinking about when looking at these businesses as well in terms of the long-term profitability of the company, or is that sort of just as an insight at this point? Sundaram Nagarajan : Joe, do you want to take this one? Joe Kelley : Yes. So, when you think about the divestiture, as Naga mentioned in his script, this divestiture which we hope to conclude, I would say at the end of Q1 or early Q2, it will improve the ongoing earnings of Nordson, and specifically I guess to your question, the IPS segment, and will also improve therefore the profitability profile. But I would tell you, no different than Naga mentioned in his script, the most important and I think impactful is the prioritization and the allocation of resources to those more attractive growth opportunities, and so that's what really came through the NBS Next portfolio analysis, and driving that focus in terms of a growth framework going forward. Allison Poliniak : Great, thanks so much. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt, your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions, maybe just to follow up on the last point. This internal review process that led to this divestiture announcement. Have you fully concluded that at this point, and should we expect any additional portfolio shaping actions here in the more immediate term? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I -- Matt, thank you for your question. On NBS Next, portfolio analysis is a core part of NBS Next, which is really what we call strategic discipline, and it is based on product segmentation and customer segmentation. It is an ongoing process. So based on what we looked at today with our PPS business, our decision was this part of the business doesn't really fit the kind of long-term differentiation as well as the growth potential that we are looking to have in a business. So that's sort of what it is. But there are parts of our PPS business in this analysis, we figured out that it has some pretty strong differentiation characteristics, some technical advantages, which we believe will allow us to continue to grow this business with a Nordson-like profitability. So, for the rest of the businesses, this is an ongoing process. And there\u2019s not so much about what you're not going to do; it is as much as what you're going to do more of, right. So, as you think about our businesses, each of our divisions are going through a portfolio analysis, and they figure out what are the best growth opportunities, where do we create the greatest value, how do we move in and focus disproportionately our resources and investments in that part of the company. So, it's an ongoing process, and hopefully that gives you some color. Matt Summerville : Yes, thank you. And then as a follow-up, when you look at your implied organic guidance for the first quarter, probably flat to maybe down slightly because you'll have some FX tailwind and then some acquisition tailwind. Can you maybe talk about square that up a little bit with respect to your trailing order entry being up mid-single digits. And you mentioned some things maybe around the correlation with timing, et cetera. Can you maybe expand on that a little bit, Naga? Joe Kelley : Yes, I guess let me expand on  maybe Naga, you can expand on the trend that you're seeing in the orders. But you are correct. I mean if you look at our Q1 guidance as it relates to the revenue, we assume there FX rates similar to what we had experienced in Q4. And so therefore, when you look at the Q1 guidance, the FX and the acquisition will be favorable to about the same degree they were in our Q4 performance, which to your point implies organic growth relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Now, I'll point out now that organic growth of relatively flat is a significant improvement from the 7% decrease that we saw organically in Q4, and the 4% organic decrease in the full-year 2020. Also, I would add, if you look at what the revenue forecast implies for Q1 2021, not only is it up 2% to 3% over 2020 Q1, but it's also up over Q1 2019. So, said differently, from a run rate standpoint, we're starting out the year north of 2019 levels. And then one other comment I would make is in your observation, the 5% on the order entry and the 5% on the backlog. That 5% is calculated on a constant dollar basis. So that's really what's driving our optimism and our attitudes and our positive outlook as we enter Q1 2021. Now, that being said, you could clearly see there is a difference between timing and lead times in terms of shipments and order entry and backlog, and so that all has to be taken into consideration when we give the Q1 guidance, but when we look at that backlog and that order entry trend, that's what provides us that optimism heading into 2021. Hopefully -- Sundaram Nagarajan : Matt, what I would add to that is really that timing really depends on various different businesses, right. There are certain businesses, like our medical business, it's pretty much not a backlog kind of business; it's more a book and ship kind of business. But if you contrast that with an ICS business, that is more backlog-oriented. You get the order, then you have a large system that you have to put together. And then our aftermarket parts revenues are pretty much book and ship. And in our adhesive business is somewhere in between, it is more standard products that you're customizing or configuring to sell. So, depending on a business, depending on where it is there is a correlation of timing that we talk about. Matt Summerville : Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeff, your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Maybe just give us a 5G update. We're seeing new phones get rolled out with 5G; just what are you seeing in terms of a CapEx cycle, and on the mobile side as well as 5G infrastructure? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, let me talk about that broadly, Jeff. What we are seeing in the business is 5G related, but more broadly digital acceleration is really driving the electronic supply chain within our businesses. And most prominently where we are seeing this kind of activity in digital acceleration is in the semiconductor side of the business. So in the semicon business we're seeing some incredible, really nice demand patterns there that are emerging for our test and inspection business, and that is really what you're seeing the strength of. In terms of 5G, some of the semicon are related to 5G, but not entirely, right. This is really mostly because of a contact-free economy that is beginning to emerge, virtual conferences, virtual investor discussions, how you order your Christmas gifts, how you order your grocery. All of this is really an example of how this contact-free economy and digital acceleration that is really driving the growth of semiconductors. So you want to think about our electronic business not so much with the mobile revolution how we thought about our business then and within the last decade, where mobile revolution was really the biggest growth driver for us. But going forward, you want to think about our electronic business more in terms of digital acceleration, so that would mean two to three times GDP kind of growth over the long cycle. And on infrastructure it is still slow. We're continuing to get orders; we're continuing to work on those things. But it is not at the same rate as one -- you would expect. So, 5G in our mind is still an emerging opportunity. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then medical, you characterize as stable. And I guess I think this business is historically kind of a high single-digit, low double-digit grower, and maybe I'm just assuming stable means a little bit of growth. But I'm just trying to understand how you think the growth rate shapes up for medical and kind of these puts and takes around elective surgeries maybe coming back as we get vaccine distribution versus kind of comps from PPE equipment, et cetera? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, so I think that's a great question, Jeff. In terms of our medical business there are really two parts to the medical business that sort of allow us to have flat to low single digits, but you got to remember the context. The context really is our med device customers are down 10%-15%, so that's the context. And so why are we doing better then in that context, it's really because we have a fluid component business which is really servicing the biopharma end market as well as fluid components for COVID-type therapies. So, what you're finding is our fluid component business is doing incredibly well, which is muting some of the declines we're seeing in our interventional component business which is directly correlated to the selective surgeries and elective surgeries. So, big picture, if you think about our elective selective surgery kind of related component business, this is down a little bit -- down a bit. In the long-term all of the drivers, the ageing population, single-use component, outsourcing of med device components, all of those are intact as spins normalize we will return to mid to high single-digit kind of growth for this business, and that's our expectation. And right now in this transition, if you think about elective surgeries, in July they were down about 75%, they were 75% of pre-COVID levels, elective surgeries were. And our expectation was they were going to improve, but they have not. So as these elective surgeries improve what you're going to find is that we will benefit from it, and we will return to our mid single-digit, high single-digits kind of growth in the medical business. So, let me stop there. If you have any follow-up I certainly would be happy to answer. Jeff Hammond : No, that's great. Just maybe last one. I understand the uncertainty. Just give us a sense of what you need to see or I don't know if it's just a couple more quarters before you kind of flip to a more full-year kind of outlook. Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Joe, you want to take that? Joe Kelley : Yes. Our hope is that our visibility will improve, or I should say, our confidence as it relates to the volatile time that we're in with the pandemic, you know, here in Q1 and Q2, and so, our hope is that by the time we have our Investor Day that Naga referenced, we'll resume annual guidance at that time. Jeff Hammond : Okay, thanks so much everyone. Joe Kelley : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew, your line is open. Andrew Buscaglia : Guys, I wanted to ask on dig a little deeper in that Electronics component within ATS. So there's a lot of -- last year there's a lot of optimism growing into 2020. And obviously, there's a lot of things you had to navigate dealing with trade and then the pandemic. So I guess into this year, I guess how do you view things on a relative basis versus historical cycles for that segment, and so as the year progresses, I guess what are some of the times, we should be on board, see how that business shapes up? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, Andrew, thank you. The electronics business, what has happened with our electronics business is something that we've been talking about for a while, if you think about historical go back a decade ago, over the last decade, Nordson benefited by this incredible mobile revolution, where you went from 30 million phones to about 1.5 billion phones worldwide. It was an incredible time of change, incredible amount of things changing in the mobile technology, Nordson played contributed incredible technology and value to our customers benefited from it and that's what we saw. As you think about the next decade, and that's sort of what we are in right now, that mobile revolution is at once in a lifetime kind of event and what you're going to see is a much more normal kind of growth, still pretty strong growth, two to three times GDP. And so, the way we plan and think about our business is, we think about two to three times growth across the Electronics supply chain, not just mobile, but really, in our view, as we work with our customers and what we see in our businesses, what we find the greater drivers are digital acceleration. In virtual conferences, virtual way of doing business, virtual way of buying grocery, virtual way of ordering Christmas gifts, many different ways you think about it, this virtual economy, this contact economies continue to grow, which is leading to digital acceleration on infrastructure in capabilities. Certainly, all of this adds to supply improvement and order trends that are across the supply chain. And Nordson has done a really nice job over the last decade to diversify from just one particular product category to multiple semiconductors, components and products PCB, so we're diversified across electronics supply chain, and so we'll benefit from that, and we diversified into test and inspection. And so, what you really see is this digital acceleration, all of this leading to complex devices, complex components, leading to 100% inspection, inline inspection in some cases, all leading to our test and inspection business doing really well. So, our expectation is two to three times. And it is a different kind of growth, when compared to what you experienced in the last decade. Andrew Buscaglia : Yes, okay. With this NBS Next, using data to kind of understand your business a bit better, you've obviously found that that's been in there, but what about -- is this influencing any change  adjacent some segment that you'd like to be in or is the focus going to remain on test and inspection and medical? Sundaram Nagarajan : So as you think about it, we didn't talk about this when we clarify it, our focus is going to be on test and inspection and medical, but really that is what was behind. At that time, we did not publicly talk about NBS Next because we were still in the process of building it, but really what drove our focus is focus on test and inspection and medical is really a concerted view inside the company on how the portfolio was, and where was the greatest growth opportunities or the most differentiated parts of the company, which have the greatest growth potential is sort of what it led us to this focus around testing, inspection and medical. We have  looking for new market spaces that have characteristics that are very similar to Nordson, do we like the company  potentially, what is the level of differentiation? So should we ever run out of ideas? We don't rule out the opportunity to expand into a newer space should that need to happen. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Thanks, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Saree, Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you, and good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Saree. Saree Boroditsky : How does the MDS next portfolio analysis. Was there any businesses or product lines that you found were being underfunded that you want to focus on growing organically going forward? Sundaram Nagarajan : I think that's a great question. That is one of the things that we are really laser focused on is, this decision also -- there are two ways to think about this. One, it's a consistent, disciplined way of looking at opportunities in the company, but more importantly, that analysis and that decision making now happens at our division level. At the company level, it is great to understand where you want to be, but it is even more powerful when you look at the businesses and you look at some segments within the business where the greatest opportunities are. And as our division leaders have set their strategic goals priorities, what we're finding is that our leaders are making those decisions. The company has done a really nice job of staying invested in customer passion and staying invested in innovation. So I wouldn't say there is a complete switch, but are we discovering opportunities? Yes. And I think I am more excited about the fact that now these decisions are made much closer to the customer, much closer to action and knowledge. And I think that's probably the shift that we're making. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you. And then lastly, as we think about the backdrop for industrial spending next year, what are you hearing from customers as far as appetite for capital spending? Sundaram Nagarajan : As we talked a little bit about how the industrial business remains challenged, but we're starting to - from the middle of the year to now sequentially the orders that continued to improve and continue to grow. And we see some of that in our industrial businesses. So as we think about it, remains of dynamic environment, but our expectations are that it is trending up, and we expect some recovery in the first quarter. Saree Boroditsky : Great. Thanks so much for answering my question. Joe Kelley : So I would just add your comment on the MDS. Next, if you look at our SG&A, we did take several actions during the back half particularly of 2020 to lower our structural costs. That said those actions were very strategic, focused on business as identified in areas, identified through the MDS next framework. At the same time, it also allowed us areas where we wanted the best, as Naga mentioned. So, if you look at our product development costs on the full-year in the quarter, it was actually flat for the full-year, up in the quarter. So there are areas where we continue to invest, and there are areas where we are taking strategic I would say structural cost reduction actions. Saree Boroditsky : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike, your line is open. Mike Halloran : Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Mike Halloran : Some thoughts on the margin profiles as you worked through fiscal '21. You could just help us and put and takes. How are you thinking about incremental margins with some new structural cost improvement initiatives, can provide as a tailwind mix, any other puts and takes when you think about obviously the divestitures coming up that'll help with the mix, but beyond that, how should we think about some of the key buckets in the fiscal '21? Sundaram Nagarajan : Okay. Mike, I think in general, let me give you a broad -- broadly how we think of that business. And then, Joe can walk you through the puts and takes and all of that, right? So, in general, the expectation for us is that as our revenues grow, our expectation on incremental should be north of 45%. That's sort of how we are thinking about it in the business. So, it then allows us with the 54% growth  an ability to invest back in the business to continue to grow. So with that, why don't I get Joe to talk to you about the details of the various puts and takes? Joe Kelley : Yes. When you think about the incremental margins, I mean our guidance here in Q1 I think are high incremental margins sequentially and our stay on year-over-year basis because that is where you are seeing the benefits of some of those structural cost reduction actions in the Q1 numbers, but I will go back to Q4 and I'd just point out, I mean quite please with IPS, 30% OP as a percent of sales. And that was nice sequential incremental margins there when we look at it compared to Q3. And so it just -- it highlights that that particular business when some modest growth can really drop some nice incremental margins north of 50%. And so, that 30% is back to the Q4 2019 levels, but also even to at Q2, Q3 back in '19 when that business is north of $300 million doing 29 - 30% margins is something it can do. So, it's nice to see that bounce back from the Q3 which was a little bit depressed. Some of those of items, we view it as temporary. And it is nice to see that they were temporary in nature. Mike Halloran : And then on the capital deployment side on the external, obviously internal is the priority, but what does the acquisition side look like? How are you thinking about buybacks, anything like that? And what the prioritization looks like in '21 as well as what the opportunity side how realistic would be to move the needle on the acquisition side? Joe Kelley : Yes. So from a priority standpoint as you mentioned, organic generally generates best return at the lowest risk. And so, we continue to organically invest in business. That being said, it's relatively capital light and doesn't demand a lot from our free cash -- of our cash flow from operations which are quite strong. And so, we are committed dividend payer as you know and dividend increaser. We would like to do share buybacks to offset dilution, but beyond that we are really focused on the acquisition side. And, it's been a challenging 2020 and the M&A market. That being said, quite pleased that we are able to make progress with the Fluortek, with vivaMOS and then the announced divesture as well. I will tell you that we are no different than the factories who are learning how to operate and produce products safely in this environment. The M&A community is also figuring out how to do deals in this environment. And so, the market for M&A I would tell you is improving. And so, we do remain active. We are very strategically focused based on the NBS Next framework that Naga has reviewed with you and where our growth opportunities are. So, we are actively I would say -- Mike, actively working to deploy capital through the acquisitions. And the pipeline is growing as I would characterize it. Mike Halloran : Appreciate the time and the color. Thank you. Joe Kelley : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher, your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about the -- just want to kind of go through high level, revisited the T&I momentum and review the compounding dynamics you have there. I am really curious about what you are driving in terms of succession pattern of new capabilities versus adoption of the iterations -- the technology iterations you have introduced over the past year plus, and how those two factors converge towards this idea of 100% online testing capabilities. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. And I think it's a great question, Chris. And it's an area that we are doing a lot of work in. And it is an area that has a lot of promise for the company. Just sort of step back a bit, if you think about our test and inspection business today, it has two major -- maybe three major product technologies. First is x-ray inspection. Second one is acoustic imaging. Third one is mechanical testing, where we do some wire bond testing. We do optical inspection as well, but it is a smaller part of the company. So, major product lines really be are X-ray imaging, think about acoustic imaging and then think about mechanical testing. We fundamentally believe that the acoustic imaging and x-ray imaging are going to continue to grow for us, as these devices get more complex, and a couple of applications. So if you take a little bit one more step deeper into the product application. So if you think about a complex semiconductor package that is being manufactured. In the past, they were sampled, and you ensured that the manufacturing process was stable and the product quality was really good, but as these devices get a lot more complex, now you're really interested in, because these devices now have greater functionality, the risk of failure and the potentially impact on the customer's experience is so high that these semiconductor packages are now getting inspected 100%. So that's sort of a need. In terms of what is it that customers are looking for, the customers that are really looking for not only whether the bonds were made, but there is more looking for all the things that they need? Is it in there? Is it in the right side? So, now all of a sudden 3D metrology with extra inspection becomes a lot more greater and real and online rather than what was a good feature to have. So as it translates to the company what it really needs is do we have the resolution, which we've always been really good at, do we have the speed, and do we have the lowest signal noise level, right? So those three things really don't matter. As you think about the new acquisition, we made it as a technology acquisition CMOS sensor, image sensor, and it provides all of those things, it provides a unique combination of higher speed, higher resolution and lower noise. And so as we build out our inspection capability, you'll then have to find those ad technologies that allow us to help our customers inspect things more in real time and at a faster rate, higher resolution, no work lower noise level. And we're going to add capability that allows us to do more 3D metrology than we have done in the past. So that's another one that's coming about. And I would say the third is today our business is very focused on electronics. We do - and we're beginning early stages of diversifying that exposure into adjacent end markets. And this vivaMOS acquisition allows us to now think about, is it possible for us to become a component supplier. It allows us to sell our image sensors, and allows us to sell our tubes into end markets to other OEMs, in end markets that we don't have a right to play in, but we have a right to be a component supplier because we have the best resolution in the market. We have the best lowest noise level on the market. We have highest speed. So it's an exciting time in the test and inspection business. It's an area where we will continue to invest in. One that we did not talk about is some early days here is this defect classification is another big thing, right. I talked to you about image speed low noise, but also defect classification that's important because that allows our customers again to identify whether it's a good chip package or a bad chip package. So a lot of details there, but hopefully that gives you how we're thinking about the business, where this had it. It clearly has some good opportunities for organic growth, and opportunities for us to acquire. Again, we'll be really thoughtful as always what we acquire, how we acquire, it, wasn't a discipline around acquiring things that sake, we're not going to acquire undifferentiated, commoditized products interested in selection, we're going to be very focused around what makes Nordson strong, which is position technologies, customer intimacy, really customer critical applications and how we add value and create value. And so that's where we're going to be focused on. Christopher Glynn : That's great detail and great bang for the buck on the question. Thanks. Just a little housekeeping to close-up, D&A and bias on working capital through the cash flow statement for fiscal '21, any comment there, Joe? Joe Kelley : Yes, so quite pleased with our progress on working capital liquidation there in 2020, particularly the strength in Q4, we improved I would say our efficiency around the AR side. And so when you look at the cash flow statement, you'll see it was on the AR and it's not just selling 3% or 5% less than we did in Q4, I should say. It was really improving the DSI, as we implement NBS Next and see that rollout, I think going forward, there's an opportunity on the inventory side. So really anxious as we go into 2021 is to continue to focus on the cash flow, and do feel that there's some opportunities from an inventory efficiency side there. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Do you have a D&A figure for fiscal '21? Joe Kelley : D&A, I don't have a figure yet, it's going to depend on the timing of this , or I should say, the screw and barrel divestiture. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks. Joe Kelley : Yes. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Chris, your line is open. Chris Dankert : Hey, good morning, thanks for fitting me in here. Ran over this quickly, but just want to make sure I'm understanding the dynamic when we're looking at the ATS business specifically, as you characterize Medical stable, Test & Inspection up double-digits, high singles, that really does kind of give the sense that that Dispense was extremely weak in the quarter kind of despite some of the other strength going on in PCBs and Semi's. Am I thinking about that, right, and I guess, just what was the key driver of the weakness in the quarter on that core dispense business and advanced technology? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I think it's a good question, Chris. Our dispense business as you think about it, we've benefited in the last decade from this mobile revolution, this incredible investment on mobile revolution. We're benefiting from some projects that are related to semiconductor in that business, certainly benefiting from some projects in some newer features, but not to the same extent as we've benefited in the past. So, you had a competition there for that business that we're working our way through. In general, our expectation for that business is as this competitions get worked out, what you're going to find is going to be a nice 2% to 3% grower, isn't going to be the same kind of grower that it was, but the company was very thoughtful in diversifying into Test & Inspection and so Test & Inspection all of a sudden is a really nice growth engine for us in the semiconductor side, and we'll benefit from it. And hopefully, that gives you how we're thinking about it internally. Chris Dankert : That's fair. That's fair. Thanks, Naga. And then I guess, just lastly from me, when we look back at the other half the business, dispensing I guess the coatings business versus hot melt something that coatings is down pretty substantially even really driving though the weakness in the fourth quarter here in hot melt was much more stable. Is that correct again, just kind of thoughts going forward? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, yes, I think but you want to remember our coatings business was one of those businesses that had order substantial amount of orders slipped from third quarter of '19 to fourth quarter of '19. So if you think about fourth quarter by itself, yes the coatings business had a significant headwind, but if you look at it from second half perspective for the coatings business was about mid-teens still pretty high and was essentially one of the things. So there is a comp issue and there is an industrial exposure issue. And you're right about to being in a much better place. Joe, do you want to add some color to it? Joe Kelley : Yes, I'll just add one thing, two questions there, the fluid dispense within ATS and then the ICS business within IPS -- sorry, sequentially we are seeing some nice improvements there. Those are the businesses that have the heavier industrial exposure. And so, when you talk about Naga's comments as we went through the back half of '20, we saw that steady improvement in order rate. So while it's down year-over-year, from a trend standpoint those businesses are seeing some improvements sequentially. Chris Dankert : Got it. That's all very helpful color. Thanks so much guys. And best of luck in the '21 here. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Chris. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Naga for closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : All right. Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. We are well-positioned going into fiscal 2021. We remain focused on our long-term objective of making a strong Nordson even stronger as we deploy NBS Next growth framework to prioritize organic and acquisitive growth opportunities while also unleashing an owner mindset within our customer-focused divisions. We wish you a happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Nordson Corporation's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call.  I would now like to hand the conference over to Lara Mahoney. Thank you. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, February 23, 2021, to report Nordson's fiscal year 2021 first quarter results. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2021 first quarter conference call. Nordson was well-positioned as we entered fiscal 2021. Our COVID-19 safety measures and protocols have ensured we continue to operate safely in this environment. This has allowed us to be agile and responsive to the needs of our customers who serve a very diverse set of end markets, including consumer non-durable, medical, electronics, and general industrial. During 2020, we remained invested in what makes Nordson strong, the direct sales model and our innovative position technology portfolio. Additionally, we were successful in advancing several aspects of our long-term growth strategy. Using the NBS Next growth framework, our employees have been investing their resources in our best opportunities for profitable growth. While this remains a dynamic macroeconomic environment, our team has delivered a very solid first quarter on both the top and bottom lines. It is noteworthy that our first quarter sales and profits are about both fiscal '20 and fiscal 2019 comparisons. In particular, our Industrial Precision Solutions team delivered strong year-over-year growth benefiting from improvements in consumer non-durable and industrial end markets. They also achieved profit margin expansion as volume leverage, improved sales mix, and manufacturing efficiency gains, all combined within the quarter. Joseph P. Kelley: Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide #5, you see first quarter 2021 sales were $527 million, an increase of 6% over prior year's first quarter sales of $495 million. The increase was primarily related to organic volume and favorable currency, with additional benefits from the Fluortek and vivaMOS moss acquisitions. The organic growth was driven by strength in consumer non-durable and industrial end markets, plus particular strength in the Asia region. Gross Profit totaled $290 million, or 55% of sales in the quarter compared to $263 million or 53% of sales in the prior year. This 190 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by the combination of volume leverage, improved sales mix and benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020. It is noteworthy that 55% is the highest quarterly gross margin since the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating profit in the quarter was $109 million, or 21% of sales, a 39% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $78 million. It is here in the operating profit growth rate that you see additional benefits from the fiscal 2020 cost reduction efforts as SG&A decreased 4% from the prior year first quarter level of $188 million. EBITDA for the quarter was $135 million, or 26% of sales, which is 26% higher than the prior year EBITDA of $107 million. Looking at non-operating expense, net interest expense decreased $3 million or 28% from the prior year levels associated with reduced debt levels and a lower effective borrowing rates. Other expenses increased $2 million, largely driven by currency translation losses associated with the weakening of the U.S dollar. Tax expense in the quarter totaled $20 million or an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Joe. Let's turn to Slide 9. First, I want to thank the team for delivering a very strong first quarter. Over the past 2 months, Joe and I have been actively engaged in business reviews and virtual facility tours around the world. I'm very excited about the energy within our divisions and the steady deployment of the NBS Next growth frame work whether that is in how teams are organizing data to fuel decision making, or the prioritization of best products in the manufacturing processes. We are also seeing the strategic analysis of product lines to identify the best growth opportunities and filling the sales funnel with these targeted accounts. One tangible result from the strategic discipline element of NBS Next was seen on February 1 2021 as we successfully closed the divestiture of our screws and barrels product line. Our decision to divest this product line was based on critical insights gained from the NBS Next data driven segmentation approach. While this business is a respected leader in the plastics industry, it did not fit Nordson's profitable growth objectives. By divesting this business, we will focus our resources on growing more profitable product lines that will deliver on our long-term objectives. We believe our remaining PPS division as the right degree of differentiation and related technical competitive advantages to deliver over time, Nordson like growth and returns. I would like to take a moment to recognize recent changes to our Board of Directors. At the end of November, we welcome Dr. John DeFord, the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Becton, Dickinson and Company; and Jennifer Parmentier, Vice President and President of the Motion Systems Group of Parker Hannifin to our Board of Directors. John's technical and regulatory experience in the medical device end market will enrich the strategic perspective of our Board as we continue to grow in this attractive market. Jenny brings strong operational, industrial and M&A experience to the Board, which will be important as we continue to deploy our NBS Next growth framework. John and Jenny's appointments follow the retirements of Joe Keithley, Randy Carson, and Lee banks. I would like to thank Joe, Randy and Lee for their many insights and contributions throughout their time on the Board. Our Board now stands at 9 Directors, 56% of whom are diverse. The average tenure is now 7 years. I would also like to remind you of our upcoming Virtual Investor Day, the morning of March 30. We will share more about the ongoing deployment of NBS Next, as well as our long-term strategic priorities and financial goals. We will also use this time to give investors a better understanding of our strong competitive advantage, differentiated product portfolio and diversified end markets and growth drivers. Please visit our website to register. Operator :  Your first question is from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So sales guidance, I guess implies around 5% growth for the remainder of the year, which is slightly below one quarter despite having some easier comparables. So could you just talk about if there's anything that you're seeing in the market that makes you more cautious on improving growth rates? Sundaram Nagarajan : Joe, you want to take that? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. So when you think about our sales guidance, Saree, for the remainder of the year, you have to consider that we have the divestiture of the screw and barrel business. So excluding the divestiture of the screw and barrel business, it suggests a 7% to 9% growth rate when you look at our guidance. Now, I will remind you that is comparable to our Q1 growth rate excluding the screw and barrel business, which was over 7%. And entering the Q2, our backlog is approximately $500 million, which is approximately 7% above when we entered Q2 last year. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks. That's a lot of great color. And then more of a high level question, there's been a lot of semiconductor capacity announcements out there. Could you just talk about how you could benefit from this expansion activity? And have you seen any of this flow through your order rates yet? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Saree, that's a great question. As we have talked about semiconductor devices, and the opportunities for Nordson, this is an area of particular strength for the company. Clearly, we see advantages for us in the test and inspection, as well as our dispense business. What you find is that are two things going on here. With semiconductor device demand increases, you're going to get capacity additions. Now, those capacity additions will take the form of both dispense product lines, as well as test and inspection product lines. But in the shorter term, you're going to find more test and inspection because our customers, it takes a little bit of time to bring on new capacity. But what they are really spending a lot of time is using test and inspection to improve yields, help them meet some of the accelerating demand. So very excited about this. This is a great opportunity for the company, well-positioned to win here. So if you have any additional questions, certainly we'll be happy to answer them. Saree Boroditsky : I guess one more then. You talked about renewed growth in the auto end market. Could you just talk about what you're seeing in that space, and then how Nordson can benefit from the increase in CapEx and facilities for EVs? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. On the EV side, clearly we\u2019re -- this is an emerging market for us, an emerging opportunity, where we find the greatest opportunities are in the battery manufacturing. So you could think about batteries, they are put together in many different ways. One of the ways is, you're combining multiple cells. So we have a lot of opportunity in manufacturing of the battery. That is one way. The second is that you could think about our test and inspection. Our test and inspection business definitely benefits from power electronic components like IGBTs, which are increased in demand, becoming more complex, and hence we have an opportunity here both to benefit in battery as well as in electronic components. Saree Boroditsky : That's great color. Thanks for taking my questions today. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions. Maybe just back to test and inspection, Naga, if you were to use a baseball analogy in terms of how much in line testing is being performed, and how much runway is in front of that business. What inning would you say we're in with what you're seeing in T&I right now? Sundaram Nagarajan : T&I, 100% inspection is early innings. So you see that a lot in auto electronics. You're beginning to see some of that in semiconductor, but clearly early innings. Matt Summerville : And then just maybe one on corporate expense. In the fiscal first quarter, I think it was some $8 million above the prior year that seemed unusually high. Can you talk about what drove that variance and what sort of quarterly run rate we should be utilizing going forward? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Hey, Joe, you want to take that? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. The increase when you look year-over-year, as I mentioned in some of my comments is from incentive comp. And so while that was a tailwind last year, it's a headwind this year. And so from a year-over-year standpoint, that's what you see in the drive in some of the corporate expense increase. When you think about it from a full year run rate, historically that fluctuates between $50 million on an annualized basis, and call it $65 million, depending on performance. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, guys. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Allison Poliniak : Just going back to the semi challenges that are happening right now, I know you talked specifically to that market. But are you hearing or any sort of project delays related to maybe your other electronics end market? Auto comes to mind just given some of the plant closures that have been happening lately. Any color there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, sure, Allison. No, we have not really heard a lot in terms of -- if you remember, we are more involved in setting up the line and in platform launches. We're not really in the direct production line, which is sort of where you're seeing some of the delays. So, no, we do not anticipate any delays, have not noticed. But what we are seeing is pick up in expectations from specifically auto electronic customers who are looking to ramp up capacity by increasing yield. And so you see that in test and inspection growth. Allison Poliniak : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just looking at leverage, obviously, a very healthy range for you. As we're sort of hopefully getting out of this COVID, and the COVID challenges, any thoughts or changes to how what you would view as an optimum leverage range for Nordson going forward here? Sundaram Nagarajan : Joe? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. So, we ended the quarter at approximately 1.3x leverage. We continue to be very comfortable at leverage ratios higher than that. And when you think about 2x to 3x leverage, we would be comfortable. We have the capacity to go up based on our current debt structure to 3.75x. But as we look at it and look at the opportunities, we do continue to prioritize M&A and would be looking to take that leverage ratio up closer to the 2x to 2.5x half range to support that. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Hey, good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Chris. Chris Dankert : I guess, Joe, definitely appreciate the comments around incremental and how guidance moves forward from here. But I guess to dig in a little bit on an IPS, specifically, 1Q typically the low watermark for IPS margin. 29% is quite impressive, I guess, is that level of margin execution repeatable? Do we build from here as the rest of the year is flat, good performance? Just any -- if you could put that 29% margin number in context, that'd be really helpful. Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. Part of what we see going on here is this acceleration of demand in Q1, I think makes some of our normal seasonality a little bit in question. Perhaps this acceleration overrides the normal seasonality you would see throughout the year. But as specifically related to that 29%, they had a very favorable mix, particularly parts, volumes were up and there was nice leverage going on. It was in that business where we did take some cost out. If you recall, cost action there in Q4, which was delivering benefits here in Q1 to the cost structure. But when you think about that segment going forward, the divestiture of the screw and barrel business will provide further margin improvement to that. So when you think about it going forward, the margins there should expand off of this with the references as a very high watermark here in Q1. Chris Dankert : Got it. And not to press my luck too much here, but I guess, are you willing to break out what the impact of mix was on the quarter? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes, we're not willing to -- I mean, you referenced 29% was a very high watermark, we haven't seen that since back in 2019. And so we're pleased with the profitability levels back there. At this lower range, a lot of it is coming from the improvement in the mix within the business. So if you think about NBS Next, and as we focused on our most profitable opportunities, really that has allowed us not just to take cost out, but also to drive an improvement in the sales mix. And so that's what you see in that 29%. Chris Dankert : Got it. Got it. Sundaram Nagarajan : Chris, one more of that I would add is that if you think about the volume, the volume leverage in this business is really good. And so we had a pretty strong volume growth that helped us deliver some pretty nice incrementals. So you're-- you've got an accelerated recovery that is helping us and as you go into the out quarters, that volume is going to come down a bit. But we're comfortable with the current margin rates, but I think it's important to remember the volume play here as well. Chris Dankert : Yes. Yes, thank you for that color. Really appreciate it. And I guess one last one for me. What is the FX benefit assumed in guidance when historically, FX swings can be fairly significant on earnings? Just any comment on FX and kind of what you're baking in here would be great. Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. FX in the quarter proved to be more favorable than we had originally anticipated. And so for our forecast, we are assuming the current exchange rates maintained throughout the remainder of the year. And so that had or that benefit should continue. It starts to moderate a little bit on a year-over-year basis in Q4. Chris Dankert : But that should still be not dipping it down, but about a 2% to 3% benefit for the full year at current rates. Correct? Joseph P. Kelley: You are correct. Chris Dankert : Got it. Thanks so much. Joseph P. Kelley: Yep. Operator : Your next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning, guys and gals. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : Was curious, couple questions on IPS. Wondering if any markets or production processes that you serve are currently showing any nice shifts to adhesive centric assembly from stitch or fasteners? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Chris, a couple of things. First and foremost, the adhesive, core adhesive business is pretty strong. One of the areas that we're beginning to see some really nice pickup is in electric vehicles and in battery manufacturing. It's an area that we continue to benefit from. Ongoing automation across a wide variety of application is also beneficial to this business. So think about adhesive dispensing allowing our customers to automate their manufacturing processes. So we see a lot of benefit there. Not any particular one end market the other, but I would say, a broad set of end markets. Clearly, consumer electronics, interestingly enough, as you have some wearables and other new consumer opportunities. So if you think about our adhesive business, really is depend -- it is -- it has grown mainly through new applications of big lever, and that is pretty strong and we continue to benefit from automation. So the two things I would tell you on a big driver would be battery, and number two automation. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Thank you for that. And wondering relative to the two segments within your organic outlook, do you see ATS kind of pulling up to where IPS started the year and kind of coupling the type of organic growth you expect for the balance of the year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. What we have really -- let me give you some end market trend and then Joe can add some color about how we\u2019re thinking about the actual growth rates. Yes, what we expect is in the back half -- there are two things here. One is, if you know our medical business, as COVID eases and as elective surgeries come back, we said expect our medical business to get back to the high single-digit rates in this back half of the year. So that's one big driver for us. The second is, you begin to see some very strong electronic orders in our business today that will show up in the second half as a growth driver for us. In terms -- so those two will certainly help our ATS business. One thing we have not talked about is that our medical fluid component business, which is primarily driven by biopharm applications has a solid growth in the quarter. We expect that to continue -- that continued strength in the out quarters. It's a big -- it's a small business today, but we are very excited about this opportunity. This is really because of all of the single use components. Christopher Glynn : Sounds great. Thanks. Just the last one, if I can sneak it in. The FX impact on the top line, does that still sort of drop through? Is it 2x to 3x multiplier to the earnings impact? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes, so the FX to the bottom line, our cost structure aligns, I would say with our sales structure quite well in terms of the FX, Euro denominated and GBP dominated costs as well as revenue. So that does flow through. There is a little bit of a margin expansion within our IPS business, when you see the dollar weaken against the euro and the GBP. Christopher Glynn : Thanks for the color. Operator :  Your next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Your line is open. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joseph P. Kelley: Good morning. Andrew Buscaglia : I just want to touch on the ATS. So, I thought we would see that turn to growth, just given a difficult -- just given like, we're laughing some easier comps. And your overall guidance really for organic growth isn't quite that high if you exclude FX, it doesn't really include -- it doesn't really seem to be assuming much of a snapback in ATS in the back half. So I'm just trying to figure out is this you just being conservative, or just the ATS segment hasn't quite grown. What do you say can grow 2x to 3x times GDP in 3 years now. So I guess what gives -- or can you give some investors some confidence that this growth is coming? Or is this conservatism? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes, so I guess when you think about the growth rate of 4% to 6% and going forward, it's important that excluding the divestiture, again, it's 7% to 9%. And so if you think about FX, that would suggest 3% -- sorry, 4% to 6% organic in that range. So just so we're clearly, I guess \u2026 Sundaram Nagarajan : Right. Joseph P. Kelley: \u2026 I think, places the components, so that's what we're suggesting. Andrew Buscaglia : Right. Well \u2026 Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, go ahead, Andrew, sorry. Andrew Buscaglia : No, no, you add. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Andrew, one of the things that I would add to is that on the ATS side, as COVID eases, our medical business today is primarily flat because COVID declined -- COVID related surgery declined putting a damper on our component business, but offset by very strong growth in biopharm, okay? But as COVID eases in the back half, we do expect this business to get back to high single digits in the back half. So, the ATS what we're baked in is we are expecting medical to come back. We certainly, on the electronic side, it is important for you to remember that broadly Nordson place in high precision applications, with -- what we are really good at is. Test and inspection is growing nicely for us. So that is baked in to our outlook as we forecasted it today. Test and inspection continues to grow. And if you think about electronic dispense business, we are seeing some pretty nice order entry that is starting to grow in the second half, maybe level set here on the electronics dispense side of our business. If you think about our electronics dispense business, what we're really good at is high precision reliable dispense at very high speeds. That's what we're good at. And those has great application across a broad category of electronic end markets, not specifically one particular product category, like a, I guess, smartphone or other things like that. What we are finding is that the demand is pretty high for this level of precision, driven by all of this digital acceleration that you're seeing, driven by automotive electronics. And so, what we really like here is that we have a new team in place that is looking, that is using NBS Next and looking at opportunities, clearly, what we are seeing is that mobile phone manufacturing has matured. It has matured, and hence, these applications don't require that level of precision that is needed. And so we've got a new team looking at -- really looking at this opportunity. But more focused around semiconductor package, more focused on the digital acceleration across a broad spectrum of end markets. And we're confident that this business gets back to mid single digits growth, and you'll start to see some of that in the second half of the year. Joseph P. Kelley: The other thing I would \u2026 Andrew Buscaglia : Yes, go ahead. Joseph P. Kelley: When you think about our growth rate organic of, let's call it 4% to 6%, don't forget that in 2020 our sales only dropped about 3% to 4%. So the drop off from '19 wasn't as significant as others. So therefore the bounce back opportunity is not as significant as others. Andrew Buscaglia : Yes, and I think, you said you sound like China had a good -- as expected, was pretty strong with Q2. It's going to be a little dampened over there. But I guess exiting the year in the second half, presumably, all three regions, China, Europe and U.S., you sounded like those all have to be -- you're assuming those are all growing in tandem exiting 2021. Yes, just I guess, based on easy comps and the pandemic lifting. Is there any other like regional, I guess, regional color you can provide that would \u2026? Sundaram Nagarajan : Andrew, I think you've kind of covered -- if anything, what I would tell you is that Asia is strong today, Europe is flat organically, we do expect that to change. U.S is starting to strengthen, but right now, it was slightly low in the first quarter. But I wouldn't add anything more than what you've already captured there. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your final question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joseph P. Kelley: Good morning. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask about the NBS Next, and can you maybe elaborate a little bit about the cost savings that you got that benefited this quarter versus the benefits from NBS Next? Is it possible to differentiate one from the other? Joseph P. Kelley: No, I mean, it's really not because when you say the cost savings that we referenced, I think at several points, when you step back and think about our cost actions, it was all driven by the strategic discipline within our NBS Next growth framework. And so as we focus on the best growth opportunities, we stayed invested in those opportunities, so that we could capitalize on that. And then where there weren't the best growth opportunities, that is where we took action to the right size, I would say, our cost footprint, or in the example of the screw and barrel divestiture, improve our profitability there. So at the heart of it, Walt, I would tell you the margin expansion when we referenced sales mix improvement within IPS, when we refer -- reference benefiting from the cost structure reduction actions, all of that is rooted in the NBS Next strategic discipline growth framework. And so it's really, when I look at it -- when we look at the incremental margins of 97%, we say that's a lot of NBS Next delivering the benefit. Walter Liptak : Okay. Okay. Let me try it this way. As you look at your SG&A overall for the remainder of the year, is there like $1 level or percentage of sales so you can help us with so we can think about the cost benefits, and some of these costs coming back into Nordson? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. So, I guess, let me just give a little color commentary specifically on costs. Last year we had several actions that referenced incremental annualized cost savings, some of them were $10 million, one was $5 million. And some of those started at different points throughout 2020. And so those are hitting at the full, I would say, benefit run rate here in Q1. So that you see that that should be maintained going forward. I will tell you also on the cost side, we're benefiting on a year-over-year basis of about $6 million for lower T&E expense as Q1 last year did not have the pandemic cost structure of no travel. And so as that starts to come back, going forward there's a potential another $6 million I don't think at all come back right away. But as you think about it from this run rate, it's about 6 million on the T&E that we benefited in Q1. So -- and the other thing, I referenced is that Q1 typically is our heavy SG&A quarter. If you look last year and the prior year, for different employee benefit reasons. And so that trend should continue as we go forward throughout 2021. Walter Liptak : Okay. Okay, thanks for that color. And then may be just the last one for me about, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, the vaccine packaging. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that? Was there -- is there a revenue size or these orders that came in last year that shift is there more orders that will benefit or come through as sales in second quarter or second half? Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. This is a really strong growth driver for us and the one that we have been working on for a number of years, Walt. It's starting to show up in the marketplace right now. This is single use plastic components, which are used in the manufacture of biopharm, and in this particular case vaccines as well. And we saw some pretty strong growth in the quarter. We expect the growth to continue in the out quarters and maybe even further out. And the biggest reason we are able to have a sort of a flat medical revenue when compared to our customers being down 15% is mainly because of this biopharm growth driver. And so it is more of our single use plastic components that are used in critical biopharm manufacturing steps. Walter Liptak : Okay, got it. All right. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions. I will turn the call back to presenters for closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. We look forward to talking to you further during our Virtual Investor Day on March 30. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Lara Mahoney. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communication. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, May 25, 2021 to report Nordson's fiscal 2021 second quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our Web site at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor Web site, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Tuesday June 1. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today's agenda, on Slide 3, Naga will discuss second quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. Joe also will talk about the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will conclude with high-level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our updated fiscal 2021 full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to Slide 4, and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2021 second quarter conference call. Throughout fiscal 2020, we remained invested in what makes Nordson strong, our direct sales model and innovative position technology portfolio. We also advanced our new NBS Next growth framework, which ensures we focus our resources on the best opportunities for profitable growth. This strategy has positioned us well last year, and as the recovery continues to accelerate in 2021, it has put us in an excellent position to respond to our customers and deliver record sales, gross margin, operating profit and EBITDA during the fiscal 2021 second quarter. As the quarter progressed end market demand accelerated faster and to a greater degree than we originally anticipated, particularly in medical, electronics and industrial end markets. Nordson's dispense applications in the Industrial Precision Solutions segment benefited from the pickup in industrial end markets as well as the sustained demand for food and beverage packaging. In the Advanced Technology Solutions segment, a data centric economy where increasing demand for semiconductors and complex electronic devices drove the need for our test and inspection and fluid dispense products. We have also started to see recovery in our medical interventional solution product lines as the outpatient surgeries are beginning to increase following the COVID-19 related slowdown. Our medical businesses continues to benefit from accelerated growth of single use plastic fluid components for biopharmaceutical applications. I want to congratulate and thank the Nordson global team for achieving this record second quarter. I'm also proud of our team's dedication to meet this accelerating demand while maintaining COVID-19 safety protocols and effectively managing supply chain and capacity constraints. I'll speak more about the business in few moments. But first, I'll turn the call over to Joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joseph Kelley : Thank you Naga and good morning to everyone. On Slide #5, you see second quarter 2021 sales were $590 million, an increase of 11% over prior year's second quarter sales of $529 million. This double-digit growth is more than a bounce back. In fact, as Naga noted, this is a quarterly record for the company, breaking the previous record established in Q3 of 2017. The sales increase was primarily related to 10% organic volume growth, off of a relatively strong Q2 2020 performance. Favorable foreign currency and the net negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures. The benefits from the Fluortek and vivaMOS acquisitions were more than offset by the negative headwinds from the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line. When excluding the divested product line in the prior year for comparability purposes, sales growth would have been 15% in the current year second quarter. Robust growth in electronics and consumer non-durable end markets as well as strengthening medical and industrial end markets were the primary drivers of this performance. From a geographic perspective, growth was strong in all regions except Japan, which has been more heavily impacted by shutdowns related to the pandemic. Gross profit totaled $338 million or 57% of sales in the quarter compared to $290 million, or 55% of sales in the prior year. This 260 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by the combination of improved sales mix, volume leverage and benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020. The divested screws and barrels product line at the beginning of the fiscal second quarter was a significant contributor to the improved sales mix. It is noteworthy that a gross margin of 57% is a new quarterly company record. Also records in the quarter were operating profit of $166 million or 28% of sales, a 33% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $125 million and EBITDA of $192 million, or 33% of sales, which is 26% higher than the prior year EBITDA of $152 million. The incremental EBITDA margins were 65% in the quarter. Investors are starting to see the power of the NBS Next growth framework, as it drives double-digit organic sales volume growth, improved sales mix, enhances manufacturing efficiencies, resulting in strong profitable growth. Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense decreased $1 million or 17% from the prior year levels associated with reduced debt levels and a lower effective borrowing rate. Other net expense increased $3 million, largely driven by currency translation gains in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year. Tax expense totaled $32 million, or an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter. Net income in the quarter increased year-over-year 35% to $124 million or $2.12 per share, yet another quarterly company record. This significant growth is reflective of volume leverage driven by the 11% increase in sales as well as benefits from cost control measures and improved efficiencies. Now let's turn to Slide 6 and 7 to review the second quarter 2021 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $299 million increased 6% compared to the prior year second quarter. The organic volume increase of 8% was driven by strong demand and flexible packaging and industrial coating product lines. A strengthening euro and RMB also contributed to a 5% in currency benefit during the quarter. The divested screws and barrels product line was a negative 7% impact on the year-over-year sales growth. It's important to note that the segment sales are north of 2020 and 2019 levels when prior year balances are adjusted for the divested screw and barrel product line. Operating profit in the segment was $104 million, or 35% of sales compared to $77 million of adjusted operating profit in the prior year period. This 36% profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage associated with the 8% organic growth, favorable sales mix, improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower year-over-year SG&A, including reduced travel expense that we continue to experience through the second quarter. Moving now to Advanced Technology Solutions. Sales of $291 million increased approximately 18% compared to the prior year second quarter. This change included an organic increase of approximately 13% as well as increases of approximately 3% related to currency and 2% related to acquisitions. The increase in organic sales volume was driven by strong demand for test and inspection product lines serving electronics end markets and fluid management product lines serving medical and industrial end markets. Also, as we forecasted, on the first quarter call, we started to see the electronic dispense applications contribute to growth late in the quarter. Second quarter 2021 operating profit for this segment was $77 million, or 26% of sales. This increase of 30% over prior year operating margin of $59 million or 24% of sales was driven by sales volume leverage, favorable sales mix and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020. It is encouraging to see the benefits of NBS Next driving the top line organic growth and delivering strong incremental profit margins in both of our operating segments. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Page 8. We again end the quarter with a very strong balance sheet and sufficient available borrowing capacity. Cash totaled $133 million and net debt was $734 million, ending the quarter with a 1.2x leverage ratio based on trailing 12 months EBITDA. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $94 million, which was 4% above the prior year free cash flow. Cash conversion and net income was 75% in the quarter, which was below normal levels due primarily to a $50 million discretionary pension contribution. Improvements in working capital efficiency contributed favorably to our free cash flow in the quarter. The year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate remains north of 100%. I will now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Joe. Let's turn to Slide 9. Again, thank you to the Nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance in the quarter. We hosted an Investor Day on March 30 to detail our long-term plans for making a strong Nordson even stronger. If you did not have a chance to participate in our Investor Day, the replay of the event is available on our Web site. Now, I'd like to summarize a few highlights. First and foremost, we describe the strong growth drivers enabling Nordson's future profitable growth performance, including diverse end markets, new applications and emerging markets. While our growth drivers are unique to each of our divisions, the diversity of our end markets and the high-level of recurring revenue made us resilient through fiscal 2020 and our strengthening in fiscal 2021 results. At our Investor Day, we also reiterated our commitment to innovation, one of Norton's key competitive advantages. Our customer intimate model gives us insight to the needs of our customers, and we develop our product roadmap as an enabler of their new technologies. In the presentation, we highlighted two of our newest products, the ProBlue Flex melter for packaging customers, and the new Vantage integrated dispense and automation system, which is the first fully integrated wafer handling system designed for the semiconductor industry. In both cases, these new products are advancing automation, reducing cost and accelerating productivity. Both products contributed to record sales in the quarter. To make a strong Nordson even stronger, we also spoke to the new competencies that we are building, notably the NBS Next growth framework. This data driven framework is driving our decision making. We are already starting to see the benefits of our deployment of NBS Next. Last year, we announced structural cost reductions that were based on our strategic discipline analysis. It also drove our decision to divest the screws and barrels product line at the beginning of the second quarter. Simultaneously, we approved new investments in our top opportunities, such as funding new equipment for our Loveland Colorado facility to grow our biopharmaceutical components, and building a new facility in Mexico to support the needs of our Nordson medical interventional solution products. These decisions are strengthening both our top and bottom line. Since being vaccinated, I have started to travel to our businesses. It is exciting to see the engagement of our teams deploying NBS Next to make data driven decisions on how to delight our best customers or invest in the most innovative technology projects or prioritize top products in manufacturing operations. Turning to Slide 10, NBS Next is a critical pillar of our new Ascend Strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. In addition to NBS Next, the other interconnected pillars of the Ascend Strategy are; Owner Mindset, Nordson's entrepreneurial division-led organization and Winning Teams, Nordson's talent strategy. It is also exciting to experience the progress we are making in each of these pillars. We now have all of our division leaders in place, and they are focused on building a deep and diverse bench of talent who will support our long-term growth. The successful execution of the Ascend Strategy will help us achieve our long-term growth milestones of $3 billion in revenue and 30% EBITDA. This target will be achieved through a combination of organic growth within each segment as well as the acceleration of acquisitions. Clearly, the record second quarter, an updated fiscal 2021 outlook demonstrate that we are off to a strong start towards achieving our long-term goals. Now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2021 outlook on Slide 11. As we enter the fiscal third quarter, backlog is strong and trailing 12-week order entry is up double digits about prior year levels across the majority of our product lines and geographic regions. For full year fiscal 2021, we expect sales growth to be approximately 8% to 10% over fiscal year 2020. Excluding the 3% headwind from the revenue of the divested screws and barrels product line in the prior year, our forecasted full year sales growth would be approximately 11% to 13%. Our forecasted sales growth combined with strategic actions taken around efficiency and cost is forecasted to deliver earnings in the range of $7.20 to $7.50 per diluted share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects 34% earnings growth compared to prior year and a 25% increase over 2019 earnings. Our current financial results signify more than the benefits of the recovery. Nordson wins because of the foundation of our precision technology focus, customer centric model and diversified end markets. We are well-positioned to benefit from the recovery, and our products remain a critical solution to our customers through the cycle ahead. Additionally, our management team is fully engaged in advancing the implementation of the Ascend Strategy, which will establish a growth framework entrepreneurial organization and a deep diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth. As always, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions.

With that, I'll turn to Slide 4, and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2021 third quarter conference call. First and foremost, I want to congratulate the Nordson team on another record quarter. During this quarter we continued to benefit from the execution of our NBS Next growth framework in combination with robust end market demand. Investments in industrial context and the strengthening medical and electronics end markets grow record results in the quarter. I'm also pleased with the resilience of our colleagues. In this dynamic macro environment that continues to be plagued by supply chain, labor, and COVID concerns, our division leaders are deploying NBS Next to focus resources on the greatest growth opportunities in their respective businesses. I'll speak more about the business including the recent announcement of the NDC Technologies acquisitions in a few moments but first I'll turn the call over to Joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joe? Joseph P. Kelley: Thank you Naga and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 5 you'll see third quarter 2021 sales were $647 million, an increase of 20% over prior year\u2019s third quarter sales of $538 million. This is a new quarterly record for the company, $57 million above the prior quarterly record. The increase was primarily related to 20% organic volume growth and favorable currency offset by net negative impact from acquisitions and divestitures. The benefits from the Fluortek and vivaMOS acquisitions were more than offset by the headwind from the divestiture of the Screw and Barrel product line. When excluding the divested product line in the prior year for comparability purposes, sales growth would have been 24% in the current year third quarter. The organic sales increase was driven by continued demand across all divisions and end markets including a seasonal increase in quarterly shipments into the electronics end markets. From a geographic perspective, growth was once again strong in all regions except Japan which continues to manage pandemic related impacts.  Gross profit totaled $365 million or 56% of sales in the quarter compared to $281 million or 52% of sales in the prior year. This 430 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by volume leverage, benefits from structural cost reduction measures taken in fiscal 2020, and improved sales mix particularly resulting from the divested Screw and Barrel product line at the beginning of fiscal second quarter. Also record in the quarter were operating profit of $188 million or 29% of sales, a 57% increase from the prior year adjusted operating profit of $120 million and EBITDA of $215 million or 33% of sales. This result was 45% higher than the prior year EBITDA of $148 million. Our broad-based organic growth plus the favorable sales mix benefits including the divestiture has led to attractive incremental EBITDA margins of greater than 60% in the quarter. The application of the NBS Next growth framework at our divisions is helping us to focus and realize profitable growth in areas of greatest opportunity. Looking now at non-operating expense. Net interest expense decreased $1 million or 18% from the prior year associated with reduced debt levels. Other net expense decreased $7 million driven primarily by smaller currency translation losses and a non-cash pension settlement charge of $3 million in the third quarter of 2020 associated with retirement of the prior CEO that did not repeat. Tax expense totaled $38 million or an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter. Net income in the quarter increased to 71% year-over-year to $142 million or $2.42 per share, yet another quarterly company record. This significant growth is reflective of volume leverage driven by the 20% increase in sales as well as benefits from cost control measures and improved sales mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and 7 to review the third quarter 2021 segment performance. Industrial precision solution sales of $345 million increased 20% compared to the prior year third quarter. The organic volume increase of 22% was driven by the same growth in hot melt adhesive dispensing and industrial coating product lines. System sales in the quarter were particularly strong up 37% across the broad set of end markets and geographies. The divested Screws and Barrels product line more than offset the currency gains on a year-over-year sales growth. Operating profit in the segment was $124 million or 36% of sales compared to $78 million of adjusted operating profit in the prior year period. This 60% profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage associated with the organic growth, favorable sales mix, and improved manufacturing efficiencies. The NBS Next growth framework is driving strong sales growth at very attractive incremental operating profit margins. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, incremental operating profit margins were 55% in the quarter.  Moving now to Advanced Technology Solutions. Sales of $301 million increased approximately 21% compared to the prior year third quarter. This change included on organic increase of 18% as well as increases of 2% related to currency and 1% related to acquisitions. The increase in organic sales volumes was driven by strong double-digit growth in all product lines, particularly those serving electronics end markets and fluid management product lines serving medical and industrial end markets. Third quarter 2021 operating profit for this segment was $81 million or 27% of sales. This increase of 51% over prior year adjusted operating profit margin of $53 million was driven by sales volume leverage, favorable sales mix, and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020. Similar to the ITS segment the implementation of NBS Next throughout the divisions of ATS is driving strong sales growth at attractive incremental operating margins of greater than 50%.  Finally turning to cash flow and balance sheet on Slide 8. Free cash flow in the quarter was strong at $118 million which was 45% above the prior year free cash flow. Cash conversion on net income was 83% in the quarter which was below normal levels due primarily to investments in working capital to support growth and a $30 million pension contribution. The year-to-date free cash flow conversion rate remains north of 100%. Dividend payments were $23 million in the quarter and the company's Board approved a 31% increase in the annual dividend effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. This marks the 58th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. The significant increase of 31% reflects the strength of our financial results which is driven by our continued progress in executing the offense strategy combined with the desire to maintain targeted pay out in yield ratios. The annual dividend yield remains just under 1% at current market prices.  Our third quarter balance sheet includes cash of $174 million and net debt was 647 million ending the quarter with a 0.9 times leverage ratio based on trailing 12-months EBITDA. We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, similar to the NDC acquisition announced last week. I'll now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you Joe. Let's turn to Slide 9. Again, thank you to the Nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance. We are making progress on our Ascend Strategy to achieve top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. During the quarter Joe and I continued to visit our divisions to review their progress with NBS Next deployment. It is exciting to see how NBS Next is being applied to make data driven decisions to meet the increased demand of our customers. For example, in our Nordson Medical Interventional Solutions facility in Salem, New Hampshire, the team has used NBS Next to understand complexity and standardize their product offering. This has allowed them to disproportionately focus resources for their best customers and products. We are purposeful in where we focus our energy, to ensure we take advantage of the greatest opportunities for profitable growth even during the recovery.  NBS Next is at the core of our Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver the $3 billion in revenue and 30% EBITDA. This target will be achieved through a combination of organic growth within each segment as well as the acceleration of acquisitions. Clearly the record setting second quarter followed by the record setting third quarter demonstrates that we are off to a strong organic start towards achieving our long-term goals. We are also making progress on our acquisition objectives. On August 23rd we signed a definitive agreement to acquire NDC Technologies, a leading global provider of precision measurement solutions for in line process control. This acquisition expands our test and inspection platform into new markets and adjacent technologies.  With Nordson like gross margins it is clear that NDC has a differentiated product portfolio that is leveraged through a customer centric business model. This portfolio includes inline measurement sensors, gauges, and analyzers using near infrared, laser, XRAY, optical, and nucleonic technologies as well as proprietary algorithms and software. For example, it's near infrared technologies can simultaneously measure moisture, oil, and surface brownness of a potato chip or it can estimate the porosity level in the film used to separate the anode and cathode in an electric vehicle battery. It's laser and ultrasonic capabilities are used to measure wall thickness, ovality, and diameter of industrial cables or medical cubic.  As customers focus on automation and process control, NDC supports their success through these critical quality control technologies. We also look forward to leveraging NDC's software and algorithm expertise to advance Nordson\u2019s capabilities in manufacturing process intelligence development. I'm very pleased with the strategic fit of this business which aligns with the acquisition portion of the Ascend strategy presented at our Investor Day earlier this year. We look forward to welcoming the NDC team to Nordson, -- our NBS Next growth framework, and investing in NDC's greatest opportunities for profitable growth. We expect the deal to close within our fiscal first quarter of 2022.  Now let's turn to our updated fiscal 2021 outlook on Slide 10. As we enter the fiscal fourth quarter, backlog is approximately 700 million and 70% above the prior year. Customer order patterns have clearly changed in terms of both volume and extended shipment request dates in this dynamic environment. Based on the continued strength in our order entry and elevated backlog, we are increasing our full year revenue and earnings guidance. For full year fiscal 2021 we expect sales growth to be approximately 11% to 12% fiscal year 2020. Excluding the 3% headwind from the revenue of the divested Screws and Barrels product line in the prior year, our forecasted full year sales growth would be approximately 14% to 15%. Our forecasted sales growth combined with the benefits from the strategic actions taken around efficiency and cost is forecasted to deliver earnings in the range of $7.75 to $7.95 per diluted share. The midpoint of this guidance reflects 43% earnings growth compared to prior year and a 34% increase over 2019 earnings.  Given the strong system sales in the third quarter 2021 plus the seasonality in electronics, it is important that investors look at the second half of 2021 when reviewing our full year guidance. At the midpoint the guidance suggests second half sales growth of 14% and earnings growth of 47%. Additionally, the guidance implies that we expect to enter 2022 with a robust backlog approximately 70% greater than the backlog entering fiscal 2021. Our current financial results signified more than the benefits of the recovery. Nordson wins because of the foundation of our positioned technology focus, customer centric model, and diversified end markets. We are well positioned to benefit from this increase in demand as our products remain a critical solution to our customers through the cycle ahead. Additionally, our leadership team is advancing the implementation of the Ascend strategy which is establishing a growth framework, entrepreneurial organization, and a deep diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth.  As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders, and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that we will pause and take your questions. Operator : . Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : Thanks, a couple of questions. Typically, how much of your backlog would converge in the current quarter, I guess, excuse me, I am trying to get a sense in terms of how elongated maybe some of these orders have become? Joseph P. Kelley: Yeah so, Matt this is Joe. Let me just take that. Typically, I would tell you entering backlog we have less than 100% of quarterly sales entering any given quarter. And so it'll trend, I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just say in the 80% range of the quarterly -- upcoming quarterly sales and we clearly see that changing as the customer requested delivery date is out further and further. So customers are just placing orders further in advance. And so if you look at our quarterly sales going forward and our implied guidance, it would suggest that the midpoint is about 600 million and our backlog entering the year is about -- entering the quarter is about 700 million. So it has elongated. It depends on the systems businesses versus parts and different for each business but some of them are going out into Q2 of 2022. Matt Summerville : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then have you guys encountered any actual shipment delays for customers and in your mind are things getting better or worse stabilizing as we think about supply chain challenges, freight issues, etc.? Sundaram Nagarajan : Matt, this is Naga. Let me take that one. Yes, we are experiencing some but not significant. Freight especially, our international shipments sometimes seems to get pushed out but what we have experienced in the third quarter really is customers pulling orders forward. And what is impressive is you can see team even in a very difficult environment being able to manage its shipments as customers requested. Matt Summerville : And again Naga, just put a finer point on my question. Did you get the sense of things in this regard are getting more challenging, has the situation stabilized, are things starting to loosen up and get better yet, thank you? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, Matt I would say, it is a dynamic environment, it is not getting any worse but it's not getting any better either. But I will tell you that the Nordson team is fully participating in this recovery under some challenging environments but doing an excellent job. Matt Summerville : Excellent, thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line up Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Naga, I just want to explore the order trends a little bit more for you guys. I guess when you talk to your customers, is it more on the IPS or is it advanced technology, is it really just a reflection of some of those, I think with Matt talking about the supply chain challenges that people are trying to get those orders in a little earlier to guarantee delivery, just any thoughts is this sort of a temporary situation or do you think this -- your customer patterns or order patterns are starting to shift a little bit permanently? Sundaram Nagarajan : I would say what you're seeing is broad based strong order patterns across end markets, across regions. And are there some cases where people are trying to get in front of the line or ahead of the line, proactively yes. But quite frankly, if you think about the kind of end markets we play in and look at all the secular drivers for them, I'd tell you we are very pleased with the momentum that we are seeing. For example, in our medical business if you think about our fluid component business with biopharma, just not vaccine, but biopharma in general, we see some pretty strong order rates that is embedded and it is leading the secular growth drivers and biopharma really going well for us. And if you think about interventional solutions in the medical side, what you will find there is our aging population single use components, all of those drivers still intact. Selective surgeries or some might have unfortunately have started calling it as elective surgeries have come back, but that remains little bit fluid, but we feel really good about the recovery we are seeing in our medical businesses. On our electronic businesses, we are at a beginning of a really nice growth cycle here. You hear about ship shortages and you can -- all of those read their headlines around the big investments that major semiconductor manufacturers are making and Nordson is participating nicely in it. We've got a couple of new products that are entering the market both on testing inspection and our dispense business. So, industrial CAPEX is pretty robust. Might you say that might moderate over time, I would say yes, that might do that. On the packaging side, under consumer nondurables, really very strong move towards eating at home rather than out at a restaurant. Might that continue, we're seeing a lot of activity in packaged goods, packaged beverages. Our teams are starting to call them from keg to can and we have more people using cans. So we see a lot of containment businesses that are going well for us. Hopefully this is enough color Allison. Allison Poliniak : No, that's really helpful. And then I just want to touch on operating execution, incredibly strong in the past two quarters here. Relative to your expectations of setting some of these operational plans into place, is this -- if the execution may be better than maybe you would have anticipated kind of walking into this upcycle, any color on how that is relative to what your view was in terms of what the organization could do? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. No, I'm incredibly proud of the execution of the team. This is not ordinary times or environment that we're operating in. But we are using NBS Next in our businesses to meet this incredible demand and it plays out in many different ways in multiple businesses across the company. NBS Next fundamentally is all about making choices to drive growth. And what you begin to see is for example, in some of our businesses understanding what are your greatest growth opportunities and disproportionately investing in them is one way it shows up in this great execution. You see our team standardizing product offering, reducing complexity, streamlining and dedicating products to the most important products in the business, prioritizing our best growth opportunities, our best customers. So lots of different ways, be it quality, be it manufacturing capacity, be it conversion cost, be it selecting the right end markets to choose to play, and also treating very differently unattractive opportunities in the business is really how this is playing out. I am really happy about the progress we are making and I wouldn't say I'm surprised, but I am excited about the fact that the teams are doing one heck of a job, really converting orders to shipments, shipments to profitable growth for all of us. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Connor Lynagh : Yes, thanks. I was wondering if you could touch on the NDC acquisition and basically I am just wondering if you could sort of eliminate obviously you guys are very focused on growth, how is the growth profile of this business looked over the past few years, where do you see the opportunities, is it this business enhancing your growth in your existing portfolio, your portfolio of existing growth in this business, how do you think about that? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, in this business historically, they have underperformed in terms of growth versus where they should really be growing because we play in the same end markets as these businesses. So we fundamentally see an application of NBS Next in this to understand what are the best growth opportunities for them and invest this disproportionately in those two dry clothes. This would most likely be I would say mid-single-digits is sort of our growth expectation for this business and we feel really good about it. Their performance in the year is looking really good. Suddenly we don\u2019t talk about specific product lines and how they perform but we feel really good about it. But what I would tell you about this business that we really like, it is strategically similar to lot of notes in businesses. It has got a customer centric business model. I would direct sales model, global sales and service support, large installed base, lot of similarities to some of our consumer non-durable businesses. It has a very strong suite of differentiated products and you see that in Nordson like gross margins. So we're looking forward to welcoming this team, using NBS Next, understanding the growth initiatives, and really for us this is a pretty strong place to be. You know, we do clearly see a patch for the margins to expand north of 20% EBITDA. Connor Lynagh : Got it, helpful context. I am wondering if you could just characterize the broader M&A landscape out there. You know with this they are diamond in the rough was this one of many good options we saw out there. Just an update on sort of the opportunity set and the valuations will be great? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. M&A we clearly remained focused. As everybody would tell you, M&A landscape has improved, banker activity certainly have expanded and accelerated this year when compared to last year. We remain focused though. We are very focused around continuing to scale up our medical businesses. We see a lot of opportunities there. We will continue to stay focused there. Test and inspection as NDC will illustrate for you is an area we continue to diversify, getting into new markets, getting to new technologies. Our dress  inspection kind of today is very electronic centered. With NDC you can begin to see us move beyond electronics and that\u2019s really what you would see. So we see opportunities there. And finally, we have an internal team that continues to explore opportunities on precision technologies that are very adjacent to what we do today. Just as a reminder, we are laser focused on strategic criteria to play in attractive end markets that have real good growth profile to them. Precision technology suite of products and have a customer centric business model.  On the financial side, clearly, we are looking for assets that can add to our organic growth ambitions. We would Nordson like gross margins, that's really critical for us. For us gross margin equals differentiation is the way to think about it. That's how we think about it within the company. And on EBITDA our expectations as we said in our Investor Day, approximately 20%. Would we do deals below that, yes and would we do deals above that, but we're looking for clear margin expansion opportunities and all this results in a fairly decent otherwise greater than our cost of capital over three to five years. Connor Lynagh : Got it. Thank very much the color. I will hand it back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Hammond : So just back on margins, I think there was an earlier question on that, but just I think the expectation was 3Q would step down from 2Q and we've gone the other way and I think 4Q guide suggests a step down. I guess what's surprising you the most or maybe where's is the caution in the guide on the margin, is it largely mix or do we start to see some of the inflationary pressures come through, maybe just a little color there? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. Maybe if I could, on the gross margin in Q2 we did 57% and when you think about our gross margin, we used to operate in the range, I would say between 53% and 55%. Given the divestiture of the Screw and Barrel product line, that has systematically I would tell you moved our gross margin and top margin profile up probably 175 basis points. And so now I think the new normal from a gross margin standpoint works in the range of 55% to 57% and you see that was sustainable to Q2 and in Q3. When you think about the sequential Q3 to Q4 and you look at our guidance and more specifically, I guess if you look at the second half of 2021 Jeff, forecasted performance, you need to understand that approximately $25 million worth of system orders were pulled forward from our scheduled Q4 shipments into Q3 based on customer request. This was primarily in the industrial end market and primarily NIPS. Therefore, the guidance range implies Q4 performance would actually be comparable to Q3 if you adjust both quarters for the $25 million sales pull forward. Again, this was -- full forward was request of the customer and as Naga mentioned, proud of our teams despite some of the supply chain issues, ability to meet the customer's request and demand and pull that forward.  It is also of noteworthy, I guess if you exclude that $25 million from Q3, it would still have been a record breaking quarter, $30 million North of the prior quarterly record. The sequential swing, we tried to point this out to investors by talking to the second half performance that the 14% growth in revenue and 47% growth in earnings at the midpoint. I would tell you the other noteworthy point when you look Q3 to Q4 and you look at the year-over-year growth rates is the 4%tailwind that we had in Q3, that starts to moderate when you look at the year-over-year growth rate in Q4 to about 1% and again that's just given the movement and exchange rates last year, Q3 to Q4. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, that's all very helpful. Thanks Joe. Just back on medical, I think Naga you called out biopharma is particularly strong. And your comments, just I wanted to dig in more on the kind of the elective surgery, pace of recovery, and is that trending in line or better than you had expected? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Jeff, thank you. On elective surgeries, in the third quarter we did really well and it was trending nicely. Now without a variant, might you expect that to take back down, that is possible. But I fully expect that what had happened last year as we talked all of last year, as -- our surgeries, like our teams would describe a more selective not elective, right. If you need to get a heart valve replacement you have to get a heart valve replacement, it is just a matter of time. So you could get it postponed, but you couldn\u2019t get it cancelled, right. I guess, it's something when that happens then that could happen, but that's not what you're hoping for. So what we do see and what we experienced in the third quarter is a nice recovery. We saw that business really get back to high single digits in the quarter, and that was really nice to see. Going into fourth quarter, we're trying to be cautious here but we don't see it grow all the way back like last year. I do think it will be little bit lower, but we fully expect medical to recover completely because all of the growth factors that we play towards are on aging population, all of this is going to be intact for us, and it is a great business that is already returning to normal. Will there be bumps in the road, yes absolutely. Given the delta variant, you could have few bumps in the road. Hopefully, that gives you -- answers your question. Jeffrey Hammond : No, that's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : . Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Just a quick clarification on that last question, Jeff asked. So is it fair to say that you haven't seen a full recovery in the medical PC  yet. Trajectory is good to get some volatility that happens over the next couple of quarters depending on how the broader delta bearing goes and other factors. But on a trailing basis, you don't think that we've gotten that full recovery yet, is that fair? Sundaram Nagarajan : Fair. Michael Halloran : And so then two questions. First, when you look at the order patterns and how those have elongated and shifted, have you seen any change in the seasonality that you're expecting on the actual conversion of those orders, in other words, as the demand carries through, are you still thinking that on an all in basis, the seasonality is about the same or you think the seasonality has shifted some? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. I would tell you seasonality is evolving. When you think about our end market exposure and our particular applications, I don't -- we have studied the numbers on the quarter, I don't know what is the normal seasonality anymore. I mean, if you take, for example, our customers behavior on the industrial side pulling in shipments into Q3 when typically, Q4 was our strongest quarter and look at our implied guidance that suggest that Q4 is going to be down through Q3 because of that. So, I don't know that given our electronics exposure has changed in terms of applications with the semiconductor cycle, our medical business, the biopharma has been strong as the elective surgeries come back and the interventional side starts to return to growth. Our normal seasonality as I would say really challenged to make that statement anymore. Michael Halloran : So, the answer is what seems like no, but when you look at the orders that you're getting in, what's the risk that there's been some double ordering or those cancelability in that order book versus it is just a business with a different cadence and the underlying demand, underlying order cadence so that declines can reserve spots over the next couple of quarters? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes, I would tell you we track order cancellation very closely and we do not see an uptick in that whatsoever. So, I think we monitor that risk, but to date that risk is very low. Michael Halloran : You know -- go ahead. Sundaram Nagarajan : Sorry Mike, go ahead, finish up and then\u2026 Michael Halloran : No, no, no I wanted to say thank you, but I didn't know there's something else, so please Naga go ahead. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think what I would add is just look at the unprecedented investments that are going on in industrial CAPEX, that is one that I would really point to as one of the big drivers in what you've seen in our IPS business. What you would also see in our electronics APS business is this real strong, semi-investments and a particularly strong consumer electronic demand for what is turning out to be a digital economy. So, the macro drivers are pretty strong that we feel really good about what we are seeing in terms of demand for some of our precision technologies. Michael Halloran : So is the implication then there that yes, the order book has been very good and you like the fact that you're getting more visibility but it seems like you're also implying that the front line of opportunity still remains pretty robust? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Yes. Michael Halloran : Okay, good. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : Just wondering, Naga, if you had anything to call out in terms of notable changes in the competitive backdrop consistent with the or with coincident with the pandemic, if anyone's kind of fallen off or gotten flat footed, clearly, it seems like you've picked up some momentum that you generated, but just wondering about the kind of broader question as well? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, we generally tone down -- we have some really strong competitors, but you know the business of course have followed us for a long period of time. In our consumer non-durable businesses, we really are very -- in a little bit significant position with being a global competitor, right. So, a lot of our businesses what you see us being is this global competitor that can be relied upon for good times and bad times and can be relied upon for global support for customers applications and service and sales, right. And so what we've seen come through in this environment is that value proposition getting strengthened even further as others will have some hiccups here or there, are not able to make commitments, Nordson team is there supporting our customers and really in a lot of ways strengthens our value proposition and reaffirms for the customer why you want to work with Nordson, not only because you're going to get precision technologies, you're going to get reliable support that is going to be global in nature. And then that's -- if anything it just reaffirms our strong value proposition. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. And then the backlog got 70%, should we think about that as both segments kind of participating in parallel more or less? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. We don't give backlog guidance on a segment specific basis, but you can interpret our performance year-to-date has been quite broad based. I mean, you see both segments growing approximately 20% organically in the quarter and broad based in terms of geography and end markets and division. So we're not going to start giving backlog in segments. Christopher Glynn : Yeah, that wasn't what I asked. I appreciate the answer. Last one from me, I'm just curious about the industrial trends in particular, has that been accelerating sequentially during and through past quarter, and in particular, are there any types of applications that you're seeing really breakout in industrial? Sundaram Nagarajan : Our industrial business, strong investments, a couple of areas I would point out for you. We have applied NBS Next in all of our businesses to really understand what are the best growth opportunities, where is it we want to focus on and how do we treat some positions that are in inherently unattractive. And so the net result of all of this is we find some real strong growth in container for example. So we talked about beverage cans and Nordson has a very strong position and a very attractive position technology suite that supplies people who make beverage cans. And you coat the inside of a beverage can and that's an example of what you see in this whole consumer shift on how they eat and consume beverages and food. So we are benefiting there. We're also beginning to see in our powder business this broad based industrial activity that is leading to investments on paint lines and things like that. So we're doing well there. Our packaging on the industrial, adhesive is doing an extremely well as well. So hopefully, that gives you a couple of different points. Some of this is certainly broad based but where we are pretty pleased with how the team is fully participating in the recovery that is going on. Christopher Glynn : Great, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : I want to talk a little bit about mix in the quarter. So obviously, NBS Next is helping and in industrial position you're seeing the divestiture is helping both. Are you seeing any interesting trends that are helping mix that standpoint? And then same with ATS, I would think that actually with electronics and test infection improving you would see maybe a less favorable mix, but what's going out in there? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. So within the segments, I think, particularly let's just take one segment at a time, ATS we do see some favorable mix. And I really think it's not to your point at the division level, but it is almost within the division. So, if you think about NBS Next it is being implemented at the division level, so even the relatively low margin businesses and divisions within that are seeing nice improvement in their profitability, in their gross margin, which is driving the favorable mix within the divisions. So it's funny that at ATS within -- at the division level, the mix is actually unfavorable, but it was favorable within each of the divisions such that the end result was most favorable for the segment. And so, I think that -- NBS Next being applied within the division where you're looking at specific applications. I mean, not to mention, within IPS some of the liquid coating opportunities is clearly a favorable mix expansion. Within IPS, you see a very similar story and particularly, I mean, you had strong growth in the systems over the parts within IPS, but yet the margins improved beyond that of the mix benefit that we got from the divestiture of Screw and Barrel business. But if you look at the IPS business, that divestiture alone is probably worth 350 basis points of margin expansion but they're expanding beyond that due to the favorable mix, I would tell you within the divisions. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Sundaram Nagarajan : Another point I guess, which is also helping is we've had some nice success both in IPS and in ATS with our new product launches. The Pro Blue flex and Advantage continued to gain traction. And I would tell you that is helping us from a top line perspective as well as the mix standpoint. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. That's helpful. And then another one on -- with the NDC acquisition, it seems like a great company. I guess I was a little bit surprised given like the specialty nature of the business and it seems like a pretty good deal that EBITDA margins look like they're around 16.5% to 17%. Is this a situation where this company has a very high gross margin profile but maybe EBITDA margins you see an opportunity to expand and I know you gave over 20% target, is that a near term target or is the longer-term to more get that margin in line or above corporate average? Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me first start and then Joe, if you could add a little bit more color that would be good. The reason we acquired NDC Technologies is because it fits right with our test and inspection business. And particularly that particular company we really like is because if you look at its gross margins, they are Nordson like gross margins. They have a customer centric business model that is like Nordson. So, it's this case of strong gross margins, indicating a strong differentiated product portfolio, but EBITDA margins are slightly lower than our target. Joe, if you want to just add a little bit more color on what we are thinking near term? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. So, you are correct, the margin is coming in about 16% to 17% EBITDA margins and we see opportunities under our ownership and the execution of NBS Next to get margin expansion over the next I would say, couple of years similar to what you see on the core Nordson business as we roll out NBS Next. Sundaram Nagarajan : But the main opportunity here is to use NBS Next to identify the best growth opportunities, to invest in them disproportionately, and really grow the company and margin expansion will follow. Joseph P. Kelley: So with the 55% growth as favorable incremental margin, so it's the growth that drives the margin expansion. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak of Seaport. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning everybody. And great quarter. I'd like to go back to the 25 million of IPS Systems that got pulled forward. I guess it's impressive with supply chain that you were able to get that into the quarter. But I guess my question is about the fourth quarter, I think you said Joe that the system -- IPS Systems would be down sequentially, is that right? And then what is it due to the operating leverage, was it due to the margins if you've got more mix of aftermarket parts in IPS in the fourth quarter? Joseph P. Kelley: Yes. So, just my comment it was holistically there was about 25 million both from Q4 into Q3 predominantly systems and predominantly, I would say, IPS. And so to Naga\u2019s point and your point, it was impressive our team being able to meet that customer request, those customer requests. But from a margin standpoint, you build these systems over time. It shouldn't have huge -- our incremental\u2019s are what they are and we're still going to deliver growth in Q4 if you take the midpoint of our guidance. And the sequential comment really Walt it is just Q3 to Q4 for Nordson when you level out and adjust that 25 million and take it out of Q3 into Q4. But Q4 on an adjusted basis, we would be relatively flat. And so it's just that swing in the systems, which is driving the sequential drop. Walter Liptak : Okay. And how are you thinking about the fourth quarter margins, are you saying that there's going to be less leverage because the volume growth won't be as high or is there a pickup in margin because there'll be more aftermarket because I can\u2019t really think of systems and say in a little bit lower margin, maybe that's incorrect? Joseph P. Kelley: Yeah, that is changing it a little bit, but not to the degree, I think it was historically. And so, I would tell you we're thinking about margins for Q4 at the gross margin line to be comparable with our new run rate that we saw in Q2 of 57%, 56.5% here in Q3. So, we feel confident to operate in the 55% to 57% gross margin range as the level of call it 600 million to 650 million in sales. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Okay. Thanks. And then I wondered you guys talked about this last quarter a little bit, but it sounds like the supply chain there's a little bit challenges, but I wonder on pricing, are you seeing some inflationary pricing that you are passing along to customers, how are you doing that or is it on the project by project basis or are you taking up prices? Joseph P. Kelley: Yeah. It's really project by project. I would tell you division by division. We are experiencing as Naga touched on some supply chain challenges, some logistics challenges, but we are laser focused on managing the gross margins of this business. And we're also I would tell you looking out over the long-term as it relates to our customer relationships and in our position I think that bodes well for us. When we entered this pandemic in terms of strengthening what's important to Nordson is that intimate customer direct sales model. And as we work through these challenging times remaining focused on the gross margin and capturing the value we provide but also protecting the long-term relationship with our customer. So, that's how we I would tell you look at that pricing. Sundaram Nagarajan : Walt, one thing I would add to it is given our gross margins, the material cost in our business is fairly small when compared to other companies. We had a value added assembler of components. We don't have big process component to our business. So, to the extent that we need to increase prices in certain areas, we have done that, we will continue to do that. But in general this is not a huge, significant, material issue for us. Walter Liptak : Yes, agree. There's no doubt about that. Okay and then one maybe last for me is Naga you mentioned that you and Joe have been out traveling, visiting the facilities, yes. And I wonder if you finish that process, how are you feeling now about like the delta variant where you continue to visit operations and moving the delta variants can have any impact going into the end of the year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. From our travel perspective, we continue to remain safe but we can\u2019t continue to just stay in the bunkers, right. So Joe and I are being very cautious on how we travel, where we travel, but we are going to continue to travel in a very limited basis. If this thing didn\u2019t exist, would we be in more businesses than we are today, absolutely yes. But, so trying to find the right balance in terms of being safe as well as building in the businesses with our team, which is really where all of the action is going on. Walter Liptak : Okay, Great. And are your sales people I guess are getting out too and visiting with customers. Do you expect that will continue through the end of the year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. It is by request of the customers and it is in region? We're not -- we do have some thoughts around trying to balance safety as well as trying to help our customers meet their business needs. So it is still decided by senior leaders in the company who travels, where we travel. We have started going to some shows on a very limited basis. So the dynamic environment is doing an excellent job of taking prudent mentions to be safe yet make sure we're are taking care of customers. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Okay, thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. I want to reiterate that Nordson is well positioned to benefit from the accelerating recovery and our precision technologies remain a critical solution to our customers through this cycle. Additionally, our leadership team is advancing the implementation of the Ascend strategy, which is establishing a growth framework, entrepreneurial organization, and a deep and diverse team to drive sustainable profitable growth. Thank you for your time and attention today. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s call conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Nordson Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Conference Call.  Thank you. Lara Mahoney, you may begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I am here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, December 16, 2021, to report Nordson\u2019s fiscal year 2021 fourth quarter and full year results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today\u2019s call on our website at nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until December 30, 2021. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call maybe forward-looking based upon Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today\u2019s agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss fourth quarter and full year highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. Joe also will talk about the year end balance sheets and cash flow. Naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including an update on the Ascend strategy, as well as our fiscal 2022 first quarter and full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I will turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year conference call. On the heels of 2020, a year marked by the COVID pandemic, I don\u2019t think anyone knew what to expect coming into 2021. We were well positioned having both remained invested in our customer-centric businesses and started deployment of NBS Next growth framework. Our focus remained sharply on protecting the health and safety of our employees, while also meeting the needs of our customers. The successful deployment of NBS Next ensured we were able to fully participate in the accelerated economic recovery experienced in 2021. Our division leaders use strategic discipline to identify and then focus on the best opportunities for profitable growth in their respective businesses. As a result, we surpassed our prior record annual performance in sales by $108 million and an operating profit by $111 million. This new record was achieved through broad-based growth across most end markets and geographies. Fourth quarter was a solid finish to this record year. Sales were in line with our expectations, particularly in light of the timing of the approximate $25 million customer order that had been pulled forward into fiscal third quarter. Looking at the back half of fiscal 2021, we delivered 15% organic sales growth and 36% adjusted profit growth compared to the prior year second half. I will speak more about the businesses in few moments. But first, I will turn the call over to Joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joseph Kelley : Thank you, Naga and good morning to everyone. On Slide #5, you will see fourth quarter 2021 sales were $599 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year fourth quarter sales of $559 million. The increase was primarily related to 10% organic volume growth and favorable currency offset by headwinds from the screws and barrels product line divestiture. When excluding the divested product line in the prior year, for comparability purposes, sales growth would have been 11% in the current year fourth quarter. This double-digit organic sales increase was driven by solid growth in all product lines, with particularly strong demand in electronics, industrial and medical end markets. Test and inspection and consumer non-durable product lines delivered single-digit growth in the quarter, highlighting the continued stable demand in these markets. Geographically, all regions, except Japan, grew steadily. Gross profit totaled $331 million or 55% of sales in the quarter compared to $297 million or 53% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. This 200 basis point increase in gross margin was driven by improved sales mix from the divested screws and barrels product line, sales volume leverage and process enhancements from our NBS Next growth framework. On a sequential basis, we experienced some pressure on gross margin from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, primarily due to elevated freight costs stemming from this dynamic macroeconomic demand environment. Additionally, we incurred approximately $2 million in non-recurring cost as we aligned our medical fluid components business with its best growth opportunities. We believe these negative impacts on gross margins are largely temporary in nature and we are taking appropriate pricing actions in fiscal 2022 to offset inflationary pressures. Our differentiated product offering and market positions, organizational agility and disciplined approach to cost control, combined with consistent deployment of the Ascend strategy is allowing us to successfully navigate these challenges and continue to deliver profitable growth. Operating profit was $151 million in the quarter or 25% of sales, a 16% increase from the prior year. Double-digit organic growth, favorable sales mix and continued benefits from structural cost reduction actions taken in fiscal 2020, all contributed to incremental operating profit margins of 52% in the quarter. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $177 million or 30% of sales. Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense decreased $2 million or 31% from the prior year driven by reduced debt levels. Other net expenses increased $2 million primarily driven by currency translation losses. Tax expense in the quarter was $30 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, in line with the full year and forecasted rate. Net income in the quarter totaled $110 million or $1.88 per share representing a 19% increase from the prior year adjusted earnings. This improvement is reflective of the 7% year-over-year increase in sales, and more importantly, consistent application of the NBS Next growth framework, which leads to steady, profitable growth with attractive incremental margins. Turning to Slide #6, I will now share a few comments on our full year results. Sales for the fiscal year 2021 were a record $2.4 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. This change in sales included an increase in organic volume of 11% and favorable currency impact of 3%, offset by the net unfavorable acquisition and divestiture impact of 3%. Also company record\u2019s operating profit was $615 million and diluted earnings per share were $7.74, up 36% and 41% increase respectively from the prior year. EBITDA for the full year increased 27% to $719 million or 30% of sales. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and 8 to review the fourth quarter 2021 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $314 million increased 2% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Organic volume growth in the quarter was 8%, offset by an unfavorable divestiture impact of 7% and favorable currency of 1%. Robust demand for industrial coating products plus steady growth in the consumer non-durable end markets for hot melt adhesive dispensing products drove this quarter\u2019s results. From a regional perspective, growth was strongest in the U.S., the Americas and Europe. Operating profit for the quarter was $103 million or 33% of sales, which is an increase of 12% compared to the prior year adjusted operating profit of $92 million. This growth was driven by favorable sales mix and manufacturing efficiencies gained in part from the divestiture of the screws and barrels product line. I also want to remind investors that it was this segment, IPS that had strong third quarter organic growth of 22%, which included approximately $25 million of sales that were pulled forward from fourth quarter into third quarter per the customer\u2019s request. Therefore, this segment\u2019s second half 2021 organic sales growth of 15% and adjusted operating profit growth of 34% are more reflective of what this business is delivering. Advanced Technology Solutions sales of $285 million increased 14% compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. This change included an increase in organic sales volume of 13% and a 1% increase related to favorable currency impact. Growth was particularly strong in product lines serving electronics and medical end markets. Fluid dispense product lines serving industrial and automotive end markets also generated double-digit growth in the quarter. All geographies contributed to this quarter\u2019s growth, with particular strength in the international regions. Fourth quarter operating profit was $67 million or 24% of sales. The 29% year-over-year increase was driven by sales volume leverage and realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020. Deployment of our NBS Next growth framework continues to be a key element in the success of this segment, delivering profitable growth. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Page 9, through our disciplined approach to capital deployment, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and abundant borrowing capacity. Cash totaled $300 million partially in anticipation of the $180 million NDC technology acquisition, which we completed on November 1. Net debt was $516 million, resulting in a 0.7x leverage ratio based on the trailing 12-month EBITDA. Free cash flow in the quarter was $160 million, which brings the full year 2021 free cash flow total to $508 million or a conversion rate on net income of 112%. As a reminder, the 2021 full year free cash flow is inclusive of a net pension contribution, totaling greater than $90 million. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 2022, assume an effective tax rate of 21%, capital expenditures of approximately $40 million and pension contributions of approximately $10 million, well below the fiscal 2021 levels. In summary, our focus on disproportionately investing in the most profitable growth opportunities has led to another year of solid execution and record performance. While we continue to navigate the near-term challenges presented by this dynamic macroeconomic environment, we remain diligent in implementing the NBS Next growth framework and broader Ascend strategy. We are pleased with our focus and progress on these strategic initiatives and remain committed to delivering top-tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. I will now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Joe. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10. Again, I want to thank our team for managing safely through another year of COVID-19 as well as managing issues related to supply chain, labor and other macro concerns. With their dedication, passion and focus on making Nordson stronger, not only did we achieve record results for the full year, we also made great progress on our Ascend strategy. We first introduced Ascend at our Investor Day in March 2021, designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns the Ascend strategy encompasses three interconnected pillars : NBS Next, Nordson\u2019s growth framework; Owner Mindset, our entrepreneurial division-led organization, which empowers our divisions to make decisions as close to the customer as possible; and Winning Teams, Nordson\u2019s talent strategy. All three pillars are built on the foundation of what makes Nordson special, our culture and values. As we shared at our Investor Day, the successful execution of the Ascend strategy will deliver our financial targets of $3 billion in sales and 30% EBITDA by 2025. Through the cycle, we expect to achieve sales growth of 7% plus through an equal mix of organic and acquisitive growth. 2021 was a record year with double-digit organic growth and EBITDA margins ahead of our targets. We are just beginning to make progress on our acquisitive growth targets. On November 1, we completed the acquisition of NDC Technologies. This test and measurement business has a differentiated product portfolio that is leveraged through a customer-centric business model. It is a great fit with our strategic and financial criteria for M&A. The integration is off to a solid start. In November, the NDC leadership team received their initial training on NBS Next. They are leaning in and asking good questions about how to incorporate our growth framework into their business. It is proving to be a good cultural fit and I am very pleased with the level of engagement I am seeing at all levels of the NDC organization. M&A is a very important part of our growth strategy. We are looking forward to executing upon our pipeline as the right opportunities present themselves. We have a strong balance sheet, and are well positioned to do so. Over the past year, investors have asked if we will adjust our long-term financial targets following the strength of this year. We strongly believe that these continue to be the right targets, and we are pleased to have executed a very strong first year against them. Our divisions are focused every day on delivering profitable growth, and these long-term targets will not govern our potential to act on the best market opportunities. Before I address fiscal 2022 outlook, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight our new ESG report. As discussed in more detail in the report, our Ascend strategy and ESG priorities are closely integrated and depend on each other to refine and improve our overall performance. The underlying elements of ESG have been central to Nordson\u2019s culture and success throughout its 60-year plus history. Nordson is a light assembly manufacturer, and we are committed to identifying ways to minimize our own environmental footprint while helping our customers do the same. Throughout our long history of designing and developing precision dispensing technology, we have sought to reduce our customers\u2019 material cost and consumption by increasing yields and reducing scrap during their manufacturing processes. This has been a vital part of our success. We\u2019re also bringing solutions to the market that address environmentally conscious market opportunities such as advanced battery manufacturing to support renewable energy and manufacturing processes that utilize plant-based manufacturing materials. This report is a new foundation for our ESG strategy, influenced by leading ESG frameworks. It details our efforts to better understand our environmental footprint while also highlighting our progress on social and governance initiatives. We look forward to building upon this foundation in future reports. Now for the outlook on Slide 11, as we look to the full year, we are conscious of the dynamic environment with strong levels of demand, creating labor, material, logistic availability challenges, similar to what many of our peers are experiencing. Our entrepreneurial division-led organizational structure has enabled us to address these ever-changing dynamics head on. Our teams are agile in identifying solutions are on labor, material availability and transportation challenges to meet our customers\u2019 expectations. The strategic disciplined element of the NBS Next growth framework is undoubtedly helping the teams prioritize and deliver on the best growth opportunities within each division. We expect 2022 to be another record-breaking year with sales growth in the range of 6% to 10% and adjusted earnings growth in the range of 8% to 18% both as compared to fiscal 2021. We feel very confident going into the fiscal first quarter. As we first mentioned in the fiscal third quarter, we are still seeing extended shipment request dates in conjunction with large orders from our customers. This increased backlog, approximately 90% compared to the same period a year ago, and the trailing 12-week order entry was 25% above prior year levels. As a result of these evolving order patterns, traditional seasonality where the first quarter is much softer than the prior year fourth quarter is not applicable. First quarter 2022 should be comparable to the financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the year-over-year growth rate comparable to the second half 2021 growth rates. Based on anticipated sales timing, we expect the first quarter of 2022 sales growth to be approximately 14% to 16% as compared to the fiscal 2021 first quarter, with adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.80 to $1.95. As always, I want to thank our customers, employees and shareholders for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you.  Our first question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Mike Halloran : Thanks. Naga, can we pick up left off there. So you look at the guidance and obviously, first quarter growth rate is a little stronger than what you\u2019re assuming for the rest of the year. You certainly gave some context on why the seasonality would be different. But maybe talk about two things here. One, just how you\u2019re thinking about what is assumed-in guidance for how you think the rest of the year plays out by segment? And then my second question, and related, would just be how put this backlog in context? I mean it\u2019s significantly bigger than what we would have seen historically. How much of this should have shipped last year? How much of this is just pulled forward through the rest of the year and just try to give some context. So those are my two questions related. So I asked them at the same time? Sundaram Nagarajan : Okay. Great. Thanks, Mike. And what we want to talk a little bit about as we go into the year, we feel really good about first quarter just given the kind of environment that our customers are in and the order patterns we are seeing. So our first quarter is going to be more reflective of the back half of \u201821. And in terms of \u2013 if you think about the various end markets, let me start with the electronics. Electronics customer order entry patterns and demand levels are pretty strong. Medical, particularly biopharma and our interventional businesses, the order entry patterns are really strong. If you think about our industrial and consumer non-durable businesses, early part of the year, we feel really good about it based on the backlog we have. But as we look into the back half of the year, we do see those two end markets returning or normalizing to historic levels that we shared at our Investor Day. So that\u2019s \u2013 hopefully, that answers the first part of your question, which is \u2013 feel really good about the full year guidance, which is going to be at the midpoint, 8% growth on a record year, and that is really underpinning the strong demand patterns in medical electronics and back half, expecting some tapering off in industrial and consumer non-durable. In terms of the backlog, these are historical highs, as you indicated, we do believe these backlog is really forward-dated or extended lead times that we normally don\u2019t have in our businesses. So our customers are asking us or giving us orders or shipments, almost into the second quarter of next year, right, which is normally not the case. Normally, our demand patterns are such that people will ask us if the quarter out, right? And now people are putting their orders to be in line. And there is some amount of back and forth where customers are asking for some things to be shipped out ahead. So that\u2019s why some things get pushed \u2013 pulled forward or pushed back but most often, it\u2019s getting pulled forward than anything else. So hopefully, that answers the question, Mike. Mike Halloran : Yes. No, it does. I mean if I could put that last part in context, basically, it seems what you\u2019re saying is, you feel really good about where the order patterns are in the backlog patterns are, but don\u2019t overplay the magnitude of the backlog here because of the extended lead times. But you feel good about the visibility that you have going into the second quarter, which is more than you would normally have. Is that a fair interpretation? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. That is very fair, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. And I won\u2019t add anything more unless Joe you have something else to add to what... Joseph Kelley : Yes. I guess I just \u2013 when you think about the backlog, Mike, it is largely on the system side with these longer lead times, and there is a direct correlation when you look at our customer advanced payments. So our customer advanced payments year-over-year are also up 84%. So it\u2019s in line with the increase in the order backlog. So we think about the backlog as largely system orders, not necessarily past due items. And we\u2019ve got prepayments on those at that 10% of last year\u2019s backlog and 10% of this year\u2019s backlog. Mike Halloran : Good. Thank you. Really appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Connor Lynagh : Yes. Thanks. I was wondering if you could give a little bit of context on the logistics costs that you called out. And just specifically, is there \u2013 is one of the segments more disproportionately impacted by this? And is this something that was sort of isolated to the quarter? Or are you sort of accounting for this persisting in next quarter\u2019s guidance? Joseph Kelley : Yes. So let me address that. I guess, holistically, when we think about the 55.3% gross margin, first of all, that\u2019s gross margins coming off of a 10% organic growth and delivering 52% incremental margins at the OP line. But when you look at the 55.3% compared to where we were run in Q2 and Q3, it is down about 170 basis points. And when you think about that sequential drop, I would tell you, we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s roughly threefold. There is three relatively evenly split things, one of them being the spike in freight costs. In freight cost, it\u2019s inbound, it\u2019s outbound, but it\u2019s also internal within the Nordson facility. And so we saw this as did the rest of the environment spike in Q4. I can tell you, it spiked above where we had estimated, and it\u2019s starting to subside in the marketplace, already from those elevated levels that we saw in Q4, but we are addressing this with pricing actions in the first half here, of 2022. The other impact I would tell you was the nonrecurring write-off associated with aligning the factory, and that was all in ATS, to answer your specific question around the segments. That factory alignment was in our medical business and so that approximately $2 million impact on gross margins impacted ATS. The freight is felt across both segments. But I would tell you, it\u2019s heavier on the IPS side proportionately. And the remaining \u2013 the third factor I would tell you is mix. And so if you look at our gross margins over the history here, we view prior to the screw and barrel divestiture. We were running about 53% to 55% gross margin on any given quarter depending on mix. For the last now three quarters, we\u2019ve been running 55% to 57% based on the new mix post the divestiture of the screw and barrel business. So we \u2013 when we give our guidance for 2022, I would tell you, you should think about operating between that 55% and 57% gross margin range depending on mix on any given quarter. But those were the main factors I would tell you in the Q4 gross margin. Connor Lynagh : Got it. That\u2019s helpful context. I appreciate it. So sort of related question here, but at a higher level as you\u2019re looking into fiscal \u201822, it certainly seems like you guys are feeling pretty good about margins holding up relative to where we were in 2021. So just curious if there is any sort of inflationary pressures you\u2019re worried about and \u2013 on the cost side of things. Is there anything you\u2019re watching as sort of a swing factor on whether those margins will trend to the higher or lower end of your range? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Connor, let me just give you a high level color, and certainly, Joe will add some more to what I say. In general, we feel good about where we\u2019ve got margins forecasted, based on our current customer demand and segments, the various end market exposures we have. From an inflation perspective, there are two things you want to keep in mind, right? First and foremost, material cost is a fairly small part of our cost back, right, given our gross margins given about the value we create. That\u2019s sort of one thing to remember. The second thing to remember is that our cost to our customers is a smaller part of their total cost back. And so what that means is that we have a differentiated position and are able to pass along price increases where that is necessary. And we\u2019ve already done that in some businesses. Overall, we don\u2019t see this being a major factor for us into coming years. Joe, do you want to add any color to that? Joseph Kelley : That covers it. I mean we are closely monitoring it. And from an inflation perspective, both on the raw material side as well as the labor side, and then it was the logistics side. I would tell you that spiked in Q4 that impacted the margin slightly. I will also add, we see NBS Next efficiencies, helping offset some of this pressure. Efficiencies in terms of labor and conversion costs at several of our pilot sites. And so that has also helped our performance, and we anticipate that to continue to contribute favorably as we go into \u201822. Connor Lynagh : Got it. Appreciate it. I will turn it back here. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia with Berenberg. Your line is open. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning, guys. One thing if you look into your sales guidance for next year, if you back out NDC, the implied organic sales is more like mid-single digits. So I was wondering \u2013 I know you gave a lot of color already, but I would think that in some areas like medical and even electronics, you see a reacceleration, I think mid to late year. And I just wonder how conservative you\u2019re being on that with that as a dynamic in the forecast. Joseph Kelley : Yes. Andrew, let me make one then maybe I\u2019ll let Naga say something else. But when you think about our sales guidance for the full year, at the midpoint 8%, there is roughly about a 2% FX headwind that we\u2019re contemplating. And to your point, the acquisitions, net of \u2013 don\u2019t forget we have one quarter of the screw a barrel business. So the way that we\u2019re thinking about it is a negative 2% FX headwind. The net acquisition and divestiture is roughly favorable 3%, and then it\u2019s 7% organic growth is what we have. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Is there a way \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Sundaram Nagarajan : No, no, go ahead, Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : Well, I was just going to say, with medical, I would think that, that\u2019s being held up by recent variant activity again. So I would just think that, that would only be a nice tailwind as the year progresses. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. I \u2013 just historically, think about the medical business as high single digits or electronics, mid-single digits. We are in the early cycle of maybe third wave there on electronics. So you are right. In electronics, we\u2019re going to see some pretty nice growth. That\u2019s what is reflected in our guidance. In medical, we are expecting to have some pretty good return to the high single digits. Biopharma doing well. So if you think about all of that, these are going to be the big growth contributors. But look at the record year on our industrial business and consumer non-durable business in 2021. Our expectation is we do \u2013 we carry that strength into the first quarter. The back half of the year, there is going to be some tapering on those businesses, which had double-digit organic growth in consumer non-durable and in industrial businesses. So our expectation is some normalization in the back half for those businesses. But you\u2019re right. There is strength in medical. There is strength in electronics. That\u2019s what we have reflected. And what we are excited about is as you go into the first quarter, we are carrying the momentum of our second half of 2021 into 2022. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Is there a way in that backlog that you can identify what percent of sales is specific to electronics and medical? Joseph Kelley : Yes. I would tell you, pretty heavy on the system side. And on the electronics, there are a lot of systems businesses that we sell. But I can\u2019t tell you the split between electronics and medical. Sundaram Nagarajan : Well, we do have industrial systems that still need to get shipped out in the first quarter, too. That\u2019s in the backlog, actually. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, alright. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple of questions. You commented sort of the fact that we should not expect normal seasonality as it pertains to the first fiscal quarter of the year. But maybe Naga and Joe, if you can comment on how we should be thinking about the quarterly earnings cadence beyond that. In that, should we expect kind of the typical kind of fiscal Q3 being the high watermark for the year? What\u2019s the right way to be thinking about that, particularly as you see some tapering as you are describing, or at least expect to see some tapering as you are describing in nondurables and general industrial? Joseph Kelley : Yes. I think our comments around the normal seasonality, as you know, Q4 used to be the strongest. And here, we had Q4, which contributed $25 million of the revenue back into Q3. So, Q4 wasn\u2019t the strongest this year. And therefore \u2013 with coming off of Q4 being the strongest, we used to see a big drop into Q1. So, now you are not seeing the big drop. And actually Q1 will be comparable to Q4. And the way we think about then the remaining three quarters, I would tell you, with the current order entry pattern and the customer behavior that we are seeing, I would think about those quarters relatively evenly split as you think about the remaining three quarters of 2022. So, Q1 will still be relatively light compared to the other quarters, but not as dramatically light as it was in the past coming off of a strong Q4. Sundaram Nagarajan : Matt, one comment I would add to that is the ordering pattern of our customers are so different and expectation of shipments are so different. So, that\u2019s why you see us sort of changing what was traditionally a normal ordering pattern and a seasonality to our revenues on a quarterly basis. That\u2019s the big difference. The question really is when does \u2013 when do you return back to your normal seasonality, it\u2019s a perfectly good question to ask us. I wish I knew the answer to that. I would say, as our customer ordering patterns stabilize or some of these supply constrained questions that customers have in mind when they ease up is when we get to that. We are right now, at best, in the middle of this transition. So, I think at least for this year, we don\u2019t see our typical seasonality for that. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then as a follow-up, relative to what you would normally do from a pricing standpoint, is what you are contemplating for fiscal \u201822 more than you would normally seek to get. And if so if you could maybe perhaps quantify that a little bit for us? And then also just maybe a little bit of commentary on M&A actionability going forward as it pertains both to T&I and medical, recognizing you just completed a built on Fluortek? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Sure. On pricing, you are right. Our expectations for pricing is going to be higher than our normal price increases that we have got. And the timing of them is also reflective of what we see in our businesses, right. So, in \u201821, we didn\u2019t talk a lot about the price increases that we have already sort of acted on in \u201821 because they were not material in our work to move the needle for the total company. But in general, our view around pricing is that we are in an inflationary period. We need to adjust pricing where we need to adjust pricing. We are cognizant of the fact that we are the price leader in the marketplace. We are adding value. We will get paid for it. So, that\u2019s on pricing up. Now let me have Joe add a little bit more color on the sort of magnitude and such, and then I will come back and answer your acquisition question. Joseph Kelley : Yes. I guess, again, if you think historically, I would tell you, we would realize approximately probably 1% on price relatively correlated to inflation. And so when you see the elevated inflation numbers that are being reported, that\u2019s how you should think about our response as it relates to pricing. But again, I will go back to Naga\u2019s original comment. When you think about the composition of our cost of goods sold, material costs, the purchase component is not the largest factor. The largest factor is on the labor side. And that as we are generally a light assembly manufacturing operation. But you are correct, the price \u2013 the historical way that we view price increases and the historical magnitude is no longer applicable in an environment that we are in right now. Sundaram Nagarajan : I think, Matt, it\u2019s really important, right. The inflation is 4% or whatever, 4% or 5%. Our material cost tax is lower. So, the price increase we will realize would not be the same 4%, it would be different. Just want to make sure you got it. Yes. On the acquisition question, we feel really good about our pipeline. We continue to have very good conversations. But what comes to market and when a seller is going to act on an opportunity, really, we don\u2019t control, but we are actively pursuing our pipeline as we always do, and \u2013 but we would remain financially as well as strategically disciplined. And the areas we really like our test and inspection, medical. And there may be some adjacent call adjacent markets to our core products that if we have an opportunity, we might act on them as well. So acquisition pipeline, healthy, good activity, but what we act on obviously depends on what comes to the market. But you can expect this to remain disciplined. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Apologize for any background noise here I am jumping on a flight. But just kind of back on the industrial comment around tapering into the back half. Is there anything that\u2019s really informing that as you talk to your customers, or is that just your normal lack of visibility that would kind of want you to put some caution around that? Sundaram Nagarajan : Well, it is a couple of things, right. One, if you look at industrial CapEx activity as well as GDP activity over the cycle, you can start to expect that \u201823 is going to be a little bit lower than where we have been at, right. So, there is going to be a natural stabilization that goes. And so we expect that to get reflected in our business. That is one. The second is, the comps are going to be really difficult to you. So, think about the IPS business, that grew 15% in the back half. And this is a business historically grew 2% to 3%. And so as you think about year-on-year comps, the back half is going to get tough, right. And you are right. We don\u2019t have visibility to our industrial customers as we \u2013 as much as we have in other places. So, that\u2019s kind of where we are at. Hopefully, that \u2013 so it\u2019s three things that is going on that sort of informs our process. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just back on the non-recurring charges in medical. Can you just expand on where you \u2013 what you are doing there, and kind of where you are shifting your focus? Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. It is just a single R&D project that we were working on with one customer. On a product category, that was \u2013 let\u2019s just say a little bit away from where we were and where we see the best opportunities today. Our best opportunities are in biopharma. Without going into specific details of the particular customer and such, this is an R&D project we were working on with an inventor on the outside. And given the kind of robust demand that we have, and a very strategic discipline around where we want to grow this business. This is one that we needed to sort of stop doing and there was a write-off related to that asset. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Chris Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the update on Ascend strategy. I am curious where you are seeing \u2013 as you have been enacting this for a little while now, where you are seeing share gain, market space creation or enablement, not necessarily in a broad stroke level, but maybe some finer points on that. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. That would be great. Thanks, Chris. One of the areas and it\u2019s a good example to share with you that actually sort of dovetails to the question that Jeff just asked us. If you think about our biopharma business, one of the things that \u2013 as we deploy Ascend, as our teams use strategic discipline with NBS Next, and really begin to say, what is my market position in biopharma and how big is it, what are my core competencies, how can I continue to grow this, really, this just opened up a whole new opportunity for this team. Certainly, the market environment helped them, but it allows them to really focus on this biopharma part of the business, and grow it. And so what we are doing is as we invest more in biopharma, we continue to get new opportunities with existing customers as well as picking up new customers. And with existing customers, where we were, let\u2019s say, the number two or number three, we are moving up to number two or number one, right. So, that will be a concrete example of how this is happening. And another example I would give you would be in our coatings businesses. In the past, we would take almost every project at an equal weight. But now our teams are able to say, if I have 15 projects or 10 projects in front of me, what is the best growth-oriented project and what is the most profitable project, and have the courage to be able to invest more in the most profitable and most growth-oriented projects, and maybe deemphasize the ones that are not so profitable. Chris Glynn : Great. Thanks for that. And it looks like the book-to-bill was maybe a little over 1.1x. Curious of a couple of dynamics, I understand the extended and lead time and behavioral aspect. But curious of the organic book-to-bill by segment, approximate the impact of the acquisition. And then does guidance assume a reciprocal of book-to-bill at some point of the year where you just naturally flow into a negative book-to-bill given how backlog is formed currently, but maybe you might advise us not to read so much into it if a negative book-to-bill reciprocates. Sundaram Nagarajan : Joe? Joseph Kelley : Yes. I guess I would repeat some of Naga\u2019s comments, if you think about the strength in the electronics and the medical end market, those are predominantly that we see going out into 2022. We \u2013 those are predominantly in the ATS segment. Whereas the industrial and consumer nondurable where we see the growth rate stabilizing in the back half of 2022, that\u2019s predominantly in IPS. So, when you think about the book-to-bill ratio and the movements there as you are quoting, Chris. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to correlate by segment. Chris Glynn : Okay. Thanks. I will pick it up offline. Operator :  Our next question is from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks for getting me in. So, the earnings guidance of 8% to 18%, it\u2019s a pretty wide range. Could you just talk through the assumptions at the bottom and top end of the range, what do you need to see to hit the higher or lower end of your guidance? Joseph Kelley : Look, when we look out the range, to your point, Saree, is, plus or minus, I would say, 5%, 4% in terms of earnings guidance. And I think it was mentioned earlier on the call, the COVID is still out there. COVID and the variants, and what that does to the supply chain, what that does to the medical business, I think is a little bit uncertain. And so that contributed, I think to our guidance range the uncertainty around that. And the second is the inflation combined with some of the supply chain challenges that we saw spike in Q4, some of those supply chain challenges have started to mitigate here over the last, I would say, 30 days to 45 days to a degree. But how that handles \u2013 is handled going forward, I think will also impact our range. But really, we were pretty specific, I think, in terms of our guidance for Q1, where we do have good visibility where we are saying top line is 15% at the midpoint growth, consistent with what we have delivered over the last two quarters combined. And at the midpoint, the earnings growth in Q1 is at 40%, 50% incremental margins in Q1, consistent with what we just delivered here in Q4. So, we are trying to give, I would say, some clear guidance one quarter out, which is where we have better visibility, and then leaving a little bit broader range for the back half. Saree Boroditsky : Understood. And just a follow-up on the pricing question, within your top line guidance, you talked about organic growth of around 7%, the midpoint, how much of this is related to price versus volume? And then just on pricing, given the large backlog, how should we think about pricing rolling through the P&L in 2022? Joseph Kelley : Yes. So, let me take those, I guess in reverse order. You are correct. In some of our businesses, we had to go out with pricing actions earlier than at what I will call our fiscal year-end traditional practice given some of the inflation pressures that we were seeing, other businesses stuck with their year-end price increase. And so there will be a little bit of the timing issue, although not material and still hopefully we will be within our 55% to 57% gross margin range. But it will take some time for some of our pricing to take effect here as we rolled into 2022. When you think about the organic growth on the full year of 7%, we don\u2019t break that down specifically. But roughly, when I look at the business and the timing and the price increases, you can probably think that that\u2019s roughly 2% to 3% pricing. Saree Boroditsky : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport Research. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Good morning guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning Walter. Joseph Kelley : Hi Walter. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask about \u2013 kind of a follow-on to the last one with regard to the range, the gross margin of 55% to 57%. To hit the high end of your EPS range, would that imply that you are at the higher end of your gross margin range as well? Joseph Kelley : I think the higher end of the EPS range, I think I would tell you is more reliant on being at the high end of the revenue range. The margins throughout the year will fluctuate between that 55% and 57%. As you know, we delivered the last two quarters Q2 and Q3 were averaged 57%, roughly speaking. So, it will depend on product mix. But I think it\u2019s more contingent on the sales than where the margins drop out. Walter Liptak : Okay. And the sales \u2013 it sounds like \u2013 if there is any kind of caution or whatever, and the big range for 2022, it\u2019s around COVID and supply chain. So, you are talking about not demand risk, but you are talking about your shipment timing. Can you get the shipments out in 2022? Is that fair? Joseph Kelley : Well, I would also tell you that the COVID impacts demand, particularly in our medical space. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great. And I wanted just to review the \u2013 I think you made a comment that the last 12-week orders were up 25%. And I wondered if you could help us just get some visibility into that. Was that \u2013 what was the comp like? It sounds like it was strong in electronics and medical. Maybe what around both of those ATS segments? Is it semiconductor that\u2019s strong? Is it COVID-related medical, that\u2019s strong? Sundaram Nagarajan : Walter, I mean, we generally don\u2019t break order entry by categories. But my opening comments around where we are seeing strength in order entry is still the same, which is our electronic business order entry is pretty robust, pretty strong. If you think about our medical businesses, they continue to be pretty strong. And going into the first quarter, I would say the order entry for our industrial and consumer nondurable are also pretty solid. Joseph Kelley : And so from a time \u2013 Walter, I guess, going back, I think it was Chris\u2019 question of book-to-bill and what have you. It was really in Q2 that we started to see the ramp-up of last year. So, from a year-over-year comp standpoint, from an order entry rate standpoint, that\u2019s when the year-over-year comps on growth rates start to become more challenging relating to order entry. Walter Liptak : Okay. That makes sense. Okay, great. Alright. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. And I will turn the call back over to Naga for any closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Thank you for your time and attention on today\u2019s call. We are well positioned going into fiscal 2022. We remain focused on our long-term objective of delivering top-tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns as we deploy our NBS Next growth framework to prioritize organic and acquisitive growth opportunities while also unleashing an owner mindset within our customer-focused divisions. We wish you a happy holiday season. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the CyberOptics First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Subodh Kulkarni. Please go ahead. Subodh Kulkarni : Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for participating in CyberOptics earnings conference call for the first quarter of 2022. Joining me is Jeff Bertelsen, our CFO and Chief Operating Officer, who will review our results in some detail following my overview of our recent performance. We then will be pleased to answer your questions at the conclusion of our remarks. In keeping with Regulation FD, we have made forward-looking statements regarding our outlook in this morning\u2019s earnings release. These forward-looking statements reflect our outlook for future results, which is subject to a number of risks that are discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to review these discussions of risk factors. Turning now to our recent performance. CyberOptics reported strong sales and earnings in the first quarter of 2022. Each of our product groups, 3D and 2D sensors, semiconductor products and inspection and metrology systems posted strong double-digit year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter of 2022. The competitive advantages of these products are allowing CyberOptics to further penetrate our targeted growth markets in the areas of advanced Surface Mount Technology, or SMT, applications and semiconductor capital equipment. This makes us confident about CyberOptics second quarter and full year prospects. We reported sales of $24.2 million for the first quarter of 2022 ended March 31, an increase of 37% from $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $3.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share, an increase of 149% from earnings of $1.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the year earlier quarter. This strong operating results are evidence that CyberOptics is continuing to perform at a high level. Now for the next few minutes, I\u2019ll briefly review the performance of each of our product families. Sales of 3D and 2D sensors increased 27% year-over-year to $8.1 million in the first quarter of 2022. Within this category, sales of 3D MRS sensors rose 15% year-over-year to $4.9 million in the year\u2019s first quarter. Semiconductor inspection and metrology applications are continuing to generate demand for our 3D MRS-based sensors. Sales of 3D and 2D sensors are forecasted to post solid growth on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2022. Sales of semiconductor sensors, principally our WaferSense line of sensors, increased 34% year-over-year to $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. Strong global demand for semiconductors is in turn driving demand for semiconductor capital equipment where our WaferSense products are utilized. Sales of semiconductor sensors are forecasted to post strong double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2022. Sales of inspection and metrology systems rose 49% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2022 to $9.4 million. Driving this strong growth were sales of SQ3000 Multi-Function inspection systems, which increased 45% year-over-year to $5.9 million. This advanced product is continuing to gain traction among both existing and new customers. Total SQ3000 sales related to mini-LED applications came to $619,000 in this year\u2019s first quarter. In the first quarter of 2021, we did not book any mini-LED related SQ sales. As the year progresses, we anticipate receiving new orders for mini-LED related applications from both current as well as new customers scaling up production. We are confident mini-LED related inspection and metrology applications will make another strong contribution to our full year revenue stream. First quarter system sales benefited from customer acceptances of $1 million for 3D MX3000 Final Vision Inspection systems and sensor kits for memory modules. New orders totaling $3.5 million for 3D MX3000 systems were received during the first quarter, which brought our quarter ending MX backlog to $5.9 million. Orders in the current backlog are scheduled to be recognized as revenue over the balance of 2022. We expect to receive additional MX orders as the year progresses. Given normal sales fluctuations of capital equipment, inspection and metrology system sales are forecasted to be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter of 2022. CyberOptics backlog at the end of this year\u2019s first quarter totaled $47.4 million, up from $47.3 million at December 31, 2021, and $32.4 million at the end of first quarter of 2021. We are forecasting sales of $25 million to $28 million for the second quarter of 2022 ending June 30, compared to $25.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2021. Our sales forecast for Q2 assumes roughly $1 million of MX related revenue in the quarter. The lower end of our sales forecast assumes limited shipments of SQ systems to China in Q2 due to COVID-19. Our 3D MRS-based sensors and inspection systems and semiconductor sensors are enabling CyberOptics to capitalize upon significant growth opportunities in our targeted SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets. For this reason, we see 2022 shaping up as another good year for CyberOptics. Thank you. Now Jeff Bertelsen will review our first quarter performance in greater detail. Jeff Bertelsen : Thanks, Subodh. Our gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2022 was 47.8%, up slightly from 47.3% in the first quarter of 2021, but down from 49.6% in the fourth quarter of 2021. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin percentage stemmed from a slightly better sales mix and related gross margins on inspection and metrology systems sales. A slight sequential quarterly decline, which was previously anticipated and in line with our expectations heading into the quarter was mainly attributable to lower price points on SQ3000 system sales. Our gross margin percentage for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be down about 1 percentage point from this year\u2019s first quarter level, mainly due to revenue mix. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022 increased 15% year-over-year to $7.6 million. The increase was due to higher third-party channel commissions resulting from the significantly higher year-over-year sales, along with higher compensation costs for new employees and higher spending for trade shows. Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $569,000 in the first quarter of 2022, and stock compensation expense came to $353,000. Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2022 are forecasted to increase by a few percentage points on a sequential quarterly basis. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was 11% and was favorably impacted by an increase in the amount of income eligible for FDII and GILTI benefits due to a change in U.S. tax law requiring capitalization and subsequent amortization of R&D expenses. While the change is expected to have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in 2022, it will most likely increase the amount of cash we expend for income taxes, particularly in 2023 and later years. Cash and marketable securities totaled $38.2 million at the end of this year\u2019s first quarter, down slightly from $38.3 million at December 31, 2021 and up from $32.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2021. Given tight supply chains and extended lead times for certain key components needed to manufacture our products, we have deemed it prudent to keep additional inventories on hand, so we can meet anticipated customer demand, particularly SQ systems for mini-LED related applications. These extra inventories will be worked down to more normal levels as we progress through this year. I should also emphasize that to-date, part shortages and shipping delays have not had a significant impact on our business. And at this time, we do not anticipate a major impact going forward. We believe our capital resources are adequate for achieving our growth objectives. Our lineup of MRS-enabled sensors and systems and WaferSense semiconductor products are enabling us to capitalize upon important growth opportunities in our targeted markets. Our progress at penetrating our markets make us believe that 2022 is shaping up as another good year for CyberOptics. Thank you. We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from the line of Greg Palm. Please go ahead. Greg Palm : Subodh and Jeff, good morning. Congrats on the good results here. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Greg Greg Palm : Wanted to start off with maybe some high-level commentary. Subodh, maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from an industry demand standpoint? And just kind of remind us exposure to China. What are you seeing over there just given the lockdowns? Maybe just a little bit of color would be helpful? Subodh Kulkarni : Sure. We play both in the semiconductor as well as in the electronics manufacturing market. On a total basis, this market continues to be very healthy and growing in solid double-digits right now. The growth rate seems to be a little bit, getting to be a little bit slower than 2021. I mean 2021 was a great year for semiconductors and electronics and the reports say that the total market grew 20% to 25% in 2021. At this point, it looks like the growth rate will slow down a little bit from 2021 rates, but still very healthy, solid double-digit kind of a growth rate. Similarly, in 2020 \u2013 people are starting to \u2013 analysts are starting to project what will happen in 2023. Again, the growth rate is expected to slow down a little bit, but continue to be solid positive numbers. So China, clearly \u2013 and COVID issues in East Asia clearly are impacting all these numbers, that\u2019s why some slowdown is starting to happen. But despite all the factors, COVID factors, the geopolitical factors, the Russia/Ukraine war situation, the industry \u2013 overall industry semi and electronic pertains to be extremely healthy. Demand continues to be strong, and the markets continue to grow at a solid double-digit clip. So that\u2019s the overall macro backdrop commentary, if you will, from our perspective. Within that, we continue to do well. As you can clearly see our Q1, we had a great growth rate of 37%. We continue to believe we will grow solid double-digits through the rest of the year. So we feel pretty good about our position, our technologies, our products, in a healthy macro climate right now. Greg Palm : Okay. That\u2019s great. And specific to mini-LED, you mentioned that you still expect orders in 2022. What\u2019s your visibility at this point? And I mean, do you see any risk of stuff pushing just given what\u2019s going on with supply chain and the lockdowns over there in China? Subodh Kulkarni : There is some risk. I mean, clearly, the COVID situation in China, the chip shortage in \u2013 worldwide, and there are some specific chips that are needed for mini-LED applications. So some of those external factors may impact the scale-up rate. But directionally, we are pretty confident the scale-up is going on of different products. Different consumer electronics companies are getting into the market. So exactly as we have been predicting, mini-LED will continue to grow. Exactly which quarter and how many systems that\u2019s stuff to forecast, so it is possible given what\u2019s going around. There may be a few months delay. But overall, we feel pretty good that the mini-LED market will continue to grow at a healthy run rate, and we will continue to benefit from that by selling SQ systems in that marketplace. Greg Palm : And to be clear, you\u2019re expecting both significant orders and significant revenue generation in 2022, correct? Subodh Kulkarni : Correct. Greg Palm : Okay. Good. And then may be just one last one, more of a housekeeping question, the $5.9 million of MX backlog. Can you confirm whether that\u2019s all 3D? And how should we think about recognition of that full amount throughout the year? I think some in Q2 based on the mix comment. But should we assume that maybe 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 or how should we kind of think about it at this point? Jeff Bertelsen : Yes, so of the $5.9 million, $5.3 million of it is 3D. There\u2019s a little bit of 2D in it, but it\u2019s virtually all 3D. And then in terms of right now how we kind of see that laying out through the balance of the year, certainly, we\u2019re expecting $1 million in Q2. Right now, just using round numbers, I\u2019m anticipating $3 million done in Q3 and then the balance in Q4. As we get closer to the end of the second quarter, there\u2019s a chance that the $2 million in Q4 could move into Q3, but we\u2019ll know more about that in the next few months. Subodh Kulkarni : And we will certainly get more orders that have potentially impact Q3 and Q4 numbers. Greg Palm : Okay, great. All right. I\u2019ll hop in the queue. Thanks so much. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Greg. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Orin Hirschman. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Orin Hirschman : Hi, how are you? Congratulations on the result. Just a follow-up one or two questions from the last round of questions, in terms of the orders of the micro LED inspections. Does the China lockdown, does that affect that type of order flow or not so much because it\u2019s got to be done way in advance and are you hopeful that there will be more orders imminently? And has anything changed in the overall dynamic positive or negative for micro LED site? Subodh Kulkarni : So Orin, if I understand your question right, you\u2019re asking about the China lockdown and how does that impact the mini-LED overall business. Orin Hirschman : I\u2019m sorry the mini-LED, yes, I\u2019m sorry [indiscernible] I\u2019m sorry. Subodh Kulkarni : That\u2019s okay. So indeed, China lockdown unpredictability of how the lockdowns are being done is impacting how the scale up is happening in China because as of today, most of the manufacturing lines that are making mini-LED display are in China. So these lockdowns are impacting current production as well as investment plans. So it is a little uncertain on how things will go from here given the uncertain nature of their lockdowns. There\u2019s also another impact, which is \u2013 there are some custom chips that are needed for mini-LED displays and those chips are in short supply. So it\u2019s a combination of the China COVID lockdowns, and chip supply that are impacting scale of mini LED. Having said that, we still think it will continue to scale up. As I mentioned in the earlier question, there may be a delay of one month or two or three here, but nothing fundamentally changes. Mini-LED will continue to get scaled up, and we still feel pretty confident that the business will be a solid growth generator for us in 2022 and beyond. Orin Hirschman : And let\u2019s assume that the lockdowns lift, can you kind of recap in terms of \u2013 it\u2019s really been primarily one customer for you with influences on lots of other customers. As much detail as you\u2019re comfortable providing, kind of give us the lay \u2013 the inspection side in terms of one customer versus multiple customers, if any other dynamics? Subodh Kulkarni : There are multiple customers who are getting involved in mini-LED right now. It\u2019s no longer just a single customer situation. And there are many projects that are going on. Many of them are in China, and that\u2019s why the lockdowns and what happens is important. But there are other countries that are starting to get into mini-LED as well. So it\u2019s no longer a one customer, one country situation. Certainly, China is important and the primary, the consumer electronics company that started scaling up mini-LED is very important. But it is beginning to become more of an ecosystem now with more companies, more applications, more products. So we certainly expect growth to come from various different areas. Orin Hirschman : Have you actually, I apologize I don\u2019t recall do you actually ship to more than more customer? Subodh Kulkarni : We actually, as we have prior \u2013 previously disclosed, we have shipped many LED-related SQ systems to multiple customers. And some of them \u2013 many of them are contract manufacturers who service more than one or \u2013 consumer electronics companies. So yes, we are shipping mini-LED related equipped to multiple applications, multiple customers right now. Orin Hirschman : And I guess just my question was, for those customers, do those customers have multiple customers or just one huge customer? Subodh Kulkarni : Well, they do have multiple customers. We are just not sure of the ratio of one customer to the other customer. They don\u2019t disclose those details. Orin Hirschman : Got it. Subodh Kulkarni : But if you just do a research on mini-LED, micro LED right now, you can get a list of all the different kinds of projects that are going around in the world with mini and micro LED, and you will see a list of consumer electronics companies. And you may even see a list of contract manufacturers that support these consumer electronic companies. So the ecosystem is becoming broader than just a single customer and a couple of contract manufacturers. Orin Hirschman : And finally, my question on the new \u2013 one of the new businesses that you the wafer inspection side, you\u2019ve announced one big OSAT win. Are you hoping to announce \u2013 I guess maybe you\u2019re hoping to ship that system during this calendar year. And are you hoping to get other wins during this year \u2013 what\u2019s going on there? And has the lockdown affected that at all as well in terms of the progress getting to the next customer? Subodh Kulkarni : Sure, so if I understand your question right, it is about the WX product and how that scale up is going? Orin Hirschman : Yes. Subodh Kulkarni : So as we have disclosed before, we have two major customers right now for our WX system. One is we are servicing through our Chinese system integrator. So we actually sell only sensor and software in that case. The other major IDM, we sell the whole WX system. And so we have two customers we are servicing as of right now. We are talking to multiple other customers for WX. These are long evaluation processes take a long time for selection. They have to make sure that they go through all their analysis, and sometimes it takes months, if not quarters for them to come to that conclusion. As I mentioned before, in the semiconductor area, there is a significant concentration of customers. So there\u2019s, only 30 to 40 customers that matter in this space once you go beyond that the market will be very small. So every win is a big win, but it takes a long time to win. But right now, we feel pretty good about the two wins we have, and one of them has started scaling up aggressively. So we are scaling up multiple systems right now. The other one we still have to ship our first system, but we expect them to start selling getting \u2013 buying more once they are happy with the performance. And we are talking to more. So we are pretty confident we\u2019ll get a couple more by the end of this year. But it does take a long time to go through their evaluation processes and qualifications. Orin Hirschman : And just a follow-up on that \u2013 thank you for that clarification. That would be maybe give you more customers on the system side. So on that one large customer on the system side any idea when you\u2019re going to ship that first system? Subodh Kulkarni : It is sometime in this quarter. Frankly, it would have happened had it not been for the lockdowns in China that does impact because we are building the final system in China right now, and the lockdowns did impact us in getting the product built and shipped, but it should still happen this quarter. So long as the lockdowns become a little more reasonable. Orin Hirschman : And that is actually a bookable shipment in terms of the revenue comment? Jeff Bertelsen : Yes. That particular shipment right now, what we\u2019re anticipating is it will ship in the second quarter as Subodh said, and just given the customer acceptance on it mentally, we\u2019re assuming it will become revenue in Q3. Orin Hirschman : Got it. That\u2019s my question. And any guess \u2013 I know it\u2019s truly a guess that you tried how long the valuation will be with that first system I mean obviously, they\u2019ve done a lot of valuations with wafers et cetera, to get to this point to pull the trigger. But do you think it\u2019s a six-month wait, a nine-month wait or could be shorter than that and include? Subodh Kulkarni : Could be shorter but our experience suggests that it will be in the order of six months or so. They will thoroughly test the system in their production environment for the rest of this year, effectively before they issue multiple orders for the next system. Orin Hirschman : Okay. Thanks. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Orin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Greg Johnson. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Subodh and Jeff. Congrats on a great quarter. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Greg. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, if you could just give any color I know this is a ways off, but with the memory and semi incentives and some of the production builds that are going here. What are you seeing there? How would you have us think about when that comes on? And is there anything outside of those as far as \u2013 going to be even some of the consumer side that might be a little bit more domestic oriented? Subodh Kulkarni : If I understand your question right, Greg, you\u2019re asking us to comment about the memory industry in general and U.S. production of memory, is that correct? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. And how \u2013 there\u2019s so many things that are building out here as far as production and there\u2019s been some incentive, obviously, for less dependence in China and outside of the U.S.? Subodh Kulkarni : So the memory chip in market, if you will, I mean, it\u2019s dominated by three large manufacturers, Samsung, Hynix and Micron. Most of the fabs that these three companies have are not in China. They are in places like Korea, some in the U.S., Japan those kinds of places. So I don\u2019t think that, the whole China \u2013 related discussion becomes that important when it comes to memory chip manufacturing. Regarding your specific question about the U.S. production, I believe you\u2019re specifically referring to the CHIPS Act that is being discussed at Congress level right now. As far as I can tell, most of the discussion around that is centered around processor kind of chips. I haven\u2019t heard too much discussion about memory chips in that kind of discussion. And that\u2019s because of the significant exposure the world has when it comes to processor chips with respect to Taiwan and specifically TSMC. So that\u2019s where a lot of the discussion gets centered. I really see any discussion about memory manufacturing when it comes to the CHIPS Act. So I think memory is \u2013 just from our perspective, memory is a very healthy market right now. We believe it will continue to stay very healthy for all the reasons that we have discussed it in the past. And I don\u2019t think the U.S. CHIPS Act is going to significantly change where the chips are going to be made and those kinds of things. That may have more impact on the processor side and less on the memory side. Does that answer your question? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. And I\u2019m just \u2013 are you planning anything there as far as benefiting from all the build that is being done here? Subodh Kulkarni : Certainly, I mean, we play in the front end of semiconductor fabs with our WaferSense product line. We certainly play in the back-end area with our products like the memory module inspection, system MX or SQ and some of the sensors we sell and so on. So we play across the whole spectrum. And clearly, we have a big exposure to the memory manufacturers because of SQ and MX specifically. If more chips get made in the U.S., it\u2019s good for us. Obviously, we are here in this region. But in all fairness, I mean, right now, more than 80% of our sales come from outside the U.S., and we have successfully penetrated the fabs, even though they are in Korea, Taiwan and other countries. So that hasn\u2019t been a negative factor for us. Certainly, as U.S. citizens and stationed here, we would love to see more fabs here in the U.S. It helps all of us as a country. But I don\u2019t think we can say that our business has been gated because we are not in the U.S. as a fab. We have done a pretty good job of penetrating fabs whenever they are in the world. Did that answer your question, Greg, or do you have any further question? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I\u2019m good. Thank you very much. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Greg. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from the line of Eric Slade. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Eric Slade : Hey, congratulations Subodh, Jeff, another nice solid quarter. Yes, so since we Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Eric. Eric Slade : Yes, so since we\u2019re talking about memory, the last gentleman, you\u2019re still working on the third \u2013 you have the first two biggest memory guys. So that third one still, I would say, hot and heavy, right? Subodh Kulkarni : Absolutely, we continue to work with the third large memory manufacturer. They are a customer of ours for our SQ systems. So they know us pretty well and they are our customer of ours for WaferSense. So they know us pretty well. But so far, we have not been able to convince them to start buying our MX systems yet. Eric Slade : Okay. Something to look forward to. Now back to the mini micro it seems to be the topic today. So on that $25.2 million to \u2013 is it $25.2 million to $28 million guide. I take it that you don\u2019t expect \u2013 you guys never speculate. So in that $25.2 million to $28 million, is there any mini micro in that number in those revenues or no? Jeff Bertelsen : I mean there is \u2013 we aren\u2019t anticipating any new orders for Q2 for mini-LED in our Q2 guidance. There\u2019s a little bit of backlog left, and we\u2019re anticipating that. But no large orders are included in the guidance. Eric Slade : So really, as we\u2019ve talked before Jeff, these orders come sort of out of the blue, don\u2019t they? That you don\u2019t really know the plan till the end, right? Jeff Bertelsen : I mean we don\u2019t necessarily have great visibility, Eric. The customers don\u2019t go into a lot of details regarding their plans. So they do tend to show up when they show up. Eric Slade : So I guess my point is that $25.2 million to $28 million, if we get a nice lumpy order like we\u2019ve seen in the past, which probably should happen at some point here. Those numbers could be revised up quite nicely, right. We got a nice lumpy order? Jeff Bertelsen : Sure. It\u2019s possible. I mean if we get an unanticipated order, as you said, later in the quarter, I mean it\u2019s possible. But again, we\u2019re not including anything or necessarily expecting anything in our guidance. Eric Slade : Well, that\u2019s the way to do it. But so on the WX3000 we\u2019ll jump over there for a second. I think we\u2019ve talked about this before. You would think by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll start maybe seeing yes, about six months, right. We\u2019ll start seeing the ramp happening? Jeff Bertelsen : Yes. I think as we\u2019ve said, as the year progresses, I think we\u2019ll get some more orders for that. And so yes, it\u2019s certainly \u2013 over time, we certainly would see that business increasing as we continue to show the product and do more evaluations with customers, we anticipate more orders going forward. Eric Slade : Now the other question I have, the one last one on the Mini Micro is my understanding, the only way to really play it from a domestic side is on the back end and that would be Kulicke & Soffa and then yourselves, right. There\u2019s, no other public companies out there and I know Applied Materials goes \u2013 the big ones don\u2019t \u2013 aren\u2019t involved. Is that correct? Subodh Kulkarni : Well, it\u2019s a little more complex than that, Eric. I mean, the mini-LEDs themselves are made different kinds of fabs. Right now most of them are in Asia, then the transport process of the mini-LED from your semiconductor substrates to whatever substrate you want to use, whether it\u2019s plastic or glass, that\u2019s where we get involved. And certainly as you mentioned, could we get so far with that big sort of system plays and that we certainly with our SQ system play in it. There are a few other companies like the ones who make ovens and pick-and-place machines and other things that play in it as well. Then there\u2019s the whole final packaging process that makes the finish display. There are a few other companies that will get involved in it. So it\u2019s a little more complex than just one or two companies making the whole manufacturing lot. Eric Slade : No, I realized that. I thought a publicly traded companies, I guess that was my question. No, I know there\u2019s probably quite a few suppliers that \u2013 but I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re publicly traded, but that\u2019s not that important. The other question is, are your downstream from Kulicke & Soffa, right? Subodh Kulkarni : Well actually, we are both upstream and downstream. I mean we \u2013 there are \u2013 as we have discussed in the past, we have \u2013 there are six steps of inspection in that mini-LED is transferred to whatever substrate of choice. And there is a step \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of steps actually incoming inspection and solder pad inspections that happened before the pick-and-place operation happens, in click and so far six other system or some other pick-and-place system. So couple of our inspections happens before the pick-and-place and the other four inspection steps happen after the pick-and-place. So we have both upstream and downstream. Eric Slade : I was going to make a point real quick. I was looking through, I mean, micro it\u2019s hard to really get anything to concrete you go to their site. But I did pull something up and I might have forward it to you, Jeff. It mentions all these companies, I never really recognize Asian companies. It\u2019s got Kulicke & Soffa, but they don\u2019t even know you guys exist never seen CyberOptics in there. It just shows you how under-followed. So I don\u2019t know if you guys can do anything about that. But on some of the \u2013 I think in one chart in particular, they listed all the companies, a lot of charges has been listed companies and it was Kulicke & Soffa but no CyberOptics, just to point that out. But a great quarter and I look forward to the next one. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks, Eric. Jeff Bertelsen : Thanks, Eric. Operator : [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Dr. Kulkarni, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional closing remarks. Subodh Kulkarni : Thanks. Thank you all for your questions and interest. We look forward to updating you after our results in Q2. Thanks again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today\u2019s agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss second quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. Joe will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will conclude with a high level commentary about our enterprise performance as well as our updated fiscal 2022 full year and third quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2022 second quarter conference call.  Once again, the Nordson team successfully navigated a dynamic macro environment and delivered strong sales and earnings growth despite continued supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, as well as newer challenges from the COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the increasing foreign currency headwinds. I\u2019m very thankful for and proud of our employees who are staying safe and deploying the NBS Next growth framework to meet the strong broad-based demand from our customers. Our company culture is deeper than our financial results and during the quarter, I was humbled to see our employees rise up to send care packages to our colleagues impacted by the COVID-related lockdowns in China and also raise money for family and friends impacted by the situation in Ukraine. This is the Nordson impact, and it is a very special part of who we are as a company.  I\u2019ll speak more about the business in a few moments, but first I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joseph Kelley : Thank you Naga and good morning to everyone.  On Slide No. 5, you\u2019ll see second quarter fiscal 2022 sales were $635 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year\u2019s second quarter sales of $590 million. The increase was primarily related to 7% organic volume growth and 4% from the NDC acquisition offset by currency headwinds, particularly the weakening of the euro. The organic growth was broad-based across most end markets and geographies except for Japan and China. China COVID-related lockdowns negatively impacted second quarter sales by approximately $20 million as our Shanghai facility was unable to ship products for five weeks and many of our customers and freight forwarders were unable to receive or ship products. We clearly view this impact to be temporary and it is beginning to resolve itself as the lockdown restrictions start to ease. Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $358 million or 56% of sales, a 6% increase compared to the $338 million or 57% of sales in the prior year second quarter.  The team continues to actively manage the price-cost dynamic in these inflationary periods and benefited from improved price realization compared sequentially to the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Looking at the year-over-year margin decrease of 100 basis points, this resulted largely from a change in sales mix at the segment level as ATS delivered double-digit organic growth compared to the low single digit organic growth of IPS, plus the systems sales growth exceeded parts growth.  Operating profit was $184 million in the quarter or 29% of sales, an 11% increase from the prior year. Sales volume leverage and controlled spending contributed to the incremental operating profit margins of 38% in the quarter. Organic-only incremental operating profit margins were 70%, well ahead of our long term target of 40% to 45%. The NBS Next growth framework is clearly delivering tangible results. The strategic discipline element of the framework, which is a date-based view of the best opportunities in terms of customers, products and end markets, etc., this is driving improved sales mix within many of our divisions, resulting in strong growth and favorable incremental profit. EBITDA for the second quarter was $209 million or 33% of sales, well ahead of our long term target of 30%.  Looking at non-operating expenses, the increase in other net expenses of $36 million includes the $41 million one-time non-cash pension settlement charge. As we referenced in the first quarter call, we successfully annuitized the portion of our U.S. defined benefit pension liability associated with retirees in payment status during the second quarter. This transaction settled an estimated $178 million pension liability in exchange for plan assets totaling only 96% of the projected liability, leaving the remaining pension liability over 100% funded. This transaction not only removes significant risk from the company for the long term but also reduced our future pension cash funding obligations. The remaining $5 million year-over-year benefit included in other net expenses primarily reflects foreign currency exchange gains and ongoing non-operating pension benefits associated with plan assumptions and a reduction in amortization of actuarial losses. Tax expense was $30 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is slightly higher than the prior year\u2019s second quarter but in line with our forecasted full year rate for 2022.  Net income in the quarter totaled $110 million or $1.88 per share. Adjusted earnings per share excluding the non-cash pension annuitization charge totaled $2.43 per share, a 15% increase from the prior year. This improvement is reflective of the year-over-year increase in sales and more importantly the consistent application of the NBS Next growth framework, which leads to steady profitable growth with attractive incremental margins. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and 7 to review the second quarter 2022 segment performance. Industrial precision solution sales of $316 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year second quarter. Organic volume growth in the quarter was 3% plus another 7% from the NDC acquisition. This was offset by unfavorable currency of 4%. IPS\u2019 organic growth was driven by robust demand for polymer processing product lines plus steady broad-based growth in consumer non-durable end markets for hot melt adhesives dispensing in all geographies except China. COVID-related lockdowns in Shanghai negatively impacted this segment\u2019s second quarter sales by approximately $15 million. Operating profit for the quarter was $102 million or 32% of sales, which is a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year operating profit of $104 million. Favorable sales volume leverage in the quarter was offset by unfavorable mix compared to the prior year second quarter as the majority of the growth was from polymer processing systems and the NDC acquisition.  Moving now to advanced technologies and solutions, sales were $319 million, a 10% increase compared to the prior year second quarter, which is a new quarterly record for this segment. This change included an increase in organic sales volume of 11% offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Growth was across most major product lines but particularly strong in the electronics dispense, test and inspection, and biopharma fluid component product lines. All geographies with the exception of China contributed to this quarter\u2019s growth with particular strength in the international regions. Second quarter operating profit was $98 million or 31% of sales. The 29% increase over the prior year operating profit of $77 million was driven by sales volume leverage and the realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in fiscal 2020 and early 2021. This segment continues to deliver impressive sales growth at very attractive incremental margins and the 31% operating profit in the quarter reflects a new record level performance for ATS. Deployment of our NBS Next growth framework continues to be a key element in the success of this segment delivering profitable growth. Finally turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8, through our disciplined approach to capital deployment and strong operating profit growth, we ended the quarter with a healthy balance sheet and abundant borrowing capacity. Cash totaled $121 million and net debt was $670 million, resulting in 0.9 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. Free cash flow in the quarter was $84 million or a conversion rate on net income of 77% as strategic investments are being made in inventory to address portions of the current supply chain constraints and support the growing backlog.  During the second quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends and spent $105 million on repurchasing approximately 470,000 shares of company stock through our 10b5-1 repurchase plan. For modeling purposes in fiscal 2022, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 21% and capital expenditures of approximately $45 million. I will now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you Joe. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Again, thank you to the Nordson team for delivering this outstanding performance. I\u2019m very proud of how our employees are navigating this dynamic environment. I continue to spend a lot of time in our facilities and I am excited by the caliber of talent and the dedication of our employees to meet our customer commitments despite the constraints of the supply chain. They are actively deploying NBS Next to choose the best growth opportunities and focus their time and resources appropriately.  Strategically, we have continued to make progress on the advancement of the NBS Next growth framework, the heart of our Ascend strategy. NBS Next boils down to three words : choices, focus, and simplifying. Expanding beyond our pilot sites, we now have several strong business examples of driving profitable growth in different divisions. With this in mind, we launched a four-month NBS Next accelerator training program which had its first in-person session in April. In the program, Nordson participants learned through hands-on exercises with real Nordson data as well as in-class discussions. More importantly, each participant left with a better understanding and a thoughtful action plan that will accelerate the deployment of the NBS Next growth framework across the company.  As practical application of NBS Next gets embedded deeper in our organization, the more aligned and skilled we are as a team to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. This is an important investment in our people and company. I\u2019m grateful to the Nordson team for all that is being done to mitigate risks due to supply chain, inflation, labor, and COVID challenges.  In this dynamic environment, I\u2019m equally energized the secular growth drivers in key end markets leading to strong ongoing demand from our customers. As Joe noted, our ATS segment delivered record sales and profits. It is driven by Nordson\u2019s ability to deliver on exciting trends in electronics, including investments in both capacity and on-shoring, new product innovation, and the continued demand for semiconductors and PCBs. Both our electronics dispense and T&I product lines will continue to benefit from these trends. The medical end market also continues to grow. While we have talked at length about the growth in our biopharma fluid components, we are also experiencing the recovery of our interventional solutions product lines which are fueled by the aging population, shifts towards outpatient procedures, and medical OEM outsourcing. The diversity of Nordson\u2019s end markets and geographic exposure as well as high recurring revenue content positions us well to deliver consistent profitable growth through the economic cycle. Now let\u2019s turn to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook on Slides 10 and 11. Order entry remained strong throughout the second quarter with a favorable book to bill ratio growing backlog to over $1 billion. This growth in backlog is partially related to the ongoing extended shipment request dates for large customer orders in electronics, industrial and medical end markets. Looking specifically at the third quarter fiscal 2022, revenue and adjusted earnings are forecast to be comparable to the prior year results where the prior year third quarter was the strongest quarter of fiscal 2021.  For the full year fiscal 2022, we are guiding to a revenue growth of 8% to 9% and we are increasing the previously issued adjusted earnings guidance to the range of 18% to 21% over fiscal 2021. This is approximately 20% earnings growth following a record 2021 financial performance. It is a testament to the solid execution of the SN strategy. Our financial results and expectations for growth reflect our differentiated precision technology, customer-centric model, and diversified end markets. Additionally, the ongoing implementation of NBS Next is making sure we have a crystal clear view on priorities in this dynamic environment. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders, and the Nordson team for your continued support.  With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions. Obviously the second quarter was impacted by about $20 million related to the mandated COVID-related lockdowns in China. What sort of net impact do you expect in fiscal Q3, meaning are you still seeing top line impact today but on a net basis, given $20 million effectively pushed, do you think that is a net positive to your Q3? I guess I\u2019m trying to understand how that dynamic plays into the go forward views here. Joseph Kelley : Yes Matt, thank you for the question. As it relates to our forecast and our guidance for Q3 and the lockdowns in the Shanghai region of China, we anticipate those to start to subside. We\u2019ve had no shipments for five weeks in Q2 and so we\u2019re starting to--things are starting to open up there, we\u2019re starting to get people back in the factory, we\u2019re starting to be able to ship. We\u2019re not yet at 100% but we anticipate being 100% roughly by mid-June, so that is what\u2019s included in our assumption. Matt Summerville : Then you had very strong quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year incrementals in ATS, part of that attributable to some actions that you\u2019ve taken on the cost side, also expense discipline. Go forward, how should we be thinking about maybe the forward-looking margin cadence in ATS specifically? Thank you. Joseph Kelley : Yes, so when you think about ATS, any given quarter there\u2019s a handful of mix that will impact any results, so I don\u2019t want to take one given quarter and say, annualize it. But I encourage us to look at the trend in ATS, and what you see going on over the last several quarters is consistently improving the profitability of that segment. It\u2019s kind of like the driver there, Matt, is the comment that I said in the script in terms of NBS Next, is that segment not only does the cost control, which you referenced, but from a gross margin and a profitability standpoint and the strong incrementals is really coming from improving mix within each of the divisions in that segment, so if you think about NBS next and strategic discipline, which is a database framework to say, what are my best growth opportunities, as those individual divisions are focusing on those best growth opportunities, they generally are the higher margin opportunities, and so as we outgrow in those high margin product lines, regions, end markets, it\u2019s improving the mix within those divisions.  That\u2019s what\u2019s contributing to those favorable incremental margins in ATS, and we\u2019re quite proud of that trend. I don\u2019t know that I can say, hey, Q2 is now the ongoing run rate, but directionally that\u2019s what you\u2019ll continue to see. Matt Summerville : Understood, thanks Joe. Joseph Kelley : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Hammond with Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning everyone. Joseph Kelley : Morning Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Can you just talk about the durability of the growth you\u2019re seeing in electronics and test and inspection? We\u2019ve heard kind of a line of tough comps and the consumer starting to slow here around mobility, PCs, etc., and just wanted to get what you\u2019re seeing on a go-forward basis. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, thank you for the question, Jeff. On our electronics business, what we see is this [indiscernible] of our customers and applications that we have undertaken over the last number of years, that you begin to see the business doing incredibly well in a couple of different areas. One of the areas is really semiconductors, and what we find is the ongoing capacity additions, on-shoring to mitigate some risks that all of us see in the industry, but in addition to that digital technology and digital way of doing business has just spurred this new secular growth that we see our customers continuing to benefit for some time to come.  From what we see in our businesses, our order rates are pretty strong, our shipments are pretty strong in the electronics area, so now just as a reminder, we have electronics dispense as well as test and inspection both benefiting from it, so in the quarter both the divisions had double-digit growth. Certainly there are comp issues, but we feel really good about prospects for these divisions and their contribution to growth for us.  We do have lesser exposure--you know, we have a broad-based supply chain we participate in, in electronics, so it is less correlated to one particular consumer product or the other. That used to be where we were a number of years ago, and we have talked to you about how we have diversified our applications, and so think of Nordson\u2019s electronic business participating in the entire electronics supply chain and that diversity is really helping us participate in a good way. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Then I just wanted to come back on this dynamic around the timing of the backlog and customers saying they want things a little bit later, because it seems like most of my other industrial companies have big backlogs and it\u2019s more a function of we can\u2019t get stuff out the door, and we\u2019re--you know, the order rates are just outpacing what we can deliver. Yours just seems a little bit different, and I just wanted to understand why it shakes out that way. Sundaram Nagarajan : Jeff, that\u2019s a great question. In terms of our backlog, I wouldn\u2019t say we don\u2019t have the issue that you\u2019re talking about - orders ahead of shipments. We do have some of that, right - we are limited by the supply chain, meaning how much our suppliers can provide us in terms of components, especially for our systems business to be able to ship, so that is still a factor in our backlog.  The second factor, though, is we are seeing clearly, and we have pretty good line of sight to understand that we have customers placing orders ahead of where they normally have, and we see that mostly in our system business, now we\u2019re seeing it in our interventional components business, medical interventional components business as well. If you look at our backlog, the majority of our backlog is from systems businesses and medical businesses, and partly driven by these long-dated customer request dates. Jeff Hammond : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to stick on that backlog theme. I know there\u2019s certainly an extended backlog here. Is there a way to better understand the extent of that extension, meaning is it two weeks extended, is it a month, a quarter? Just any color there, and then just any thoughts on risk of cancellation in that backlog or double ordering, which I know is a concern of folks. Just any thoughts there, thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, thank you Allison. Let me take the cancellation first and then we\u2019ll talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing in terms of customer long-dated requests. On cancellation, that\u2019s something that we monitor very closely in the business. Given our direct customer business model, it allows us much more insight into customer thoughts, sentiments and behavior, right? In general, we have not had issues around cancellation, and so from our perspective that\u2019s not manifesting itself in the business today.  The second thing I would tell you is also remember we--you know, more than 50% of our business is very system oriented, engineered systems, so this is not like you could buy it in a couple of different places. Once you place a system order that is very customized to your own application, that is a benefit for us, right, so from a cancellation perspective we have not seen it in the business now. The second question around long-dated customer requests, I\u2019ll give you a couple of anecdotal things that we see in the business as sort of indicative of what we are experiencing. One, in a couple of our system businesses, we have orders now that are dated to be shipped in second quarter of next year. In the past, the norm was you would get three, six months out request dates, and now we\u2019re starting to see three, four quarters out, so that\u2019s one. Second is in our medical businesses, medical interventional business, we typically get blanket orders and those blanket orders cover us for a quarter of two, but now we\u2019re getting blanket orders for a longer period of time, so those would be two anecdotal evidences that indicates what we\u2019re seeing in our business. Joe, you want to talk a little bit about customer prepayments that might give an indication of what we\u2019re seeing in the [indiscernible]? Joseph Kelley : Yes Naga, so Allison, we also track not just cancellations and are looking out for that, but also our customer prepayments, and as the majority of the backlog is comprised of systems and medical orders, as Naga mentioned, those systems orders come with customer prepayments, and those are up now north of $90 million, and so proportional to our systems backlog, the prepayments have also grown. We view the systems backlog piece as very solid as it relates to future shipments, and the visibility is out now several quarters whereas our traditional, I\u2019ll call it non-systems heavy business, parts business, we see a modest uptick in the backlog but that is much more book-and-ship within a couple weeks, so that one is not out nearly as far. Allison Poliniak : Great, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Then just price realization, Naga, I think you had mentioned sequentially improved. Are you in a more favorable price-cost situation today, and are you still comfortable with that second half being a net positive for Nordson going forward? Joseph Kelley : Yes Allison, when you look at our performance going Q1 to Q2, actually our price realization was a little bit better than what we had anticipated going into Q2. It\u2019s forecasted to continue to improve here in Q3 again as we work through the re-pricing and the long backlog, so it was favorable in dollar terms in Q2 and was forecasted to slightly improve as we head into Q3, so we feel pretty good about that. I will tell you it\u2019s a very dynamic situation with all the different cost components and the inflationary pressures. Allison Poliniak : Great, thank you. Operator : Again if you\u2019d like to ask a question, that\u2019s star, one on your telephone keypad. Our next question is from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Hey, morning. Again, just to kind of keep pulling the thread on backlog a bit here, your guidance commentary implies most of the year-over-year growth that is expected in the back half kind of shows up in the fourth quarter, I guess. Can you give us a sense for just how confident you are in that cadence and just what\u2019s the risk that we could see a piece of that fall into fiscal \u201923? Just any kind of sense for how fluid some of those orders are versus your confidence in seeing the growth in the fourth quarter. Joseph Kelley : You bet, Chris. Yes, let me comment, if I could, just on the quarterly split of our guidance here in the back half. If you think about our guidance, midpoint the back half is going to be up roughly 6% over the prior year. I will remind you in the prior year, Q3 was our strongest quarter and there was about $25 million worth of sales that we were able to get out in the electronics space in Q3 that was pulled forward based on a customer request from Q4 scheduled delivery into Q3. Q3 was strong, Q4 was sequentially softer last year, and so what you see this year is--you know, I would tell you 6% growth over the second half, but you\u2019re right, it implies the fourth quarter is going to be stronger than the third quarter, so what you see there is heavy, again, visibility on the systems side and so a high degree of confidence on the system forecasting, and also as I mentioned in the first question, the China lockdown, and as that starts to moderate here and still impacts us a little bit in Q3, that will be a challenging Q3. So Q4 stronger than Q3, I wouldn\u2019t get carried away with the quarter year-over-year growth rates and think about it more as 6% growth in the back half, and if you think about that broken down, I would tell you FX is about a 3.5% to 4% headwind, acquisitions is about a 3% to 4% tailwind, and so it\u2019s really roughly 6% to 7% organic growth is what we\u2019re forecasting in the second half, and good visibility on the systems side. Your question about supply chain constraints, and look, it is a dynamic environment, it requires us to get the material and be able to ship it, but we\u2019ve been quite successful, I think, in delivering growth over the past five quarters, averaging greater than double digit organic growth, so I\u2019m optimistic that we will be able to deliver that here in Q4. Sundaram Nagarajan : You know, one thing, Chris, I would add too is given our organizational structure, right - over the last 24 months, we have gone to an owner mindset, division-led structure, this allows our divisions to forecast in a fairly crisp way as they--you know, we have a direct customer business model so each of our divisions have fairly good visibility, and our forecast was really based on our divisions\u2019 forecast, so this is not something that Joe and I decide as much as we--you know, this is a sum of all of our divisions\u2019 views of where the market is at and their own supply chain, so we feel good about where we are because I think it does give us better clarity into where we are expecting our customers to perform division by division. Chris Dankert : Got it, thank you both. That\u2019s incredibly helpful color.  Then not to pin you down, but I\u2019m going to try and pin you down a bit here. Circling back to the ATS margin question, I guess in the past, mid-20s was kind of the EBIT margin target there. Is it fair to say that, hey, we\u2019ve at least moved into a high 20s target cross-cycle here, or am I kind of overstepping on that? Joseph Kelley : No, that\u2019s what I kind of meant by the trajectory is what we\u2019re looking at and then the long term gains. If we look at that business, it went from operating at EBIT margins around 20, last year stepped up to the mid to low 20s, and this year we\u2019re running in the high 20s on average for the first half, so I think that trajectory is the way to think about this business in terms of running the NBS Next playbook.  Naga, you wanted to add something? Sundaram Nagarajan : Hey Chris, sorry to interrupt you, but before we take and put it down, I wanted to add a little bit of color there just to make sure. We have materially improved the cost position, structure position in this business, so we feel really good about those gains. The only caution I would have for you--you know, two things. One is, as Joe mentioned, this is one quarter, and second I\u2019d also say that we have--you know, we\u2019re doing really well on the electronics business, which as you know has--the amplitude of the cycle has muted because of the diversification work we\u2019ve done, but it is still a cycle, so we\u2019re in a good part of the cycle, we have taken cost out, we\u2019ve materially improved the position of the business well, we have mix help in there, so there are a number of contributing factors, so my caution would be let\u2019s give it a couple of quarters here before we lock in a run rate. Chris Dankert : Totally fair, thanks so much for--oh, go ahead? Joseph Kelley : Yes, quite simply there\u2019s a lot of things going on there, and one of them also is the top line growth. I mean, this is a record sales quarter for this segment, and so as you think about driving that growth, you get that natural leverage as well, and so it\u2019s not just the profitability, it\u2019s also the growth that that\u2019s delivering - I mean, 11% organic growth in the quarter despite all these challenges. Chris Dankert : I guess to that end, I\u2019d assume facility utilization has got to be at or near a record, no? Joseph Kelley : Well you see on the capex side in this business, we are making investments to expand capacity where needed to support this growth, particularly in the electronics space and then the medical space, which we\u2019ve highlighted as the high growth areas. You see we spend--you know, although it\u2019s a small number percentage speaking, but it is an increase, and $24 million on capex year-to-date, and so we continue to add capacity where needed, although it continues to be capital-light. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes Chris, on the capacity side, on our assembly business, think of that as capacity we have but more constrained by the supply chain and our ability to get components to fully support the demand. That\u2019s one capacity that you\u2019ve got to take into consideration beyond our own ability to act on [indiscernible] and the backlog, so that\u2019s one. On the process side, which is sort of what Joe has mentioned, we\u2019re adding capacity where there it is physical capacity within the company, but we are excited about the capacity adds we are making in businesses that have very strong growth, really great investments for the company and our investors. Chris Dankert : Understood, well thank you both so much for the color. Much appreciated. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Walt Liptak with Seaport. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone. Joseph Kelley : Good morning Walt. Walter Liptak : I wanted to ask a follow-on - you know, as we\u2019re thinking about the second half, if there\u2019s going to be more systems shipped in the fourth quarter, does that have an impact on the fourth quarter gross margin? My recollection is that parts might be higher margin and systems might be lower. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that. Joseph Kelley : Yes, I would--you know, you are correct at a high level, although I would tell you the disparity between parts and systems is not that great, but you are correct at a high level. I would tell you there\u2019s a couple things offsetting that. Perhaps as you go into Q4, as you think about Q4, one is the sales volume leverage, and then two is the price-cost realization. I think that will improve sequentially from our Q2, so as we think about going from Q1 to Q2 improved, Q2 to the back half, that should also improve. Then I would also tell you, Walt, within the systems business, that\u2019s a big bucket, there is opportunities for mix within that, and when you think about the mix within the systems business, there is opportunity for that to be favorable, so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think about margin degradation as we go into Q4. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. If I could try one on the IPS segment, the 30% organic, I wonder if you could parse out what the price was versus units, and are you seeing unit growth? Joseph Kelley : Yes, I would tell you price was a component of that 3%, but there was also unit growth as well. It wasn\u2019t simply price. Price wasn\u2019t the full 3%. Sundaram Nagarajan : And also, Joe, this is the segment we had more currency headwinds too, right? Joseph Kelley : Correct, so the currency headwind in this segment was 4%, and that was greater than that in the ATS segment due to the large European business that we have here. But specifically looking at the organic piece, I would tell you there was volume growth in there. That\u2019s not just all price. Walter Liptak : Okay, all right. Great.  Then just a last one, thinking about China and the reopening, I guess as your employees get back to work, I wonder, is this something where you think it will ramp quickly or do you think China is going to have its own supply chains and this will be a slower ramp? How long do you think it will take to get China back to normal? Sundaram Nagarajan : You know, we have been slowly bringing people back as the government allows us to, and we believe it will be a slower ramp but we also believe that we would be fully operational at normal run rates hopefully in the next four to six weeks, so mid-June that Joe mentioned in his earlier comments, that\u2019s our expectation. But Walt, business, a dynamic environment that none of us really controls, our teams are doing one incredible job dealing with where we are, and we are so proud of how our leadership and our teams have worked together and are really--and teams around the rest of the world who have to work around this issue in China, so it\u2019s not only that we have our China factory and our shipments in China, but we also have customers who pull from our other factories, so all in all very proud of the work our teams are doing in some very incredibly difficult situations.  Our expectations are things are doing well, things are coming back, but surely expect a slower ramp with an expectation that another four to six weeks, we get back to normal shipping rates. For us, I couldn\u2019t emphasize this more - safety of our people is our number one priority, and everything else will work out. But we\u2019re just so proud of the team there and I\u2019m proud of everybody around the world who have been working to overcome the challenges we have had in China in the quarter and as we get into third quarter, so a big shout-out to the Nordson team. Nice job for us. Walter Liptak : Okay, that sounds great. Good luck with that ramp in China, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Thanks. Joseph Kelley : Thank you Walt. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn it over to Naga for any closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Our continued performance reflects the strength of our differentiated positioned technology, customer-centric business model, and diversified end markets. The continued deployment of NBS Next and the Ascend strategy will ensure we remain well positioned in this dynamic environment. Thank you for your time and attention on today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Thank you. Ms. Mahoney, you may begin your conference. Lara Mahoney : Thank you, good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I\u2019m here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO, and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, August 23 to report Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2022 third quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today\u2019s call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until August 30, 2022.  During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson\u2019s current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today\u2019s agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss third quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the two business segments. Joe will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will then share a high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including an overview of the CyberOptics acquisition announcement. He will conclude with a review of the fiscal 2022 full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2022 third quarter conference call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to congratulate the Nordson team for delivering another record third quarter. As you may recall, we reported record sales and profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. The fact that the team delivered above this result is a true testament to our differentiated precision technology, customer-centric model, effective deployment of the NBS Next growth framework, and the dedicated Nordson employees who are driving our strong profitable growth. I\u2019ll speak more about the business in a few moments, but first, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joseph Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide #5, you\u2019ll see third quarter fiscal 2022 sales were a record $662 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year\u2019s third quarter sales of $647 million. The increase was primarily related to 4% organic volume growth plus the NDC acquisition, offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 5%. On a constant currency basis, our sales increased 7% compared to prior year third quarter, which was the previous quarterly sales record.  The organic growth was broad-based across most end markets and geographies except for Asia Pacific, which was impacted by the Shanghai, China COVID lockdowns for the first month and a half of this fiscal third quarter, as expected. We are very thankful for the outstanding efforts of our China employees as their return in full force helped to offset a significant portion of the lockdown impact and contributed to the record sales quarter. Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $366 million or 55% of sales, a slight increase compared to the $365 million or 57% of sales in the prior year third quarter. Excluding one-time restructuring costs, adjusted gross profit totaled $368 million or 56% of sales. The team continues to actively manage the price-cost dynamic in these inflationary periods in addition to unfavorable currency impacts.  Operating profit totaled $185 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded one-time restructuring costs associated with a facility consolidation in the EFB division of the ATS segment and the closure of our Russian operations. Adjusted operating profit, excluding these non-recurring items, was $188 million in the quarter or 28% of sales compared to the strong prior year third quarter operating profit of $188 million.  Organic sales volume leverage contributed to the operating profit result and was offset by unfavorable currency impact and inflationary pressures. EBITDA for the third quarter was $213 million or 32% of sales, which is ahead of our long-term target of 30%.  Looking at non-operating expenses, other net expenses decreased $3 million primarily driven by lower non-operating pension costs and foreign currency exchange gains. Tax expense was $39 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is in line with our prior year third quarter rate and the forecasted full year rate for 2022. Net income in the quarter totaled $142 million or $2.45 per share. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding severance and facility closure costs, totaled $2.49 per share, a 3% increase from the prior year. This improvement is reflective of the year-over-year increase in sales and, more importantly, the consistent application of the NBS Next growth framework which leads to steady, profitable growth.  Now let\u2019s turn to Slides 6 and 7 to review the third quarter 2022 segment performance. Industrial precision solution sales of $341 million decreased 1% compared to the prior year third quarter, but grew 5% on a constant currency basis, with the NDC acquisition providing a 7% sales increase which was offset by an organic volume decrease of 1%. The unfavorable currency impact on this segment was 7%.  The organic 1% decrease needs to be properly interpreted as IPS\u2019 third quarter 2021 was a very strong quarter, 10% above the quarterly average in fiscal 2021 as it was inclusive of several large system orders which customers pulled forward. Also, the IPS segment\u2019s China operations are headquartered in Shanghai and therefore the segment was disproportionately impacted by the COVID lockdowns in May and June of this year. The organic growth, excluding these factors, was driven by robust demand for packaging and product assembly product lines in the food and beverage industry and industrial end markets in most geographies.  Operating profit for the quarter was $120 million or 35% of sales, which is a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year operating profit of $124 million. Unfavorable currency negatively impacted operating profit despite comparable sales to the prior year record third quarter. Moving now to advanced technology solutions, sales were $321 million, a 7% increase compared to the prior year third quarter and sequentially beat the second quarter 2022 quarterly revenue record for this segment. The record quarterly sales included an increase in organic sales volume of 10% offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Growth was across all major product lines but particularly strong in the electronics dispense and biopharma fluid component product lines. All geographies contributed to this quarter\u2019s growth with particular strength in the international regions. Third quarter fiscal 2022 results for ATS included $2.5 million of non-recurring facility closure expenses associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations within the EFD division. This consolidation will enable improved operating efficiency and customer service levels to support the growth of this division once complete. Third quarter adjusted operating profit excluding the consolidation expense was $89 million or 28% of sales, an increase of 10% over the prior year operating profit of $81 million. The profit growth was driven by sales volume leverage offset partially by currency and inflationary pressures. This segment continues to deliver impressive sales growth at very attractive 40%-plus incremental operating profit margins. Deployment of our NBS Next growth framework continues to be a key element in the success of this segment delivering profitable growth. Finally turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 8, our third quarter balance sheet includes cash of $129 million and net debt was $675 million, resulting in a 0.9 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12-months EBITDA. We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, such as the CyberOptics acquisition announced on August 8. Free cash flow in the quarter was $111 million or a conversion rate on net income of 78% as strategic investments are being made in inventory to address portions of the current supply chain constraints and increase capacity to address the growing backlog. Dividend payments were $29 million in the quarter and our board approved a 27% increase in the annual dividend effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. This marks the 59th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. The significant increase of 27% reflects the strength of our financial results, which are driven by our continued progress in executing the Ascend strategy combined with the desire to maintain targeted payout and yield ratios. The annual dividend yield now will be slightly over 1% at current market prices. Also, with the ongoing market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunistic repurchase of shares. Year to date, we have spent over $230 million on share repurchases averaging a price of $219 per share. For modeling purposes in fiscal 2022, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 21% and capital expenditures of approximately $50 million.  I will now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you Joe.  We are working through incredibly dynamic times, yet our teams continued to meet the needs of our customers. It is their dedication and focus on our customers that resulted in another record-breaking quarter. I want to pause and say thank you to our employees. You make these results possible.  We continue to manage through the challenges of the short term macro environment and we are making solid progress on our Ascend strategy. As illustrated on Slide 9, we announced our decision to realign our business segments to better focus on our best profitable growth opportunities. Effective August 1, we reorganized into three financial reporting segments. Industrial precision solutions led by Jeff Pembroke will focus on proprietary dispensing and processing technology for adhesives, coatings, paints, finishes, and other materials across diverse end markets. Jeff joined Nordson in 2005 and has driven growth in multiple businesses across Nordson. He also was instrumental in the development of our medical platform.  The new medical and fluid solutions segment will include Nordson\u2019s fluid management solutions for medical, high tech industrial, and other diverse end markets. This remains one of the company\u2019s growth engines both organically and acquisitively. This segment is being led by Stephen Lovass. Stephen joined Nordson in 2016 as the leader for the industrial coating solutions business. In 2020, he was appointed the head of our Strategy and Corporate Development group where he has actively advanced our Ascend strategy.  Finally, our advanced technology solutions segment will focus on test and inspection, precisely controlled dispensing, and surface treatment for electronics applications. Srini Subramanian is leading this segment. Srini joined Nordson in 2006 and has served in roles of increasing responsibility in corporate development, business management, and global market development. Srini was most recently Vice President of the Electronics Processing Solutions division where he is successfully driving the execution of the NBS Next growth framework.  Our new reporting structure will give better visibility into our medical and electronics platforms, which have grown significantly through both organic and acquisitive opportunities. I\u2019m also pleased that this structure gives us the opportunity to recognize and promote from within Nordson and advance our winning team strategy. We will share historic financials reflecting this new segmentation after the third quarter fiscal 2022 10-Q filing. Turning to Slide 10, I\u2019m pleased to highlight the new acquisition agreement that we announced earlier in August. Nordson has a very disciplined acquisition strategy. We\u2019re focused on acquiring businesses with differentiated precision technology that serve attractive high growth end market applications. We have been building platforms in two end markets that meet these strategic criteria : medical and test and inspection.  In the test and inspection platform, we have built a significant product offering for our electronic customers in X-ray and acoustic inspection. Using the NBS Next growth framework, the test and inspection division identified optical inspection as a high growth application in this end market. Further, our deep understanding of the semiconductor customer and industry trends indicates that the 3D automated optical inspection product category is growing double digits.  Optical inspection, which takes a picture of the surface level of an application such as semiconductors or printed circuit boards is an efficient non-invasive inspection method. CyberOptics, which established itself as a leading global developer and manufacturer of high precision 3D optical sensing technology solutions provides a new growth platform for us with existing and new customers in the electronics end market.  CyberOptics utilizes a proprietary sensor technology called MRS that significantly reduces reflection to create higher quality 3D image in diverse electronics applications. The innovative CyberOptics sensors combined with advanced software results in high quality images at market-leading speed, precision and resolution.  The company also has introduced WaferSense technology, which is a wireless diagnostic tool that provides real time data to ensure the calibration and process reliability of wafer production systems. Today this type of inspection requires machines to go offline, so WaferSense offers in-line diagnostic inspection that will improve a customer\u2019s product quality and throughput efficiency. This technology will allow Nordson to further expand into the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process where Nordson has limited presence today. We are very excited to soon add CyberOptics\u2019 differentiated technology into Nordson\u2019s portfolio. This acquisition meets the strategic and financial expectations we outlined during our investor day in March 2021. We expect this deal to close in our first quarter of fiscal 2023. We will invest in this business to extend the technology to meet emerging customer needs and scale their global sales and service infrastructure to make their technology accessible to a broader range of electronics customers. Now let\u2019s turn to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook on Slide 11. Order entry remained strong throughout the third quarter with a favorable book-to-bill ratio maintaining backlog at over $1 billion. This growth in backlog is partially related to the ongoing extended shipment request dates for large customer orders in electronics, industrial and medical end markets. For the full year fiscal 2022, we are confirming our previously provided revenue guidance of 8% to 9% growth and adjusted earnings growth in the range of 18% to 21% over fiscal 2021, despite the increased currency headwinds. This is approximately 20% earnings growth following a record 2021 financial performance. It is a testament to our dedicated employees and the solid execution of the SN strategy.  Our financial results and expectations for profitable growth is rooted in our differentiated precision technology, customer-centric model, and diversified end markets. Additionally, the ongoing implementation of NBS Next is making sure that we have a crystal clear view of our best growth opportunities and we remain disproportionately invested in them during this dynamic environment. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : \u2026and your results certainly about that trend in your commentary about strength in end markets certainly there. Any differences that you\u2019re seeing, maybe some of your earlier cycle order entry filling, just any dynamics that you\u2019re seeing that maybe you are raising some red flags in your head? And I guess in line with that, how do you view this portfolio now that you\u2019ve built through cycles? It seems much significantly more defensible as we go forward here with particularly strength in that medical and some of the technology businesses, so just any thoughts there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Allison, we missed the earlier part of the question. If you don\u2019t mind, could you repeat it? Maybe I missed it. Allison Poliniak : Yes, I would say just any red flags that you\u2019re starting to see. I know you talked to order entry being pretty strong still, but just any sort of normalization or slowing or some cautiousness around some of your customers that are out there today? Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. In general, as we indicated and our results show, it was a very broad-based demand environment that we are experiencing today, and points of strength, as we indicated, electronics, medical. We also saw some really good strength and solid order entry, as well as revenue profiles in our industrial businesses, and our consumer-facing businesses in North America were particularly strong as well.  As you think about orders, our comps are beginning to get difficult, right? If anything, that\u2019s probably what you would see, but in general very solid in electronics, very solid in medical, pretty good strength in industrial, so. Joseph Kelley : I would just - in the quarter, our order entry from a strength standpoint was again a favorable book-to-bill, so that\u2019s the seventh consecutive quarter where we\u2019ve been adding to backlog. So despite the record sales, order entry was north of our sales. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then the new segment structure that you put out there, I just recall ATS kind of before that push into medical was extremely volatile. How should we think of that volatility in ATS today? Is that test and inspection balancing some of that volatility that you\u2019ve historically seen there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. If you think about our electronics business, and we\u2019ve talked about this now for some time here, our electronics dispense business as such has gotten more broader and more diverse in the applications, as well as test and inspection is less volatile when compared to dispense and hence what you find really is less cyclical than before, but it is still a tech-facing business, it still has some cyclicality, might be amplitude of the cycles being muted is our expectation. Allison Poliniak : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Connor Lynagh. Your line is open. Connor Lynagh : Yes, thank you. I was wondering if we could dive in on the CyberOptics acquisition a little bit more. Could you maybe discuss the competitive positioning of the company, sort of why you found it to be an attractive target? And then the second portion of this, if you could just detail some of the cost synergies. It seems like that was a meaningful portion of the deal. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, if you think about CyberOptics, CyberOptics is a leading global design developer of 3D optical inspection. And the reason we call that out as 3D optical inspection is that they have some unique technology around something called MRS, which is really -- which suppresses the reflection coming off of shiny surfaces. So what you find really is they are really strong in this and that leads to highly precise at greater speeds of 3D images than their competitors. So their competitor advantage really is on speed, precision and resolution. What we find is, they\u2019re about a $100 million company in a market space about $1 billion, so we felt or we believe that there is an opportunity here for us to continue to expand their wonderful technology into existing customers of Nordson and use our global infrastructure to be able to gain share in the marketplace and certainly continue to solve problems for our existing customers. So from our perspective, it is -- the 3D inspection is a double-digit growing part of test and inspection technology, so a much faster growth rate that our existing test and inspection technologies, which are still growing nicely at high single digits, but 3D optical inspection is growing at double digits. So really like the growth rate, really like the technology, really like the market position and hence the combination of CyberOptics\u2019 technology with Nordson\u2019s market presence and commercial infrastructure, believe that this is a really good addition to our portfolio. And Joe, do you want to take the question on synergies? Joseph Kelley : Yes. Thank you, Naga. Yes, so when you think about the $6 million of cost synergies, I would tell you there\u2019s two main buckets. One is greater than 50% of those cost synergies are simply eliminating the public company costs. As you\u2019re aware, CyberOptics is a public company, and so there\u2019s some cost synergies there that are north of 50% of the total. The other one I would tell you is, when you look at Nordson\u2019s global sales infrastructure, there\u2019s opportunity there to leverage our physical infrastructure around the world to more efficiently support their existing sales force and start to leverage their presence in other geographies, and that\u2019s the remainder I would tell you of the $6 million cost synergies. Sundaram Nagarajan : I\u2019d add one more thing on CyberOptics, and it is an important piece of why we have decided to go this route, is that the technology of CyberOptics is exceptional in our mind, and we intend to continue to invest in this technology to meet emerging customer needs. And so yes, we have the synergies, but it\u2019s also equally important to remember that this is the reason we acquired CyberOptics, is really to invest in the technology and support the growth that they have experienced, which is incredibly good compared to their peers. Connor Lynagh : Makes sense, thank you. I was wondering, just broadly speaking within this value chain, are there any other areas that you see as particularly high growth, particularly compelling for further capital allocation? Sundaram Nagarajan : You know, there are a number of other opportunities out there that we continue to evaluate, so the opportunity pipeline looks pretty good. But in terms of this area, traditionally we have spent most of our time in the back end of the semiconductor manufacturing and also we\u2019ve spent more time in components, as well as PCBs. What CyberOptics brings us is more exposure to the front end where we have limited opportunities, and so the front to middle part of semiconductor manufacturing still is an area where Nordson\u2019s capabilities align yet our presence is limited, so we do see opportunities there. Connor Lynagh : All right, thanks very much. I\u2019ll turn it back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thank you, good morning. Congrats on the deal. Was curious on the longer cycle side of the business, you mentioned industrial markets along with electronics and medical, but in the industrial markets with the long lead time, large orders, I\u2019m curious if you could kind of differentiate among your industrial end markets, where you\u2019re seeing those long lead time, larger orders land. Sundaram Nagarajan : If you think about our industrial coatings business, this is just one of those businesses where we have pretty--we have customers placing orders much into 2023, right, and so really we find--and it\u2019s not only our industrial but they\u2019re also consumer-facing, for example our container coating business is doing really well and the backlog is pretty strong as we look forward into 2023, we see some pretty good strength. Similarly what you\u2019re--on a broader basis, this is a trend that has been talked about but continues to emerge, which we see some strength in the U.S., is that as our customers think about supply chain constraints and as they begin to re-shore manufacturing to more regional places, we do see opportunities for our industrial businesses to continue to have strength and opportunities to grow. You know, our newly acquired NDC Technologies, which we call it as the mission control systems business within Nordson, is also seeing some pretty good strength. Here, just as a reminder, what we manufacture here are sensors or sensing technologies that go on automated lines of manufacturing, so if you\u2019re in the food and beverage industry, our sensors detect and ensure that the chip, for example, has the right crispness, and if you are in a film cast line, it measures the thickness of the film to make sure that high quality film is produced.  Again, our sensor technologies aiding automation, another secular trend that we are very excited, that positions Nordson to continue to grow. Christopher Glynn : Great, thanks. Just wanted to touch on the short cycle industrial space - you know, how you\u2019re seeing the continuity there, particularly on some of the consumables, the OEM content that you sell. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. If you think about our OEM consumer-facing businesses, especially in our adhesive business, we have new applications that we\u2019re very excited about. In electric vehicles, we\u2019re starting to gain some traction there. Electric vehicle battery manufacturing is not completely solidified yet, but the number of emerging applications that are very beneficial to Nordson\u2019s hot melt adhesive and other technologies, so very excited about that. On consumer packaging, interestingly enough, in North America our businesses continue to have pretty good strength. In Europe as well, we seem to have good strength, but in Europe it gets muted by the currency headwinds that we are facing right now. Christopher Glynn : Thanks for all the color. Joseph Kelley : Yes, if I could just add a little color in number terms - I mean, if you look at our growth rate in the United States, it was up organically 5%, which is accelerating from our year-to-date growth rate in that business. Christopher Glynn : Got you, thanks Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning Jeff. Joseph Kelley : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Just back on the order front, any indications you\u2019re getting from customers that they\u2019re going to start to kind of normalize the order patterns and kind of get away from this less long dated focus, or is that continuing to play out? Then just separately, I think Naga, you said electronics still very strong, but we\u2019ve gotten a lot of mixed messages on semi capex, and just wondering how you\u2019re kind of looking behind the scenes to understand any cracks there. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, so let me take the electronics question first and then we\u2019ll talk about that.  In terms of electronics, what you\u2019re beginning to find is that based on what we see with our customers, our sales model, which is a direct sales model so we have direct interactions with our--customers don\u2019t have distributors in between, the order entry still looks pretty solid and still continues to be robust for our teams, both in the dispense side of the business as well as in test and inspection.  The thing to remember is something that has changed about electronics and digital businesses is that now electronics is just not limited to consumer goods, right? Electronics is much broader, a bigger part--a significantly bigger part of how people conduct business. Think about the explosion in cloud, think about number of different technologies now have become a common part of doing business, be it a Zoom call or a Teams call. All of this has digital infrastructure behind it that needs to continue to be supported, so. Our teams find that our electronics businesses and the need for electronics in this digital economy is much more broader than it ever has been, and so that might be part of the explanation why we continue to see strength in electronics for a longer period than before - that is one, and the second is the complexity of these devices, semiconductors, there is a lot of work going on to ensure throughput and quality of these devices, and hence we see our test and inspection businesses benefit from this trend about--you know, not quite 100% but pretty darn close to more in line examination and inspection than offline sampling, so you see that benefit. From an electronics business, from what we can see, what we have visibility to do, and we do have a lot of visibility because of our direct sales model, we feel really good about where the business is at today. In terms of our customers and order pattern changing, we have not seen it normalize yet, that people are coming back now. In the past, we used to have backlog for a quarter ahead, but now we have several quarters in front of us, right, and I think unless--at least, this is just my personal perspective, as we resolve supply chain issues and people feel more confident about our supply chain, not just Nordson\u2019s supply chain but global supply chain, this is not going to change, so until we have that, it is going to be this long dated orders is just people feeling I need to get my orders in line so that my project, which is going to come online in a year from now, doesn\u2019t get delayed.  You know, I wish I could give you a more clear answer, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We continue to see our customers keep the same pattern that we have seen in the last four to six quarters, that still are reflected in this large backlog we have, and I have not seen it normalize yet. Jeff Hammond : No, that\u2019s great color. Then just maybe a preview on the segment change, any light you can shed on rough--I don\u2019t know if the business is ex-CyberOptics or going to be 50/50 between medical and electronics, or--you know, kind of size those, and should we expect a material difference in the margin profile or the growth profile of those businesses? Joseph Kelley : Yes, shortly after filing our 10-Q, we\u2019re going to issue a press release which will give you all the historical information financially for the new segments, going back quarterly 2019, \u201920 and \u201921, so [indiscernible] will be in that release. Jeff Hammond : Okay, and then just a housekeeping, corporate expense was a little bit higher. How should we think about that run rate into 4Q? Joseph Kelley : Yes, I would just take and think about the [indiscernible] average in corporate expense on a quarterly basis is the run rate. That\u2019s how I would think about that. Jeff Hammond : Okay, thanks so much. Joseph Kelley : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks, good morning. Just building on the last question on the new reporting structure, can you just talk through how you are thinking about the independent long term growth outlook for the medical and fluids business and then ATS, and then how should we think about incremental margins on the separate businesses? Joseph Kelley : Yes, so kind of like we highlighted at our investor day, when you think about the medical business and the long term growth rate there, if that was your question, Saree, that has, I think, a higher growth rate given the mega trends in that market and the applications with which we serve, and so that\u2019s slightly higher than our ATS business and the new segmentation, which is predominantly on the electronics side. I would tell you it\u2019s probably about 200 basis points higher in terms of growth rate in the medical. Then as it relates to incremental margins, as you\u2019re aware on organic growth, we have committed to 40% to 45% incremental margins on our organic growth, and you see that a little bit higher in the IPS segment over the recent quarters, past several quarters, but going forward, I would commit to the 40% to 45% in all three of our segments. Saree Boroditsky : Great, thank you, and then you mentioned a facility closure in the quarter, I think in ATS. Would you expect to see a margin benefit from this closure, and could you quantify that for us? Joseph Kelley : Yes, the margin benefit as we consolidate that facility, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a material change in that. It\u2019s predominantly to support the growth and supporting that growth at the incremental margins of 40% to 45%, so I would tell you as kind of a capacity play as we consolidate it into and expanded an existing facility and consolidate it from a separate facility. Saree Boroditsky : Great, and if I could just squeeze one more in, I think your earnings guidance still has kind of a wide range for the fourth quarter. Could you just talk through the assumptions at the bottom and top end of the range, and what would you need to see to hit the higher or lower end? Thank you. Joseph Kelley : You bet. Yes, so when you think about our Q4 2022 guidance, first of all, I would tell you maintaining the guidance range suggests an increase in the organic growth forecast, given the fact that FX was a greater headwind than it was when we initially gave the guidance, and so when you think about Q4, our guidance at the midpoint suggests about 10% sales growth and about a 20% earnings growth, and so considering the 5% FX headwind, that\u2019s about a 15% constant currency growth rate in Q4. Saree, to answer your question, on the lower side, who knows where the exchange rates are going to move. There was some volatility, as you saw in Q3, and that has continued in Q4, and then I would tell you there\u2019s just some overall, I would say, uncertainty in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s geopolitical, if you look at the COVID lockdowns that we experienced in Q3 in Shanghai and if that will have any recurring impact in Q4, we don\u2019t know, and so it\u2019s just the overall, I would tell you, volatility of the supply chain which continues to be a challenge as well as currency, which kind of has us maintaining the lower end of the range. If you look at the upper portion of our guidance range, it kind of suggests that Q4 from a sales standpoint should be comparable to Q3 at the record level $662 million, and then as we also look at the upper end of our guidance range from an earnings perspective, it suggests, let\u2019s just say 23% growth, however sequentially the earnings is down from Q3, and I would tell you there\u2019s two main factors that we\u2019re taking into consideration there. One is IPS sales mix is expected to be less favorable in Q4 given the composition of the backlog and items scheduled to ship. This sequentially has a negative impact on profitability when you compare it to Q3 specifically. Then secondly, the stronger U.S. dollar - I mean, with the euro at near parity or below for the forecast for Q4 compared to where it was in Q3, this again has a negative impact on earnings when you look sequentially compared to Q3.  Those are some of the thoughts that went into our guidance, maintaining our guidance, which is really increasing our organic growth forecast. Saree Boroditsky : Great, I really appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Pez: Hey, good morning everybody. This is Pez [ph] on for Mike. Joseph Kelley : Hi Pez. Pez: Wanted to dig into the backlog a little bit. Just wanted to clarify - I believe you said backlog was up sequentially based on the commentary, and then also mentioned continuing to see the extended shipment dates. Previously they were booking several quarters out. Is that extending, is that shortening, is it about the same?  Then also, could you maybe discuss the composition of backlog, maybe how that\u2019s changed quarter-over-quarter? Joseph Kelley : Yes, just specifically, order entry exceeded our sales, so it was very slight but it was an increase in our backlog, and so it remains north of $1 billion. I would tell you it\u2019s basically maintaining the timeline that we saw in Q2 in terms of getting in line order entry and backlog. It\u2019s predominantly, I would say disproportionately heavily weighted on the systems side where the longer lead times are. Some of our parts and consumables are more book and ship, as you know, and so there\u2019s not a heavy backlog there; but when you look at some of our systems businesses, it\u2019s going out, as Naga mentioned, into \u201923. Your question, has it changed? It has--that dynamic hasn\u2019t changed from Q2 to Q3. It remains the same, I would tell you. Pez: Then could you maybe discuss how that\u2019s changed your visibility going into F2023? Obviously backlog is elevated versus prior years going into--sorry, calendar 2023, obviously backlog is elevated going into next year relative to prior years. Does that give you a little bit more comfort in the strength for the--excuse me, the sales conversion in the front half of next year, and does that give you a little bit more visibility on the front half? Joseph Kelley : Yes, I would tell you for the systems business, yes, it does give us better visibility. Think how we used to run with a $400 million backlog, and now we\u2019re running with a backlog of $1 billion. Clearly the heavy systems businesses, there\u2019s greater visibility, but I\u2019d also tell you in some of our medical businesses, there\u2019s better visibility than there used to be in the past, so that does, I would tell you, help us in terms of our forecasting accuracy. That being said, there is a large portion of our business which remains with a shorter cycle time of book and ship, and so it\u2019s not even across the board, like I said earlier. Pez: Great, thank you. That\u2019s all helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Joseph Kelley : Thanks Pez. Operator : Again if you would like to ask a question, press star and then the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Hey, morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. I guess Naga, you\u2019ve given us some really great color on CyberOptics and just some of the unique capabilities there, but I guess wafer level test inspection, it\u2019s a much more competitive space than some of the back end niche stuff that Nordson\u2019s been doing historically. Is it because of the unique capabilities that we moved into this, or is there really an impetus to move further into the wafer-level inspection and kind of get into that space in a much more meaningful way, and how should we think about the TAM for T&I following this deal? Sundaram Nagarajan : You know, if you just think about just the TAM for CyberOptics itself, it\u2019s about $1.3 billion. There are two things very unique about CyberOptics. The 3D inspection is something that Nordson does not have, right? We have a small optical business, but really we buy CyberOptics MRS sensor to make 3D inspection happen for us, so really we\u2019re already a customer of CyberOptics so we understand the capabilities of CyberOptics\u2019 technology.  Wafer-level inspection is a great opportunity, but in some of the wafer-level opportunity for CyberOptics really, they sell the critical component, which is the MRS sensor, to their customers who build the broader system, right, so it kind of resembles some of our other businesses where we sell the critical component into a major machine that one of CyberOptics\u2019 customers markets, right, so that\u2019s an example of it.  Our interest in this business is that CyberOptics also sells 3D inspection systems in the back end. It is not just exclusively to the front end, right? The reason we highlight front end is that because we already do back end and middle end, we don\u2019t do the front end, that\u2019s really what we were trying to do, so it is not about that we want to move exclusively into front end or greater opportunities in front end, it is just and what we do in the back end, right, so that\u2019s sort of how I think about it. The other exciting technology that CyberOptics brings to Nordson is very different, which is their WaferSense technology, which is an online monitoring of manufacturing systems in wafer production. That is completely new for us, and I think that again puts us in a place where it\u2019s a small device but performs a very critical function, adds a lot of value, so two exciting technologies we bring with the company, continue to expand our test and inspection portfolio, and all rooted in this secular trend of things becoming smaller, things becoming more complex, and hence test and inspection becoming more in line, more 100% rather than sampling, so a good secular trend for us and adding more capability.  You know, optical is--one more thing on optical inspection is that optical inspection is viewed as something that doesn\u2019t impact the component it\u2019s inspecting, so you think about our X-ray inspection, it impacts not the first time but after the tenth time, it would impact the component it is inspecting, but optical inspection, that does not happen, so inherently optical inspection continues to grow as an inspection method and we wanted to make sure that we have a presence in that space. Chris Dankert : Got you, thank you Naga. That\u2019s very helpful color. It sounds like you are really picking your spots in that front end space, so thank you. I guess by way of follow-up, and again know we\u2019re not talking about fiscal \u201923 yet, but just given the size of the backlog, is there any lumpiness to keep in mind as we\u2019re shaping and building out the out year here? Joseph Kelley : Yes, I would tell you if you look at our guidance for Q4 and what we just delivered in Q3, different than last year in the back half when you saw lumpiness in terms of our Q3 performance versus our Q4. It\u2019s really starting to, I would say, level out. You also saw that in our strong Q1 compared to historically lighter Q1s if you go back several years, so from a lumpiness, I would tell you it\u2019s started to level out as opposed to increase. There\u2019s one other point I\u2019d like to make as a little bit of follow-up on Saree\u2019s question on our Q4 guidance and properly interpreting our Q3 results. When you look at Q3 profitability by segment, there were changes in inventory valuation related to switching from LIFO method to FIFO method and obsoleting older product lines. The net impact of the adjustment was immaterial to the consolidated Nordson results in the quarter, but when looking specifically at the segment profitability in Q3 2022, these adjustments favorably impacted IPS and unfavorably impacted ATS by about 100 basis points, so when thinking about our Q3 performance and forecasting into Q4, I think that\u2019s important to understand despite the fact it was immaterial to the consolidated Nordson. Chris Dankert : That\u2019s really helpful, Joe. Thank you so much for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just two quick questions. First, can you comment on where Nordson stands right now price versus cost, and then maybe just a quick word on the M&A pipeline beyond CyberOptics, comment on go-forward actionability, what the funnel looks like, multiples you\u2019re seeing. Thank you. Joseph Kelley : Yes, maybe Naga, I\u2019ll take the price versus cost - again, it was favorable in terms of we were successful in passing through the cost increase in terms of pricing, but it was negative impact from a margin standpoint because it\u2019s not like remaining cost increase plus 56% on top of it, it was simply favorable from a pass through standpoint. Sundaram Nagarajan : In terms of our pipeline, it continues to be very active, continues to be pretty strong. We have a very disciplined acquisition strategy, very focused strategically around our medical businesses and our test and inspection businesses. Clearly if we find a core technology that is adjacent to what we do, we certainly will take a look at it, but we remain focused on medical and test and inspection. The pipeline itself is pretty good. Actionability - you know, it is very difficult to say. Given the kind of volatility, it seems that it\u2019s difficult to predict, so I wouldn\u2019t comment much about the actionability other than we continue to cultivate our pipeline, continue to--and CyberOptics was a great example, right? We had known CyberOptics for a number of years, we just had a nice opportunity to take that opportunity and convert it to--you know, get to a place where we were able to have an agreement, so. Actionability depends, is the best way I could say it, but we are very pleased with the strength of the pipeline and the activity we have got going on. On valuation, in some areas we have, at least public equities, look like they\u2019ve moderated, but we are playing in highly differentiated businesses, highly differentiated end markets as well as technologies. We expect to pay market multiples, but we\u2019re going to be highly disciplined on our financial return metrics, and so hopefully our last two deals that we have announced, NDC as well CyberOptics, are a good indicator of entering markets where it is very strategic to us and has a great opportunity for us to grow the company while at the same time being financially disciplined. Matt Summerville : Got it, thank you guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Naga, I turn the call back over to you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Our continued performance reflects the strength of our differentiated precision technology, customer-centric model, and diversified end markets. Again, I want to thank Nordson\u2019s employees for their perseverance and commitment which makes these results possible. The continued deployment of NBS Next and the Ascend strategy will ensure we remain well positioned in this dynamic environment. Thank you for your time and attention on today\u2019s call. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Moving to today\u2019s agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss fourth quarter and full year highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. Joe also will talk about the year-end balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will conclude with a high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including an update on the Ascend strategy as well as our fiscal 2023 first quarter and full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I\u2019ll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson\u2019s fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year conference call.  As I reflect on the past few years and in particular 2022, the Nordson team managed through supply chain constraints, inflation at a 40-year high, increasing currency pressures, labor challenges, and COVID-19 shutdowns, and yet we have achieved a second consecutive year of record results in fiscal 2022. I want to thank our incredible employees who have remained focused on our customers and successfully leveraged our NBS Next growth framework to prioritize their time, efforts and resources on the best growth opportunities during the year. We finished 2022 with a strong fourth quarter performance and carry momentum into 2023 related to the holistic deployment of NBS Next and our Ascend strategy. This is critical as we enter 2023. The environment will likely be as full of macro changes and challenges as the last two years.  I\u2019ll speak more to this in a few moments, but I will now turn the call over to Joe to provide more detailed perspectives on our financial results for this quarter and fiscal 2022. Joe Kelley : Thank you Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide No. 5, you\u2019ll see fourth quarter 2022 sales were $684 million, an increase of 14% compared to fourth quarter sales of $599 million. The increase was primarily related to 18% organic growth plus the NDC acquisition, offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 8%.  The 18% organic sales increase was driven by solid 14% volume growth and approximately 4% in pricing as we passed through cost inflation. The growth was in all geographies and most product lines with particularly strong demand in polymer processing, electronics and medical, and headwinds resulted from the U.S. dollar strengthening against the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese yuan during the fourth quarter. Early here in fiscal 2023, some of this increased pressure has subsided, moving back closer to the third quarter levels when the year-over-year currency impact on sales was unfavorable 5%. Gross profits increased 10% over the prior year to $363 million or 53% of sales compared to $331 million or 55% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. The double-digit growth in profit dollars was driven by the strong sales growth while the year-over-year margin decrease of 200 basis points was influenced by several factors. Most significant was the passing through of cost inflation which, while relatively neutral from a gross profit dollar perspective, diluted the margins approximately 140 basis points. Additionally, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar pressures the margins of our businesses that have U.S. dollar-denominated manufacturing costs and sell denominated in euros or other foreign currencies. These two factors contributed to the 200 basis point decline in margin percent while delivering a significant 17% constant currency growth in gross profit dollars. Operating profit was $178 million in the quarter or 26% of sales, as 17% increase from the prior year. Strong double-digit organic sales growth at attractive incremental margins more than offset the 10% unfavorable year-over-year currency impact on operating profit. Consolidated Nordson organic incremental operating profit margin inclusive of the currency changes was 43% in the quarter. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $202 million or 30% of sales.  Looking at non-operating expenses, other net expenses decreased $12 million year-over-year, relatively evenly split between lower non-operating pension costs and increased foreign currency exchange gains. The lower non-operating pension costs are sustainable heading into 2023 while the currency exchange gains resulted from the significant currency fluctuations in the quarter and are not likely to repeat. Tax expense was $36 million for an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter, slightly below the full year and forecasted rate of 21%.  Net income in the quarter totaled $141 million or $2.44 per share, representing a 28% increase from the prior year earnings. This improvement is reflective of the 14% year-over-year increase in sales and, more importantly, consistent application of the NBS Next growth framework which leads to steady profitable growth with attractive incremental margins. Turning to Slide 6, I will now share a few comments on our full year results.  Sales for fiscal year 2022 were a record $2.6 billion, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year\u2019s record sales result. This change in sales included an organic increase of 11%, a 3% increase primarily from the NDC acquisition. This growth was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 4%.  Also a company record, adjusted operating profit was $707 million or 27% of sales, which reflects a 15% increase over the prior year, or on a constant currency basis growth of 21%. Organic incremental operating profit margins on the year were 55%, which is above the targeted range of 40% to 45%.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $9.43, a 22% increase from the prior year, and EBITDA for the full year increased to $807 million or 31% of sales. Now let\u2019s turn to Slides 7 through 9 to review the fourth quarter 2022 segment performance. Industrial precision solution sales of $356 million increased 13% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was 16% and the NDC acquisition added 7%. This growth was offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 10%. Robust demand in the polymer processing product line plus steady growth in industrial coating products and packaging product lines in the food and beverage industry, as well as the industrial end markets, drove this quarter\u2019s results. All major geographies contributed to the quarter\u2019s growth. Operating profit for the quarter was $110 million or 31% of sales, which is an increase of 8% compared to the prior year operating profit of $103 million. This growth was driven primarily by leveraging organic sales growth at incremental margins of 43% plus the benefit of the NDC acquisition. Medical and fluid solution sales of $181 million increased 11% compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. This change included an increase in organic sales volume of 15% and a 4% decrease related to unfavorable currency impacts. Growth was across all product lines with robust growth in the biopharma fluid component product line. All geographies contributed to this quarter\u2019s growth with particular strength in the Americas. Fourth quarter operating profit was $52 million or 29% of sales, which is an increase of 2% compared to the prior year operating profit of $51 million. This growth was driven by sales volume leverage offset by manufacturing inefficiencies following the third quarter factory consolidation within the fluid dispense division. These challenges should be temporary in nature as the consolidated factory ramps to targeted production levels and efficiency. Turning to Slide 9, we will see advanced technology solution sales of $147 million increased 21% compared to the prior year\u2019s fourth quarter. This change included an increase in organic sales of 28% offset by a 7% decrease related to unfavorable currency impacts. This segment had double digit growth in both the test and inspection and electronics dispense product lines, serving predominantly the semiconductor and electronics end markets. All geographies contributed to this quarter\u2019s growth. Fourth quarter operating profit increased $21 million or 131% from the prior year to $38 million or 26% of sales in the quarter. The growth was driven by sales volume leverage and realization of benefits from cost control measures taken in the prior year. Deployment of our NBS Next growth framework continues to be a key element in the success of this segment delivering profitable growth. Finally turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 10, through our disciplined approach to capital deployment, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and abundant borrowing capacity. Cash totaled $163 million and net debt was $574 million, resulting in a 0.7 times leverage based on a trailing 12 months EBITDA.  Free cash flow in the quarter was $161 million, which brings the full year 2022 free cash flow total to $462 million or a conversion rate on net income of 90%. This conversion rate was below the normal target of 100% because of strategic investments being made in inventory throughout the year to address supply chain constraints and support the backlog. Dividend payments were $37 million in the quarter, reflective of the 27% increase in the annual dividend that our board approved during the quarter. Also, with the ongoing market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunistic repurchase of shares within the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total spent in share repurchases to over $260 million at an average repurchase price of $219 per share. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 2023 assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22% and capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million, with minimal cash pension contributions given the pension annuitization that took place earlier this year.  In summary, fourth quarter 2022 was a very strong finish to a record fiscal 2022 performance. All three segments contributed both sales growth and operating profit growth in the quarter. Consolidated revenue growth of 14% despite an 8% currency headwind and delivering 43% incremental margins on the organic growth evidences our NBS Next growth framework delivering results. This makes for the second consecutive year of delivering record annual sales and earnings. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you Joe. Again, thank you to the Nordson team for another strong year. I want to re-emphasize Joe\u2019s comments - we achieved record results with all segments contributing to both sales growth and operating profit growth for the quarter and year. That\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Beyond the financial results, I\u2019m very pleased with our steady deployment of the NBS Next growth framework. NBS Next has evolved from an aspiration to a working model within the business. This data driven segmentation framework drives choices, focus and simplification. We now have two divisions that have achieved market leading business performance. They use the framework as a competitive advantage to deliver on time quality products to their top customers, winning the business and growing market share. Leaders from these divisions are now sharing their lessons learned internally by hosting facility tours and teaching at our Nordson accelerated training programs.  Earlier this month, I visited several sites in Europe and I\u2019m excited by the progress I observed. The questions that were asked as well as the progress that was shared during the manufacturing facility tours clearly demonstrates the engagement and adoption of the framework as the way we do business. NBS Next is becoming a competitive advantage for Nordson moving into 2023 and beyond. This new capability combined with the core elements of the Nordson business model has positioned us to deliver results through more challenging economic demand environments.  First among the core elements of Nordson\u2019s business model is the fundamental focus on our customers. Our intimate customer relationships allow us to add value by solving critical customer problems, whether that is enabling their new product ideas or helping them operate more efficiently. This customer partnership has been further strengthened over the past two years as we worked through numerous challenges to consistently deliver quality product. Second is the diversity of our business from both a geographic and end market perspective. For example, in fiscal 2022 we overcame the shutdown of our Shanghai, China IPS facility as a result of our strength in other regions. We also serve a wide variety of end markets including consumer non-durables, medical, electronics, industrial and more. Within these end markets, we are diversified; for example, a quarter of our medical platform is the fluid component solutions used in biopharmaceutical applications, while the remaining is our interventional solutions that includes catheters, cannulas and medical balloons. In addition, our electronics applications are split between dispense applications and more secular test and inspection processes. This diversification makes us largely recession resilient or able to withstand the ebbs and flows of individual end market applications or geographies which may be more cyclical or volatile in any given period.  Finally, the third core element of our business model is the recurring revenue. Over 50% of our sales mix is aftermarket parts and consumables, which has been proven to sustain our business even in down periods. These core elements position our base business to perform well during periods of economic uncertainty. In addition, the execution of a disciplined M&A strategy continues to strengthen our position technology platforms.  The NDC measurement and control division which we acquired in November of 2021 is integrating well and contributed nicely to the fiscal 2022 performance. Recently we closed the CyberOptics acquisition which expands our applications in the optical test and inspection end market. We are excited about the opportunities we see in that space. Turning now to the outlook on Slide 12, we enter fiscal 2023 with approximately $1 billion in backlog, inclusive of the acquired CyberOptics backlog. The book-to-bill in the fourth quarter of 2022 was slightly unfavorable and the year-over-year currency headwinds are significant, as evidenced in our fiscal fourth quarter results. Based on the combination of order entry, backlog, customer delivery timing requests and current foreign currency exchange rates, we anticipate delivering sales growth in the range of 1% to 7% above the record fiscal 2022. This includes an estimated 2% currency headwind. Full year earnings are forecasted in the range of $8.75 to $10.10 per share. This full-year guidance assumes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 3% on the earnings, the increased interest rate environment, and contemplates some demand uncertainty related to the back half of 2023. As you will see on Slide 13, the first quarter 2023 sales are forecasted in the range of $605 million to $630 million and adjusted earnings in the range of $1.85 to $2 per diluted share. Included in the forecasted guidance are the unfavorable currency impacts of approximately 4% on sales and 7% on earnings.  Again, I want to thank our employees, customers and shareholders for your continued support. We will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Matt Summerville : Thanks. A couple questions. First Naga and Joe, can you maybe talk about the order cadence you saw over the course of fiscal Q4 and what you\u2019ve seen thus far in the fiscal \u201923? Maybe talk about some of the pluses and minuses you\u2019re seeing across the business and how that informs your view on what you\u2019re calling a bit of an uncertain second half in the fiscal year, and then I have a follow-up. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, thank you Matt. A couple of things. Let\u2019s go by our major end markets. If you think about ATS, the backlog is pretty strong going into Q1 and first half. For the full year, we expect single digit organic growth for the year. Both T&I--you know, both our test and inspection and our dispense business are expected to grow in the year. If you look at our industrial business, or IPS, end markets remain solid. A couple of our system businesses are expected to deliver and are expected to grow double digits, while our consumer non-durables are expected to sustain their current record levels. If you think about MFS, our forecast is again this segment is also expected to grow in single digits. What you see is our interventional components, the medical fluid components, if you think about the interventional side, which is our balloons and catheters, this business is returning back to pre-COVID levels of high single digit growth. Our fluid components, which is approximately 20% of this business, had a great two years of double-digit growth, and what we understand, and we watch this end market with some caution as some of our customers have built up some excess inventory, but important to remember this is 20% of our MFS segment. Hopefully that gives you some color, and this is what is embedded in our guidance for the quarter and the year. Joe Kelley : Maybe Matt, I would just add-- Matt Summerville : I appreciate--sure? Joe Kelley : Yes, I\u2019d just add, as we said, as it trended throughout the year, we saw strong performance in \u201921, \u201922 - most of the quarters, we were running with a favorable book to bill, and in Q4 some of that started to moderate. The book to bill was slightly unfavorable. Matt Summerville : Understood. Maybe if you can just comment a little bit more on M&A, and even CyberOptics - you know, what are you incorporating into the guide as it relates to EPS accretion from CyberOptics, and what are you seeing looking forward in terms of actionability within your current M&A pipeline? Thank you. Joe Kelley : Maybe Naga, I\u2019ll handle the first part of that and you can take the second.  As it relates to CyberOptics, we are very pleased, everything is on track. Just a reminder, it\u2019s about a $100 million business, we\u2019re integrating it into our test and inspection division. We paid about 18.5 times EBITDA and as we execute synergies over the next year or so, we\u2019re going to take that to roughly 14.5 times EBITDA. Everything that we\u2019ve got in CyberOptics is what we expected and we\u2019re very pleased with it, and that\u2019s--. As it relates specifically to our guidance, what it will be, when you look at our full year guidance, the assumption is that that is slightly accretive for the full year. Sundaram Nagarajan : Joe, let me take the question around our acquisition pipeline. Maybe just as a reminder, Matt, we have clear strategic and financial criteria when we look at acquisition ideas and when we consummate deals, and just as a reminder, the strategic criteria really are we\u2019re looking for differentiated position technologies, we are looking for businesses that serve markets with high growth rates, certainly looking for businesses that have a customer-centric business model. On the financial side, we certainly look for businesses that have attractive growth rates and with Nordson-like gross margins, EBITDA margins around 20% with a clear path with expansion opportunities and an ROIC that is ahead of our cost of capital in five to seven years. That\u2019s really sort of our--that\u2019s what informs what deals we pursue and what we consummate finally. Our focus still remains on scaling our medical and test and inspection platforms. We certainly will look at adjacent position technologies if they meet our strategic and financial criteria.  Having provided you that background, our pipeline is pretty healthy. We are pursuing a number of different opportunities. Certainly we\u2019ll act on them thoughtfully based on our strategic and financial criteria - that\u2019s really important to remember. We are confident in our ability to deliver on $500 million of acquisitions, which is an important part of us reaching the $3 billion target we set for ourselves in 2021. Again, another reminder, we have acquired about $210 million worth of acquisitions towards that $500 million already, right - we did NDC, CyberOptics and Fluortek, and all of that gives us about $210 million. One other thing I would comment, through what we have done thus far, we have now been opened to many types of deals - for example, CyberOptics was a public company deal, NDC was a carve-out from a public company in Europe, so we feel good about our pipeline. We will remain strategically and financially diligent and disciplined. Matt Summerville : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joe Kelley : Morning Mike. Mike Halloran : Maybe help me understand some of the comments you had about the seasonality through the year. Obviously the first answer to Matt\u2019s question was very helpful as far as how you\u2019re thinking about the various moving pieces and orders trends; but Naga, you highlighted that the guidance assumes uncertainty around what the second half looked like, so maybe you could talk a little bit about what the seasonal assumptions look like, how the front half compares and the back half compared to what normal seasonality looks like, and what\u2019s behind the uncertainty that you\u2019ve got embedded in the back half. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not prudent, I just want to make sure I understand where you guys are coming from. Joe Kelley : Sure, maybe again, Naga, I\u2019ll take the front half of that. Mike, if you think about our full year guide, basically the midpoint is 4% sales growth and flat earnings on the full year. The simple way to think about this is acquisitions are roughly 4%, so the organic growth is probably 2% to 3%, and this is offset by our assumption around unfavorable currency impacts. The organic growth is coming in at incremental margins of 40% to 45%. The CyberOptics acquisition, as I mentioned before, is slightly accretive, but what\u2019s embedded in the earnings guidance is there\u2019s a currency headwind of about 3%, so when you think about 1% in sales of currency headwind, it translates to roughly 1.3 to 1.5 headwind on the earnings line. Interest expense is driving an increase given the change in interest rates, plus this year we did benefit from some foreign currency hedge gains, so those are not forecasted to repeat, so that\u2019s about a $0.20 headwind or 2% headwind to earnings. That\u2019s the full year, kind of what we\u2019re thinking about. To your question on timing, we feel pretty good about our visibility into the first half of the year. We\u2019re entering with a billion-dollar backlog, so we see organic growth in the first half of the year of about 4% to 5% - this is following two consecutive years of double-digit organic growth. But when we look at the second half, our guidance assumes that the organic growth is actually relatively flat at the midpoint, and so--and that\u2019s just given our visibility. We have good visibility to the first half, I would tell you, given some of our backlog in systems orders, and limited visibility to the second half.  When you think about the first half, it\u2019s actually not evenly split between Q1 and Q2. Your have Chinese New Year last year fell in Q2; this year, it falls into Q1, plus as you know, our systems business has grown nicely and so with that backlog, when we look at the scheduled customer system delivery dates, Q2 will be much stronger than Q3. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. When you think about FX, the FX headwind is going to be heavier in Q1 and Q2 at about 4% to 5% unfavorable on sales, where that will moderate to be relatively neutral in the back half provided we stay at forecasted exchange rates.  Hopefully that helps. Mike Halloran : No, that was great. To paraphrase quickly, first quarter you\u2019ve got some headwinds, second quarter you feel really good about the delivery schedule you see based on the backlog, but maybe some expectations for orders to be somewhat soft, you\u2019re just not sure what the environment look like, so the back half then, you\u2019ve got maybe below normal seasonality 2Q to 3Q and we\u2019ll just see how it plays out as we get closer to that date. Is that a fair, very quick interpretation? Joe Kelley : That\u2019s a fair interpretation, yes. The FX is a heavier impact in the first half then the second half, just given the way exchange rates have moved. That\u2019s a fair interpretation. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. Then the second and related piece is on the medical piece, you mentioned the inefficiencies. Could you maybe just help bucket out what kind of an impact that was in the quarter and then when you think the timing of that could get back towards what you think the more normal run rate for margins are in that segment? Joe Kelley : Yes Mike, so the reference there is to our MFS segment, which saw--you know, in the quarter had nice 15% growth and the operating profit grew, but it was negatively impacted, I would tell you, by approximately probably $5 million due to some manufacturing inefficiencies. This again was tied to the consolidation of the factories Q3, and so as we look into 2023, that factory as it ramps up to targeted efficiency levels and production levels, that will start to mitigate as we move throughout, I would tell you, the first half of \u201923. Mike Halloran : Great. Really appreciate the color, that was helpful. Thanks everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Naga and Joe, I want to go back to your comments around the moderating book to bill here. I know lead times have been extended on the order side. Are we seeing some normalization that\u2019s driving some of that as well, or are you seeing specific volatility in certain end markets or geographies? Just any thoughts there. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, if you think about our Q4 contribution and the full year contribution, it was fairly broad-based, all our business lines across all the three segments, and the same can be said for our geographies, so historic two years [indiscernible] organic growth going into [indiscernible].  As Joe said, we have good backlog, and we talked about by those different end markets, so in general we feel very strongly about first half, we have good visibility. I think second half, the best way I would tell you is our assumptions are it is a flat kind of organic growth, is really what we are assuming. Remember, this is flat on historic revenues in second half of 2022. Allison Poliniak : That\u2019s helpful. Then I know you talked about some timing of deliveries, you know, Q1 versus Q2, but was there any timing deliveries maybe that shifted into Q4 that could have been Q1? I know organic was maybe quite a bit stronger than we had anticipated. Just any thoughts there, thanks. Joe Kelley : Yes Allison, I would tell you Q4, particularly on the systems side, came in stronger than anticipated, and so there was a portion of that which you could contribute to timing, perhaps getting pulled into Q4 as opposed to Q1, so that does contribute a little bit to our guidance in Q1. Allison Poliniak : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Hammond from Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Jeff Hammond : Just on advanced tech, it sounds like great finish to the year, kind of in line-ish growth versus the rest. I\u2019m just wondering if you can parse out momentum in test and inspection versus electronics. Any softness around--you know, emerging softness around the consumer-related portions of your business or any of this China regulation noise, either on the core or on CyberOptics? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I think the way to think about this, our test and inspection business continues to have strong momentum coming into the year, and as we can see it, we feel good about our test and inspection business. We do see some moderation or book to bill that is unfavorable in our dispense side of the business, which has a portion of it is consumer-related, not all of it, because there is still semiconductor. But overall, we feel good that both these product lines will grow in the year and ATS as a segment would have single digit growth in the year, so feel good about that. First half, really good visibility, second half is a flattish kind of assumption. In terms of China regulation, Jeff, is one of the questions you asked, we don\u2019t see any significant impact that we know of today, so we don\u2019t really see that.  I know you had another piece there, Jeff, that I may have missed, if I didn\u2019t answer all of yours. Jeff Hammond : No, I think that covers it. Then just on the guide, maybe it\u2019s around macro uncertainty but the range is pretty wide, and maybe outside of the sales range, what are some of the other moving pieces that will inform maybe the wider range, and then if you can just give us an interest expense number so we can kind of fine-tune how to think about the increase there, that\u2019d be great. Thanks. Joe Kelley : Yes Jeff, maybe I\u2019ll take the interest expense first. I would think about that going from roughly $20 million to $40 million based on the interest rate movements and our average powering balances \u201922 to \u201923. As it relates to our guide in terms of the sales range, again I just would go back and share that we have pretty good visibility into Q1 and Q2, and so the first half, the organic growth for the first half is 4% to 5%. You can think about acquisitions as a 4% favorable, and then FX is 4% to 5% unfavorable in the first half. When we go to the back half, it\u2019s really relatively flat - organic sales 4%, acquisition, and then FX starts to moderate and is maybe flat to negative 1%.  Then as it relates to the range, I would tell you that--you know, appreciate roughly 50% systems and 50% parts and consumables, and we have pretty good visibility on the systems side. The parts and consumables again is a shorter book and ship time frame, and so we\u2019re just looking at our order entry and monitoring that and being--you know, putting a range particularly on the back half, and so as you see our Q1 guidance is relatively tight and, to your point on the earnings, the interest expense will be a headwind to earnings in Q1 particularly. Jeff Hammond : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Connor Lynagh : Yes, thanks. A similar line of questioning here. Basically, can you help us think through how much price you\u2019re carrying into next year, and then how much visibility you have on that and how much you\u2019re thinking about upside-downside on that, and sort of similar question on volume. Joe Kelley : Yes, so if you think about it, our price, we exited Q4 with roughly 4% realization in price, so as you can appreciate, that impact grew throughout 2022 as we realized inflation and then we took pricing actions to pass that inflation through. As a reminder, our stated strategy was to pass through the inflation, not the inflation plus 55% gross margins, and we were effective on that. It had a diluted impact on the percentage but we were effective. To your point, we\u2019re carrying into Q1, so part of the first half growth, organic growth of 4% to 5%, you can probably think about that as roughly split - half would be pricing given the timing of price realization last year, and half of that would be volume. Then as you can appreciate, as you get then to the back half of next year, the pricing impact on a year-over-year basis will be less simply because we had realized more throughout the year as we experienced the inflation. All that said, we clearly remain in a dynamic environment and responsive. As the cost pressures and inflation change throughout the year, we will be responsive, and again we\u2019re targeting and we\u2019ve been successful in maintaining incremental operating profit margins of 40% to 45% on the organic growth - we delivered that in Q3 at 43, we delivered that for the full year at 55%, which was actually ahead of our target, so that\u2019s how we think about it and, to your point, we\u2019ll continue to manage that. Sundaram Nagarajan : One thing to add to our pricing effectiveness, there are a couple of things to remember. The gross margins are over 50%, right, that is because we create value for our customers, and this value allows us to get paid for any cost increases that we have, so we\u2019ve been very prudent in managing the cost increases. But you\u2019ve got to remember, we create value and we get paid for it. The second thing I would tell you, from our customers\u2019 point of view, our cost structure in their total cost stack is a fairly small number, so we are a low cost component creating incredible value and critical value, and that allows us to continue to be effective along price increases. But you know, we certainly want to protect our customer relationships and we\u2019re being prudent, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see us do in this environment that we are experiencing. Connor Lynagh : Yes, understood. Thank you for the context there.  Just thinking through the guidance range, maybe just a little bit of a clarifying point, are you--when you think about the high end versus the low end, are there certain end markets that you are risking higher or lower? You made the comment earlier about the systems versus components, but can you just sort of clarify if there is specific markets that you\u2019re particularly watching in driving that wide range or is it just the broad economic uncertainty? Sundaram Nagarajan : I think the way to think about our range is that, first as Joe indicated and reiterated, we are very comfortable because of the visibility we have and because of the system orders we have. There is a split between the first quarter and the second quarter given Chinese New Year timing as well as systems shipments. But second half, Connor, we are assuming flattish growth on some very historic record revenue levels that we were running in \u201922. We expect all of our segments to grow in the year, albeit single digits, so. The two end markets we are watching that we\u2019ve talked about is our biopharma fluid components, which is 20% of our MFS segment, it\u2019s a small part of our MFS segment. That is where we have customer inventory is fairly high, from what we understand, so we\u2019ll watch that one. The other one that I indicated was our dispense business in the ATS segment, which has had some incredible growth here in the past two years. What you see--you know, coming into the quarter, there was some unfavorable book to bill trends there, so we\u2019re watching that, so those would be the two we would be watching. Our industrial businesses seem to be remaining pretty solid, our system industrial businesses are actually growing very nicely. Our medical business is back to pre-COVID levels, which is our medical interventional business, I should say, so. Hopefully that gives you some more color. Connor Lynagh : It does, thank you very much. Operator : Once again, if you would like to ask a question, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Your next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thanks, good morning guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joe Kelley : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : I have a question. Was interested to hear the call-out on the polymer product lines. I don\u2019t recall if that got a call-out in recent quarters, but curious if you\u2019re seeing some emerging vibrancy in those markets or kind of a recap trend. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I think that is a business--if you remember, a number of years, a few years ago, we had exited our [indiscernible] barrels business but we kept some parts of the business that we really liked which had some long term trends, and so--and certainly we\u2019ve had to address a number of cost structure issues in that business over the period of time. I have a great leadership team that\u2019s taken us through that and has positioned the business to go after the best growth opportunities there, and so all that work has resulted in a pretty nice growth rate.  Again, this is a business that we liked. There were parts of the business we liked and there were parts we did not like, but I think we\u2019re in a place where this is a good business and it is growing nicely for us. I wouldn\u2019t say this is our biggest strategic part of the company [indiscernible] medical growth and test and inspection growth, but it is a solid part of our portfolio. We really appreciate what the team has done in this part of the business to really reposition the business, and now it is growing. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Is there any different appetite or healthier trends in the end markets? Sundaram Nagarajan : I would say a couple of things. There is certainly this whole trend around recycling, it\u2019s a trend that is certainly benefiting this business. What we also see is in some parts of the business, there is some specialty film that is used in EV battery manufacturing that they have a pretty good customer base. Again, these are all small opportunities, Chris. I don\u2019t want to make it to be significant, but it really has pretty nice momentum in these two areas and the team is doing--and there is some bio plastic materials also that the team is working on, so. Again, singles and doubles is the way you want to think about [indiscernible]. I think the bigger takeaway should be the company is, you know, with some incredible leadership from our teams, reposition [indiscernible] better place and growing. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. On ATS--or in MFS, rather, I wanted to look at the non-medical side. I think it\u2019s basically EFD, something over a couple hundred million. Just want to remind what the customers and applications are there, the cyclicality and how that\u2019s positioned. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, that business is--you know, it\u2019s actually one of our most diversified applications. Quite frankly, [indiscernible] fluid dispensing applications to electronics dispensing applications to life sciences. That business wins with applications, so it\u2019s pretty diversified. [Indiscernible] GDP kind of growth is what it typically does, maybe a little bit more if the electronics cycle is going strong for them. It\u2019s a good business but a growing part of it is also life sciences. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude the Q&A session of today\u2019s call. I will now turn the call back over to Naga for any closing comments. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you for your time and attention on today\u2019s call. Our core capabilities combined with the NBS Next growth framework positions us well for a dynamic environment. This was evidenced in 2022 and we expect it to position us well for fiscal 2023 as well. We remain focused on achieving our long term objective of delivering top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. We wish you a happy holiday season. Operator : This concludes the Nordson Corporation fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nordson Corporation First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I will now turn the conference over to Lara Mahoney. You may begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, February 21, to report Nordson's fiscal 2023 first quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Tuesday, February 28, 2023. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss the first quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. Joe will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will then share a high-level commentary about our earnings performance. He will conclude with an update on the fiscal 2023 full year and second quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2023 first quarter conference call. I want to thank our team for delivering another strong first quarter performance. There were a lot of bright spots in this quarter. To begin, it was the first quarter of contribution from our CyberOptics acquisition. The integration of the business is going well, and we are pleased with energy and engagement of our CyberOptics team. Test and inspection is a long-term growth focus for Nordson and we are very excited about the differentiated optical precision technology that CyberOptics adds to our portfolio. Next, we had a solid regional performance in the Americas and Europe, which collectively delivered 9% organic growth. This was partially offset by declines in Asia Pacific which saw weakness in China relating not only to the Lunar New Year shutdown, but also labor shortages due to the unfortunate spread of COVID-19 in the region. Once again, the diversification of our business and our steadfast dedication to the needs of our customers ensures we deliver results. Finally, I remain pleased by the ongoing deployment of the NBS Next growth framework. Each division is gaining momentum towards achieving top-tier growth, quality and on-time delivery performance. In this dynamic environment, NBS Next ensures we are focused on our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and it also clarifies where we can simplify so we can better focus resources on those opportunities. In a few moments, I will speak more about the business, and what we are seeing in our end markets, but first, I'll turn the call over to Joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joe Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 5, you'll see first quarter fiscal 2023 sales were $610 million comparable to the prior year's first quarter sales of $609 million. The increase was primarily related to 1% organic growth plus the CyberOptics acquisition, offset by unfavorable currency impact of 4%. The organic growth, as Naga referenced, was driven by strong demand in Europe and the Americas, offset by weakness in Asia Pacific, primarily China. Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $329 million. Excluding the amortization of acquired inventory step-up, gross profit totaled $333 million or 55% of sales, a 3% or 150 basis point decrease compared to the $342 million or 56% of sales in the prior year first quarter. The team continues to actively manage the price/cost dynamic in these inflationary periods in addition to unfavorable currency impacts. Similar to the fourth quarter of 2022, the impact of passing along the significant year-over-year cost inflation while slightly positive in gross profit dollars squeeze margins approximately 100 basis points. Additionally, the sales mix in the quarter was slightly unfavorable, with biopharma, fluid dispense and product assembly in Asia being down offset by growth in plastics processing and medical interventional solutions. On a sequential basis, comparing first quarter to fourth quarter 2022, adjusted gross margins improved approximately 150 basis points. Operating profit totaled $144 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we reported onetime transaction fees, inventory step-up and other nonrecurring items associated with the CyberOptics acquisition totaling $10 million. Adjusted operating profit excluding these nonrecurring items, was $155 million in the quarter or 25% of sales, 2% below the prior year adjusted operating profit of $157 million. Foreign currency translation negatively impacted operating profit 6%, offset by 4% constant currency operating profit growth. EBITDA for the first quarter was $181 million or 30% of sales, which is in line with our long-term target profitability level and comparable to the prior year first quarter. Looking at nonoperating expenses, interest expense increased $5 million associated with higher borrowings and interest rates. Other net expense increased $4 million related to higher foreign exchange losses and increased hedge costs, partially offset by lower nonoperating pension costs. Tax expense was $27 million for an effective tax rate of 20.5% in the quarter, which is in line with the prior year first quarter rate and the forecasted full year rate for 2023. Net income in the quarter totaled $104 million or $1.81 per share. Adjusted earnings share, excluding nonrecurring acquisition cost, totaled $1.95 per share, a 6% decrease from the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by unfavorable currency changes. Now let's turn to Slide 6 through 8 to review the first quarter 2023 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $312 million decreased 4% compared to the prior year first quarter due to unfavorable currency impacts of 5%. The organic growth of 1% was driven by steady demand across most product lines and regions, offset by softness in Asia Pacific particularly product assembly China due to the timing of Chinese New Year and labor shortages from the spread of COVID-19. Operating profit in quarter was $102 million or 33% of sales, which is a decrease of 1% compared to the prior year adjusted operating profit of $104 million. Unfavorable currency negatively impacted operating profit year-over-year, 6%. IPS remains our most globally diverse segment and therefore, most exposed to currency translation changes. Looking on a constant currency basis and organic only, this segment now has delivered quarterly sales and operating profit growth, 8 out of the last 9 quarters, highlighting the strength of business, the team and the execution of the Ascend strategy. Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $154 million decreased 3% compared to the prior year's first quarter. This change included a decrease in organic sales of 1% and a 2% decrease related to unfavorable currency impacts. The 1% organic decrease was driven by significant softness in the medical Fluid components serving the biopharma market and Fluid Solutions product lines in China, offset by strong demand for Medical Interventional Solutions product lines, primarily in the Americas and Europe. First quarter operating profit was $39 million or 26% of sales, which is a decrease $10 million compared to the prior year operating profit of $49 million. The decrease in operating profit was driven by meaningful sales mix changes within the medical product lines and related individual factory inefficiency due to reduced volumes. Turning to Slide 8. You'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales were $145 million, a 14% increase compared to the prior year first quarter. Organic sales growth in the quarter was 5% plus another 14% from the CyberOptics acquisition. This was offset by an unfavorable currency impact of 4%. The organic growth was particularly strong in the Americas region and was driven by the Test and Inspection acoustic product line, which continues to benefit from new product innovation. First quarter adjusted operating profit, excluding the inventory step-up and acquisition transaction expenses was $27 million or 19% of sales, which was comparable to the prior year first quarter operating profit. Organic operating profit growth of 3% plus the acquisition benefit was offset by a 5% unfavorable currency impact. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. Our first quarter balance sheet includes cash of $122 million and net debt was $894 million, resulting in a 1.1x leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic opportunities inclusive of the borrowing that we incurred to fund the CyberOptics acquisition in November. Free cash flow in the quarter was $114 million, or a conversion rate of net income of 109%, an $8 million improvement over the prior year first quarter free cash flow. Dividend payments were $37 million, reflective of the 27% increase in the annual dividend approved last year. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares under our 10b5-1 plan. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 2023, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22%, and capital expenditures of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We will now turn to Slide 10, and I will turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thanks, Joe. I want to thank our teams or continuing to respond to the needs of our customers and deliver the strong first quarter performance. I'm very thankful that our operations in China are returning to normal as employees have returned to work following the spread of COVID-19 in the region. We will always prioritize the health and safety of our employees and we are so glad that they are well. Throughout the first quarter, I had many opportunities to engage with our employees and travel to sites in North America and Europe. I'm very pleased with the ongoing deployment of NBS Next, which continues to help us prioritize our greatest opportunities for profitable growth. In this dynamic environment, the accelerated deployment of this growth framework will guide our decisions on where to focus and where to simplify. Going into fiscal 2023, we knew we would be dealing with a dynamic environment as we have limited visibility into the full year. Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing what we are now seeing in our end markets. In the Industrial Precision Solutions segment, we are seeing increasing demand in automotive and steady demand in industrials and consumer nondurable product lines. Packaging and product assembly end markets continued to perform well in Americas and Europe, and there is softness in China. Within the Advanced Technology Solutions segment, we have started to see a softening of semiconductor orders over the past 45 days. Electronics is known for being a cyclical end market, and we benefited from the boom in investments over the past two years. Now our customers are starting to reevaluate near-term capital spending, which is having an impact on orders for electronic dispense product lines. In some cases, it's been a matter of pushing out system orders into the second half. We will continue to monitor this closely. We're also seeing weakness in optical Test and Inspection product lines relating to the memory end market. Our remaining Test and Inspection order rate remains strong is somewhat offsetting the areas of weakness in the segment. C&I is benefiting from new product innovation such as our new acoustic system that drove growth in the first quarter. The strategy to diversify our APS product offering in terms of technology and application is muting the historical volatility of the company's overall electronics exposure. Turning to the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment. We are experiencing double-digit growth in our Interventional Solutions product lines. This is a business that was pressured during the pause in elective surgeries during the pandemic. And now these product lines are returning to high single-digit growth levels. Orders for balloons, cannulas and catheters are a big part of our backlog. Elsewhere in the MFS segment, we're seeing continued weakness in our medical fluid components product lines. Over the past two years, we benefited from strong double-digit organic growth in this division. This was driven by demand from biopharma customers which partially benefited from the COVID vaccines and then from inventory rebuilding to compensate for supply chain concerns following the pandemic. Now we believe there is inventory destocking at large customers for these product lines. Over the medium to long term, revenue growth rates for these product lines remain strong, driven by secular growth drivers such as single-use components in biopharma applications. Finally, in our MFS Fluid Solutions product lines, we are seeing some weakening in injection molded product lines relating to the construction as well electronics applications in China. Considering the combination of end market headwinds and tailwinds, current order entry and the pushout of delivery dates, we are updating our previously provided 2023 revenue guidance to 0% to 3% growth over fiscal 2022 and adjusted earnings in the range of $8.75 to $9.50. I remind investors, while we are seeing some changes in order patterns, our guidance reflects sustaining our record-level 2022 performance, which is a testament to our dedicated employees, the diversification of our business and the solid execution of the Ascend strategy. Looking specifically at the second quarter 2023 on Slide 13, we are forecasting second quarter fiscal 2023 sales to be comparable to the prior year second quarter as acquisition benefits are largely offset by currency headwinds. Second quarter earnings are forecasted in the range of $2 to $2.15 per share reflective of the anticipated sales mix, which is comparable to the first quarter of 2023, while we remain financially prudent in this environment, we are adopting a balanced approach and will remain invested in innovation, differentiated service experience for our customers in strong core businesses. We also will continue to accelerate strategic investments to fully participate in high-growth markets while making tactical adjustments to cost structure in select businesses when it is needed. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hi, good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joe Kelley : Good morning. Mike Halloran : So Naga, obviously, a lot of moving pieces here. Maybe help understand the change in 2Q and call it, a little bit more stability in how you're thinking about the back half of the year here. It seems like the outsized 2Q that we were -- you were talking about in the last quarter has been pushed in the back half. So maybe talk a little bit about the backlog, why you think it's sustainable risk in cancellations, what kind of seasonality you're assuming front half versus back half versus a normal year? And just any of the puts and takes to help understand those moving pieces a little bit better? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Mike, what I'll do is I'll take you through segment by segment, the end market trends. And then, Joe, if you could sort of bridge some of the questions that Mike has, will be great. So first and foremost, in the last 45 days what we have really seen, orders have fallen off approximately 9% versus the prior run rates. And portions of this could be attributed to Chinese New Year, some of it could be are softening in the electronic process solutions business, which essentially does fluid dispensing for semiconductor and back-end electronics. What you also are seeing is that in these end markets, in addition to softer orders, we have had customer requested pushouts of order delivery, right? So that's -- those are the two things that are happening. Broadly, let's go segment by segment. If you look at our industrial precision solutions, we're running at or above our long-term growth rates, increasing demand in automotive, steady demand in industrials and consumer nondurable product lines, packaging and product assembly, particularly pretty -- doing fairly well in Americas and Europe with some softness in China. So IPS in general, we feel really good about where the orders are, where the backlog is and how we're thinking about Q2 and the rest of the year. If you come to Advanced Technologies, this is below our long-term growth rates. One thing to remind you is that the growth rates we are looking for in this segment, particularly, because we have diversified the volatility in the segment is suddenly muted than what we have seen the past. So a couple of things happening here, as I said, softening semiconductor orders over the past 45 days. Electronics traditionally being cyclical. We benefited in the first two years. And what we are now seeing is the downside of cycle. Our customers are beginning to reevaluate more the near-term capital spending versus the long-term capital spending. We still feel good about the long term. But in the short term, there is some softness in the orders. We're also seeing some weakness in our optical test and inspection product lines as it relates to the memory end market. Remaining test and inspection looks pretty strong. And if we go to -- now going to our medical fluid components, this is also below our long-term growth rates, but there are two different things happening here. What you find is double-digit growth in our interventional product lines. So this is the part of the business where we were pressured due to postponement of elective surgery during the pandemic, and now you see this business coming back pretty strong. And orders for balloons, cannulas, catheters are really a big part of our backlog. And in our biopharma-facing fluid component business, the order rates continue to be -- continue to be weaker than we had expected. And this is partially driven by our biopharma customers who are destocking inventory. During the pandemic, they benefited partially from COVID, but also where rebuilding their inventory because of supply chain concerns. We fundamentally believe this is a strong business. It will get back to the high single digits in time. And the last bit, I would say, is there is some weakening in our fluid dispensing injected motor product lines in construction as well as electronics in China. So hopefully, that gave you -- I gave you a lot of things here, but give you some color segment by segment, what we are seeing. Joe, you want to - sorry, go ahead Joe. Joe Kelley : Yes. Maybe if I could reconcile those comments to your questions around the guidance and the change in the guidance. So if you think about our revenue guidance at the midpoint, we brought it down by about $65 million from the prior guidance. The majority of that decrease is what Naga referenced and what we're seeing in a change in orders around the semiconductor and back-end electronics market. The remainder is the delay in the timing of the biopharma recovery and I would tell you also a little bit of the softness that we saw here in Q1 in China. From a timing perspective on the guidance, Mike, your question there, the timing is adjusted, not just for the order entry, but it's also given customer the pushouts of their delivery dates. And we're seeing that in electronic end markets. These are large system orders where we have prepayments from the customers. But we're seeing it in electronics, a little bit in the industrial coatings and in the plastics end markets where they're pushing out Q2 delivery dates into the back half. And again, we have prepayments on these, and so there's limited risk of cancellation. And then as it relates to your comments, as we think about the guidance in the back half versus Q2, when you think about the back half, first of all, last year's back half was very, very strong. As you know, for Nordson, a record Q3, followed by record Q4. And so the guidance, when you look at the back half, FX is going to become favorable on a year-over-year basis if we maintain the current exchange rates. So that would be would be favorable about 2%, acquisitions about 3%. And so it basically implies at the midpoint, the organic would be down about 2% in the back half based on comments Naga just made. Mike Halloran : That's a lot of great color. I really appreciate it. So follow-up then on the fluid component side. What do you guys think the destocking is going to be behind you and maybe more normal order patterns start coming through, at least relative to underlying demand. And should we think about this as the right run rate for the margins of that segment until that mix is more balanced out versus normal? Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me just comment on the order rates and, Joe, you can pick up on the margin for the segment. Order rates, what we are seeing is the customer order patterns have stabilized and might there be some green shoots in terms of a recovery of order rates from these customers. Long term, 7% to 8%, high single digits is how you want to think about this business. I'd love tell you that I know exactly when this is going to come back. From what we can see is we feel good about the stability in the orders and a slight pickup in orders that we're beginning to see if you push me to give an exact date, it's going to be difficult. But definitely, this is a recovery that has already begun is probably the best way to put it. Joe Kelley : Mike, on the margins, the segment, as you know, in '21 was running at about 31%, '22 at about 32%. So this 26 that we did in Q1 is not the new normal, we would anticipate to recover back to the historical run rate as we move forward in '23. And the logic there is this initial drop off and then the comment I made on inefficiencies of -- within the individual factories as they adjust for this volume drop and adjust their variable cost that efficiency will improve as we move forward. Mike Halloran : Great. Really helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Alice. Allison Poliniak : Just turning to IPS, it seems pretty stable. Asia Pacific was a headwind this quarter. Do we assume that headwind starts to mitigate here for Asia Pacific where that growth may be is a slight improvement from quarter-to-quarter. Just trying to think through that between 2Q and 3Q? Thanks. Joe Kelley : Yes. Allison, I would tell you, as you know, our IPS business has a large China presence and Chinese New Year fell into Q2 last year versus in Q1 this year, so you will see sequential improvement in that segment, just given that. And then also within that business, I referenced the Industrial Coatings division as well as the Plastics division where there are large systems businesses. Those businesses are seeing some of those Q2 push-outs in the back half. And again, prepayments for all of those systems locked in. It's predominantly our customers, their projects are being delayed. Their projects are still taking place, but they're being delayed for other reasons, and they're asking those businesses to delay shipment in the back half, so sequential improvement and then sequential improvement first half into second half. Allison Poliniak : Got it, thanks. And then Naga, you had talked about NBS Next in the innovation side. How are you thinking about that investment this year? Are you starting to tighten the lens a bit more? Are we looking for an increase there as you look to position the company coming out of this, just any thoughts there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I think - the way to think about it is our NBS Next deployment is accelerating, gaining momentum within the company. And it is becoming more holistic than it was maybe two years ago. So what does that all mean? That means that our businesses are really sharp on what are the best opportunities, division-by-division, not the entire company in total, but division-by-division. And staying invested in innovation in our core strong businesses. That is a top priority for us. And we are also accelerating capital investments in businesses where we have pretty strong growth. For example, our interventional business, very recently, we have signed off on a significant capital to expand product lines, right? So I feel really good about where we are. I think it is really important to remember, not only are we staying invested in our core businesses where we have strong positions. But we're also investing in businesses that are - have a growth potential for us. In some cases, where the order entry has declined, we are adjusting cost more from a variable perspective. But even in those cases, we stay invested in our innovation in our electronic businesses, because that's - that is the source of our differentiation. Our customers count on us. These are not three-month kind of thinking process. This is multiyear because in our electronics business, most of customers long- term, we are going to see significant capital investments to expand capacity for semiconductor in North America and in Europe. And we need to stay relevant in those, continue to participate in those and fully leverage our technologies. Allison Poliniak : Great, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Is there any way that you guys can sort of parse out and try and quantify what the China-related impact was as it, pertain to COVID and the associated labor shortages? How much may be pushed at the end of the quarter due to the New Year - and do you think all of that gets recaptured in Q2 or is that also now become part of this just push out into the latter half of year? And then I have a quick follow-up. Joe Kelley : So, let me take a stab at quantifying that. I would tell you, when we study the timing of the Chinese New Year is probably just $15 million to $20 million, depending on what quarter that falls into. And so that's consistent on our full year basis and has no impact. The COVID issues that they experienced right before the New Year and the lockdown at some of customer and supply chain challenges. I would characterize that as closer to about a $10 million disruption in the quarter. And I don't know that, that recovers in the full year. And so that was what I would tell you, part of our reduction in full year guidance was that about $10 million miss in Q1 in China, anticipating that, that doesn't recover itself within the year or make itself up in the year. Matt Summerville : Got it. And then maybe can you just comment on CyberOptics and what you're sort of expecting, if I recollect annualized revenues around the time you announced the acquisition were a little more than $100 million. You look at the contribution in Q1, clearly, nowhere near that run rate. So can you talk about maybe what you're seeing in that business and what a reasonable kind of year one, revenue in accretion outlook might be for that business? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Matt, thank you for the question and follow-up. And on CyberOptics, we're incredibly pleased with the team, incredibly pleased with the technology that we are adding to company, incredibly pleased with the long-term prospects of this optical inspection capability positions the company for long-term in a really good way. In the short term, however, as you've noticed that what we see really is the memory market, which is sort of one of those areas where they're really strong in, is not near-term capital investments have been delayed. And because of that, they have not at the same run rate as what we had expected, right. And Joe, if you could spend a little time talking - that would helpful? Joe Kelley : Yes, so I mean, as we highlighted in the first quarter, $17 million of sales. I can tell you - as a favorable - contributed favorably to our operating profit. And from an EBITDA standpoint, it's running in the mid-teens. And so, when you think about our forecast going forward, we have that contributing on the full year, approximately 3% to our year-over-year sales growth and to be contributing to operating profit growth on an adjusted basis. Matt Summerville : Understood, thank you guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yep. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of sticking on the electronics for a second, there's been some concern, I think, from investors on this space for a while. So was the softening in semi orders a surprise to you? And how have conversations with customers changed? Sundaram Nagarajan : In terms of - is this a surprise? Certainly, the last 45 days, our order dropped off or it changed. It's not surprising, but more in line with what you're, hearing our customers sort of report on the outside. So if you think about semiconductor customers or memory customers, all of them very bullish about their investments in the long-term, but certainly reevaluating what they spend in the short-term as they manage through their P&L. So in line with what you would expect in the marketplace. But if you think about in the longer term, and if you compare with our volatility in the past, this is certainly muted. And what we are hearing from them is very bullish about the longer term, 24.5. Certainly, in the short-term, they're reevaluating spend. And is sort of how I would think about it, is that a surprise? Yes, the order rate decline in the 45 days was certainly surprised. But what is also strong is T&I excluding Optical, it is pretty strong and strong and continues to remain has a very strong backlog, and we think we'll do really well there. So I think this diversification and expansion into T&I has certainly reduced the company's historical volatility or muted the cyclicality. Saree, did I answer you? Saree Boroditsky : Yes, thanks for that. And then you talked about, obviously, the push out of systems in the second half in industrial coatings. Could you provide more color on why these systems are being pushed out? And then generally, does your guidance assume any additional push outs across the segments and into 2024? Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me take sort of what we are seeing with our customers and why the push outs. And then, Joe, if you have any additional color you can add to that. One of the things that I would tell you is, think, about our systems as large subsystems that go in a part of a larger manufacturing line. So typically, that's what we do. We play a - so when you have a large construction project of it, we don't hear any of our customers saying, these capital expansions are going away. That's not what we're hearing. What we are hearing is that in the construction phase of it, they do have other vendors that they are expecting delivery of systems, subsystems from are delayed and hence don't need this delivery in this quarter, right? And so it has been pushed to the second half. And the reason we are confident about this is just the prepayments. So all of these large system orders come with repayments and our prepayment increases are in line with our backlog increases. And so we feel pretty good about it. And that's -- hopefully, that gives you what you're looking for. Joe Kelley : Yes. And Saree, if I could add to your question around timing in 2023, 2024, -- it's -- when you look at these large systems businesses in the industrial coating space and the test inspection space and the plastic space, those businesses, combined with our Medical Interventional Solutions, those are the businesses that comprise over 70% of our backlog. And so there are orders already on the books going out into 2024 for those divisions. And so when you think about our backlog and our confidence, it's not so much just '23, but it actually goes into '24 for that subset of the Nordson businesses. And so that means that, that supports, I'd say, less than half of our revenue. And so greater than half of our revenue is supported by only 30% of our backlog -- And so it's that portion of the business where our backlog only price is less than one quarter of sales. And so there is where we're more subject to changing order patterns and we need book and ship business in the quarter for that portion of the business. Sundaram Nagarajan : One thing I would also just add to that is in these businesses where we have book and ship, our recurring revenues are more than 50% of our revenue. So -- and in those businesses, it's in some cases, a little higher. So our confidence level in these businesses more comes down to the fact that our customer confidence level on the supply chain has improved, and I think that's the good news. The good news is in 50% of our businesses, the customer has begins to believe that supply chain problems have gone away. And hence, their order entry are sort of in line with what you would expect for their real demand is. So that -- for me, that gives me pretty good confidence as well. Saree Boroditsky : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Walter Liptak with Seaport. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the Industrial Precision segment. And just see if I can get a little bit more color on orders in the Americas and in Europe. And specifically about what's going well. I think you called out automotive, industrial and packaging. And I wonder if you could just talk about the last 45 days there and just the tone of the business, how you're feeling about it. Joe Kelley : Yes, Walt, thanks for the question. Yes. In that that business, segment I think about it as we see the steady growth in line, as Naga mentioned with our long-term growth rates. And so there, what's driving it is, as we referenced, Americas and Europe, particularly in the quarter. But it's our consumer non-durable has been pretty steady in line growth for us. There, you'll recall is where we have several of our new product launches that were contributed to last year's performance and continue to gain traction. It's also within that, the largest factory within that segment was a pilot site for our NBS next. And so when you think about the traction and the improvement that they're having there with their on-time delivery, it's contributing to that growth as well. So that -- and then if you go to the coating side, as Naga mentioned, we're seeing a pickup, I would tell you, in automotive demand for the Industrial Coatings business there. Walter Liptak : Okay. Good. Yes. So just to be clear, there was the steadiness that you were speaking of that was signed throughout the quarter and not just on average, but including in that 45-day period where other parts of the business soften. Joe Kelley : Yes. As we said, it's -- the term, as I would say, a multi-speed economy. You have some that are going down, some that are steady and some of that are growing nicely. And I would lump that business into the steady growth in line with our long-term expectations. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great. Great. And then just as a follow-up in IPS, how are you feeling about price cost? It sounds like you were a little bit positive this quarter, how are you feeling about the rest of the year? Joe Kelley : Yes. So price cost, again, as we communicated in Q4 and here in Q1, it is net favorable from a gross margin dollar standpoint, but it is dilutive from a gross margin percent standpoint. But we have been successful in passing through the inflation but not passing through the inflation plus the 55% gross margin. So in diluted -- it's diluted our consolidated Nordson margins by about 100 basis points. And I would tell you this division has been successful and they incurred a significant inflation. And so passing that through this division clearly has, I would say, led the way and been successful in that pricing initiative. Walter Liptak : Okay. That sounds great. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi, good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So you guys gave a lot of great color on kind of where the softness is. But I'm just wondering if you can kind of maybe parse out the split between -- it seems like IPS, no change. And then maybe the split between medical and ATS in terms of like the cut? Is it 50-50? Is it heavier one way or the other? Joe Kelley : Yes. I would tell you, as I -- if you think about the change in our guidance, and so we dropped the midpoint on revenue, $65 million, the majority of that is simply in response to the semiconductor, what we're seeing in that market. And so -- from a segment perspective, the reduction is greater in ATS than it is in the MFS segment. Jeff Hammond : Okay. That's really helpful then. And then just -- what are you hearing in terms of how long this medical destocking will take? And kind of what have you built in there? Sundaram Nagarajan : I think the way to think about this -- and I'd love to be able to give you a more precise answer on when this is going to come back. What I can tell you is the declines have stabilized, and we are beginning to see some recovery in order entry from big biopharma customers. And that is -- that's based on what we see today. I would hate to give you any more detail because it will be more speculation from my perspective. I feel really good about our loan because we feel this is going to be a strong high single-digit growth company. This is -- we have no -- our long-term prospects on secular growth drives of single-use components in this space still holds good. We expect a further more increasing use and less increasing use, but not answering your question on when exactly we will see this fully normalized. I sure hope it will be sooner than later, but -- what I -- what we are beginning to see and we feel confident about is that stabilized beginning to see recovery. Jeff Hammond : That's great. And just -- Joe Kelley : I mean, that was part of the change in the guidance. If you think about our Q2 guide before, we thought the recovery might come in Q2, it appears to be delayed about in our guidance a quarter. Jeff Hammond : Okay. That's great. Just last one on CyberOptics. I don't know if there was seasonality, I don't recall it from their filings is, is the 1Q kind of revenue contribution run rate the right way to think about the go forward? Or is there some seasonal step up? Or -- and maybe just -- I don't know, it seems like that business is softer. Is that business going to be down year-on-year? Joe Kelley : Yes, I would I would -- I guess comment, I wouldn't take the Q1 run rate and say annualize that. I think Q1 for that business like many businesses, is light. Again, our Q1 includes Thanksgiving. Our Q1 includes Christmas and our Q1 included the Chinese New Year. So I would think that their Q1 is not indicative of their quarterly run rate but probably $15 million to $20 million -- or 15% to 20% light. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. On a year-on-year basis, yes, they would be lighter, but it's not I wouldn't take our first quarter and run with that. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks so much. Joe Kelley : Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. So I will now turn the call back to Naga for additional and closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Our first quarter performance was solid, and it reflects the strength of our differentiated position technology, customer-centric business model and diversified geographic and product end markets. While we are seeing some change in order patterns, 2023 remains a strong year with our guidance reflecting our ability to sustain our record 2022 performance. We will remain financially prudent in this environment. We'll adopt a balanced approach that remains invested in innovation and differentiated service experience for our customers in strong core businesses. Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, May 23, to report Nordson's fiscal 2023 second quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our Web site at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor Web site and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Tuesday, May 30, 2023. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss second quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. Joe will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will then share a high-level commentary about our earnings performance. He will conclude with an update on the fiscal 2023 full year and third quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2023 second quarter conference call. During the second quarter, Nordson continued to experience a macro environment that can be described as a multi-speed economy. Customer demand in industrial, consumer non-durable and medical interventional end markets were solid.  Alternatively, electronic dispense product lines are being negatively impacted by the downside of the semiconductor cycle. And sales of biopharma product lines in our medical fluid components division continues to normalize the gains challenging prior year comparisons as customers continue to work through excess inventory. These factors balance themselves out and the team delivered organic sales growth of 1% compared to prior year's second quarter.  During the quarter, the teams also took targeted cost actions in areas where we are seeing weakness in customer demand. We believe these will enable us to effectively navigate the current business environment and strengthen our long-term position for profitable growth. Overall, we remain invested in our competitive differentiators, including our direct sales force, product innovation, and the training and execution of NBS Next growth framework. In a few moments, I'll speak more about the business and what we're seeing in our end markets. But first, I'll turn the call over to Joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Joe Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide 5, you will see second quarter fiscal 2023 sales were $650 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year's second quarter sales of $635 million. The increase was driven by organic growth of 1% and a 3% benefit from the CyberOptics acquisition offset by unfavorable currency impact of 2%. During the quarter, sales were strong in Asia Pacific with 7% growth, partially reflecting the timing difference related to the Chinese New Year.  Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $352 million. Excluding severance costs, gross profit totaled $354 million, or 55% of sales, comparable to first quarter 2023 profitability as the team continues to actively manage the price cost dynamic and these inflationary periods. When compared to the prior year, adjusted gross margins are down 180 basis points resulting from sales mix changes and factory inefficiencies at sites dealing with reduced volumes.  Operating profit totaled $173 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we recorded one-time severance costs totaling $3 million. Adjusted operating profit, excluding these non-recurring items, was $176 million in the quarter, or 27% of sales, 4% below the prior year adjusted operating profit of $184 million.  EBITDA for the second quarter was $203 million, or 31% of sales, which is in line with our long-term target profitability level; however, $6 million below the prior year EBITDA of $209 million. The decrease was primarily driven by a $4 million currency translation headwind plus unfavorable sales mix, offset by the CyberOptics acquisition growth.  Looking at non-operating expenses, interest expense increased $5 million associated with higher borrowings and increased interest rates. Other net expense decreased $38 million, primarily related to the prior year non-recurring, non-cash pension annuitization charge of $41 million. Tax expense was 34 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is in line with the prior year second quarter rate and the forecasted full year rate for 2023.  Net income in the quarter totaled $128 million, or $2.21 per share. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-recurring severance costs, totaled $2.26 per share, a 7% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings. The decrease is primarily driven by lower operating profit and higher interest expense.  Now let's turn to Slide 6 through 8 to review the second quarter 2023 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $336 million increased 6% compared to the prior year second quarter, driven by strong organic growth of 9%, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts of 2%. The organic growth was driven by robust demand in the polymer processing product lines as well as products sold into consumer non-durable end markets across most regions. Operating profit for the quarter was $112 million, or 33% of sales, which is an increase of 9% compared to the prior year adjusted operating profit of $102 million despite some unfavorable currency translation impacts. As mentioned last quarter, IPS remains our most globally diverse segment, and therefore most exposed to currency translation changes and the timing difference with the Chinese New Year.  Looking on a constant currency basis and year-to-date, this segment has delivered 5% organic growth and incremental margins of 60% ahead of our targeted 40% to 45% incremental margins. This segment's continued strong performance demonstrates the power of the NBS Next growth framework.  On Slide 7, you'll see Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $167 million, decreased 3% compared to the prior year's second quarter. This change included a decrease in organic sales of 2% and a 1% decrease related to unfavorable currency impacts.  Strong demand for medical interventional solutions product lines, primarily in the Americas, was more than offset by softness in the medical fluid components serving biopharma applications and fluid solutions product lines in Europe and Asia. These factors drove a net 2% organic sales decrease.  During the second quarter, we took targeted cost actions in businesses responding to volume pressure that resulted in $1 million of non-recurring severance costs. Second quarter adjusted operating profit was $49 million, or 30% of sales, which is a decrease of $9 million compared to the prior year operating profit of $58 million. The decrease in operating profit was driven by the meaningful sales mix changes within the medical product lines and related factory inefficiencies due to reduced volumes. It is noteworthy that the segment profitability sequentially improved 400 basis points over the first quarter of 2023 and is again running more in line with the profitability levels of the prior two years.  Turning to Slide 8, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales were $148 million, a 1% increase compared to the prior year second quarter. During the quarter, the CyberOptics acquisition contributed 12% growth. Organic sales volumes were down 10% and unfavorable currency impact during the quarter was 2%. The organic decrease was driven by electronics dispense products serving the semiconductor end markets in the Americas and Asia, slightly offset by continued growth in the test and inspection product lines. Cost reduction actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to address the significant decrease in electronics dispense product lines were structural in nature and resulted in $2 million of non-recurring severance costs.  The second quarter adjusted operating profit was $28 million, or 19% of sales, which was below the prior year second quarter operating profit of $40 million. The decrease in adjusted operating profit was driven by the organic sales decrease, partially offset by the profitable acquisition growth.  Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. Our second quarter balance sheet includes cash of $129 million and net debt was $820 million, resulting in a one-time leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA.  We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Free cash flow in the quarter was $159 million, bringing the year-to-date cash conversion rate on net income to 118% as working capital efficiency improved during the current quarter.  During the second quarter, we made $37 million in dividend payments and spent 47 million on repurchasing approximately 221,000 shares of company stock at an average price of $212 per share. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 2023, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22% and capital expenditures of approximately $45 million to $50 million. We'll now turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thanks, Joe. Going into fiscal 2023, we knew we would be dealing with a dynamic environment. As the year progresses, we gain better visibility through our customers. And I would now like to provide an update of what we are seeing in our end markets. In the Industrial Precision Solutions segment, we continue to see steady demand in industrial and consumer non-durable product lines. Investments continue to be made in automotive product lines, notably electric vehicles. We're also seeing continuing strength in our polymer processing product lines related to recycling and battery applications. These diverse end markets and applications combined with our direct sales and the combination of both systems and parts revenue is driving the strong year-to-date profitable growth for this segment, which Joe reviewed.  Turning to the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, we continue to experience double digit growth in our interventional solutions product lines and the backlog is strong. These products include balloons, cannulas and catheters that are integrated into medical devices for a variety of procedures, including heart valve replacement, stent delivery, angioplasties, and ECMO for blood oxygenation.  The fluid solution product lines within the MFS segment serve a diverse set of end markets, including industrial, construction, electronics assembly, animal health and medical. The construction and electronics assembly end markets within this product line continue to see soft demand, particularly in Asia and Europe.  Finally, in the MFS segment, our medical fluid component product lines which makes single use plastic connectors, stopcocks and valves for the medical and biopharmaceutical markets. Over the past two years, this division benefited from strong double digit organic growth in biopharma applications. As we shared in the last quarter, our customers in this end market are continuing to work through inventory destocking. As this business normalizes, the patient care applications within fluid components, such as blood pressure cuffs and IV bags remain stable. That said, the normalization within the biopharma market continues to provide a significant growth headwind for this segment.  Within the Advanced Technology Solutions segment, we're in the midst of the downside of electronic cycle. This has impacted sales in our electronics dispense and CyberOptics product lines. We firmly believe in the long-term growth of the electronics end market. We have not yet seen the benefits from investments related to the CHIPS Act, as we all know that the investment in automation, memory and electronic new product innovation will continue.  While the teams took targeted actions to adjust cost structure for current volumes, we remain invested in product innovation that will serve this end market. Growth in our X-Ray test and inspection product lines are successfully muting the historic volatility of this cycle. Even in the downside of the cycle, customers continue to invest in T&I systems to ensure quality and efficiency in their manufacturing lines. Our CyberOptics acquisition has more exposure to the memory end market, so its product lines have experienced weakness. Regardless, we remain excited about the long-term growth opportunities in the optical end market, and we are pleased with the ongoing integration of this business. I remind investors the past two years this segment delivered 17% organic growth on average. This multiple quarter dip is simply the cycle of semiconductor capital expenditures and we continue to be encouraged by our differentiated technology serving this long-term attractive growth market.  Overall, the diversification of the Nordson product portfolio end market and geographic exposure enables sustainable profitable growth. However, we are in a period where two divisions are seeing significant market corrections, semiconductor equipment and biopharma connectors. The remaining nine divisions or approximately 80% of Nordson is delivering 5% organic growth year-to-date at targeted incremental profit levels.  Considering the combination of these end market headwinds and tailwinds as well as current order entry, we are maintaining our previously provided 2023 revenue guidance of 0% to 3% growth over fiscal 2022 and narrowing our adjusted earnings to the range of $8.90 to $9.30. Looking specifically at the quarterly sales and earnings split, Q2 2023 was stronger than anticipated, as some sales previously forecasted for Q3 were pulled into Q2. Therefore, we're now forecasting third quarter fiscal 2023 sales to be comparable to the prior year third quarter. Third quarter earnings are forecasted in the range of $2.20 to $2.35 per share. We expect fourth quarter sales to be the strongest of the year, increasing low to mid single digits over the prior year fourth quarter.  Our full year guidance range sustains our record 2022 sales performance, which is a testament to our dedicated employees, our customer-focused business model, the diversification of our end markets, and the solid execution of NBS Next and the Ascend strategy. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support.  With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Jeff. Joe Kelley : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : I just want to focus on the biopharma piece. I know you talked about inventory destocking. I think you had thought maybe by 2Q it'd be wrapping up, but it sounds like it is lingering. So just trying to get a better sense of your visibility for that business to kind of either hit easier comps or re-inflect positive? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Overall, I would start with biopharma secular growth drivers all intact. There is no negative impact to what we have always thought about this business. So this is a strong, high single digit growth business. In terms of this short-term destocking, what we had expected was maybe we would be in the second quarter recovering from it, but it doesn't look like it as we have indicated. Our expectations are by the end of this year, we should be back to normalized order patterns from our customers. And so also by this time, you would have the comps -- the growth comps would also be anniversaried by that time. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then can you give us a little more color on where you saw the systems pull forward in terms of segment or business detail? And then just a little more color on your level of visibility for that strong fourth quarter ramp? Thanks. Joe Kelley : Yes. Jeff, I guess as it relates to the second part of that question, the visibility, what I would tell you is our backlog remains at a very elevated level, near $1 billion. But the mix is very different. If you think about our business and our backlog pre-COVID, we typically ran with a backlog that was 80% to 90% of quarterly sales. But today, I would tell you, 65% of our business has roughly normalized where the backlog is about 1% of quarterly sales. But there's 35% of our business where the backlog remains elevated, I'd call it 2.5 quarters worth of sales in backlog. And the majority of this is our large systems business, particularly in the coatings and plastics processing, which to answer your question is in the IPS segment. Here, these are discrete large system orders where we have customer prepayments and we have clear visibility to customer requests dates. That being said, they can't move depending on the customer request dates and our ability to ship within the quarters. The remainder of the heavy backlog is in our medical interventional solutions business. And here, these are large blanket orders placed by our customers for spec in product. And then they routinely communicate delivery quantities. So when you think about it and our strong Q4, it's predominantly driven by these heavy systems businesses where we do have backlog. But it could fluctuate on any given quarter. As you saw here in Q2, some of the IPS, the coatings particularly and the coatings and the plastic processing, which was quite strong, the plastic processing was where we saw the pull in from Q3 to Q2. And so that's -- it's really the large systems business within IPS that's driving our clear visibility, I would say, to Q4 and customer timing, but also results in our ability to pull in or push out on any given quarter for these large systems. Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me add something to that color is that we feel really strong about the systems businesses, as Joe indicated. It is also a strong testament of NBS Next growth framework in action. What you find here is that the businesses are truly focused on our best products and have the agility and flexibility to respond to customer demand in a market leading way, so we feel really, really strongly about it. And we also feel good about our medical intervention of business, which is showing some pretty strong strength. I would say those two things drive our optimism for the fourth quarter. Jeff Hammond : Okay. I appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joe Kelley : Good morning. Saree Boroditsky : So I guess first, the weakness in ATS obviously it's been well telegraphed. But there's also a lot of government funding going towards semis. You mentioned a little bit about the CHIPS Act. So when would you start to see that benefit? And then how long do we think about this down cycle given that? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. The way to think about it, if you look at historical semi cycles, expect that -- the normal cycle expects about four quarters of downturn. And so we are in quarter two is really where we are. So what we expect is somewhere middle of next year for sure we'll be in a place where this expenditures start to come back, the CapEx expenditures start to come back. Our conversations with our customers are pretty bullish about the long-term prospects for this business. As you know, given geopolitical considerations, given that CHIPS Act is going to come in, what you find our businesses benefit from CapEx expenditures that are allocated from these kind of investments our customers are making are typically towards the end of their construction. So right now people are constructing plans, they would eventually start putting in equipment, ours would come in at sort of the back end of that expenditure that goes towards packaging of semiconductors. That's where you would see us benefit. Saree Boroditsky : That's helpful. Then thinking with ATS, margins there have been rather volatile. I know some of this is mix related. But what is normalized mix? And how do we think about margins here into 2024 and over the long term? Joe Kelley : Yes. Saree, when you think about the ATS business, as I mentioned in the quarter, we were responding as you saw to the lower volumes for semiconductor. And some of those cost actions were structural in nature, which will help us going forward in terms of the margin profile. But a portion of that I would tell you at the consolidated level over 100 basis points was the impact of responding to the lower volumes both in semiconductor and in the medical fluid components business. But specifically, on the ATS segment, when you think about the profitability, over the last several years, that has improved quite significantly from let's just say 11% operating profit margins up to ending last year at 29%. So right now, running at these volumes, it's roughly 19% in the quarter. And that's how I would think about it for this year at these volumes with this mix. Saree Boroditsky : And as you think about 2024, is there anything like mix related that we think about benefitting or is it really a question of volume at this point? Joe Kelley : Yes, I see no reason as we recover that we wouldn't get back to the '22 tight margins for this segment. Saree Boroditsky : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Dankert from Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Dankert : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. As I look at the guide for fiscal third quarter here, the reason for the comp below seasonal sales expectation, is it just the timing of backlog, is it that semis are actually getting weaker? Just can you kind of give us a little more color around how to think about that third quarter sales guide? Joe Kelley : Yes. As it relates to the semiconductor, and we've commented, order entry appears to have leveled off as it relates to those particular product lines. And so while we saw a sequential deterioration in semiconductor sales, the guide for Q3 does not imply further sequential deterioration from the Q2 levels for semiconductor specifically. It is the timing issue between Q3 and Q4. And actually Q2 is predominantly on those large systems sales, Chris, particularly in the plastics and in the coatings space where we do have the backlog. And there were cases where some got pulled forward. I would estimate roughly about 10 million got pulled forward from Q3 into Q2. And now roughly speaking, probably 10 million got pushed out from Q3 to Q4. That's how I would think about the guide. Chris Dankert : Got it. That's very, very helpful. And then maybe just kind of a housekeeping thing here. Could you quickly remind us about the mix within that MFS segment in the interventional versus life sciences versus EFD, I think there's a little bit of confusion there? Joe Kelley : Yes. So the way I would think about that is you're correct. So there's the medical biopharma, which is roughly I would tell you $100 million business and then there's the interventional solution which is roughly $300 million annual business. And then the remainder is your EFD, which is your fluid dispense. And as a reminder, that business serves a diverse set of end markets, some of which are medical, some of which are construction, some of which are industrial, and some of which are actually electronics; electronics assembly, some semiconductor. And so it's a very diverse set of end markets served by that business. And so in the quarter, we saw significant strength in the medical interventional solutions business, as Naga has mentioned, and that order entry there continues to be strong. Growth is strong. The biopharma has been talked about, but within that EFD business, I will tell you the electronics semiconductor component of that was pressured within the quarter and contributed to the performance. Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me add some little bit more color to the fluid components business. Of those 100 million, not all of it is biopharma. A portion of it is biopharma. But you also have other medical fluid connector applications in that business. And so what you find is biopharma is the one that is sort of normalizing. But you have other connectors that have been pretty stable. But the biopharma normalization was fairly significant to show up at the division level. And as I indicated in one of my answers, we expect that this normalizes by the end of the year. Chris Dankert : That's helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. Just to put a finer point on third quarter EPS guidance relative to last year, roughly a $0.20 delta on flat revenue, currency is going to be probably a somewhat material tailwind in the quarter. Can you kind of parse out what's driving the year-over-year reduction in earnings on flat sales? Joe Kelley : Yes. There's two components also to that earnings guide. One is interest expense is clearly up on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. On the full year, it's going to be up about 20 million. So that contributes. And then also last year, there was some FX hedged gains in the quarter, which benefited, which are not forecasted to repeat. And so those are below the OP, which I would tell you are having an impact on the year-over-year earnings guide. Sundaram Nagarajan : Sorry, Matt. Just to add, I think it's important to remember that in the quarter, we delivered 31% EBITDA margins, so about all of these above the line. Operationally, while the earnings are pretty strong at 31%, our expectation is that we are at that level going into the second half of the year. Matt Summerville : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just spend a minute, Naga, talking about any sort of evolution in your M&A funnel backlog relative to coming out of last quarter, how you're thinking about actionability, et cetera, therein? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Our acquisition pipeline remains healthy. We continue to work on projects. Our focus areas remain the same, which is sort of continuing to expand our test in inspection, continuing to add to any core businesses around dispensing if we run into that, or continuing to scale up our medical businesses. So those three things strategically have not changed. Pipeline, pretty healthy, but we remain financially disciplined. And we've talked about those criteria. And so we continue to work it. But you're going to expect to see us be disciplined, but our work continues. So there is -- I can only tell you that this is top of mind and it's an important piece of our growth strategy. Just as a reminder, we committed to delivering $500 million in acquisitions for over the plan period, and we have acquired up to $225 million in revenues already, and fully expect that we will deliver on that $500 million in the plan period. And so good work and we have demonstrated we are flexible in type of deals we're able to do. We have completed CyberOptics, which is sort of a public company deal. Last year, we did a public company carve out, but we remain invested in this process and feel good about where we are. Matt Summerville : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Mike. Joe Kelley : Good morning. Mike Halloran : So a couple here. First, how are you guys thinking about backlog normalization still very elevated? It sounds like you don't expect that to get more normalized until probably next year. And then related, any -- in your guidance, is there any change in the assumptions for underlying demand at this point from current levels? Or is the run rate you're seeing kind of what's embedded in the guide from here out? Joe Kelley : Yes. I guess let me take the first part on the backlog question, Mike. I would tell you, if you look at 65% of our business, that backlog is getting close to historical pre-COVID levels. If you say pre-COVID levels, we ran this business at about 80% to 90% of quarterly sales in backlog heading into any given quarter. For 65% of our business, we're at about one quarter worth in the backlog. So it's almost at historical levels. The piece that hasn't reverted and I don't know that it is going to revert to historical practices is about 35% of our businesses, which is the large systems business, the coatings business, the plastics business, and the medical interventional solution business. There where we continue to have backlog at an elevated level, orders continue to be strong and it's about 2.5 quarters worth of backlog that we're running in those businesses. And so we're not seeing that portion of our business revert to historical norms, while the remainder is. Mike Halloran : And the second part of the question then. Joe Kelley : Sorry. Could you repeat the second part of the question please? Mike Halloran : Just within the guide, is there any assumption for improvement or deterioration underlying fundamentals avoiding backlog normalization noted in the guide? Joe Kelley : Yes. So if you look at our assumption on order entry, we do feel that it has stabilized at the level we saw that stabilization throughout Q2. And so we continue to -- the guide assumes that we remain at these levels. And then what you have within the quarters is the timing of the systems deliveries. And so that's what drives the quarterly fluctuations. Mike Halloran : Sounds good. And then within the medical business, the fluid business there, should that just correlate more with ATF at a high level on a forward basis? And how are you guys thinking about the normalization of that piece? Because within the biopharma piece, you've given a lot of context to the other parts of that medical side of things you're feeling pretty healthy about. So just more of the timing on that remaining piece and how you think about that normalizing? Sundaram Nagarajan : The biopharma is part of MFS, I would say, normalizes by the end of the year, right? And so going into next year, we are back to the 7%, 8% year-on-year growth. That's our expectation for our medical and fluid component business. And as you think about ATS, that's going to be a little bit in the middle of 2024. So our fluid components comes in first, our APS business comes in next. And some of this is normalization of comps too. Mike Halloran : No. Naga, I think you mentioned that earlier in the call. I was more specifically referring to the parts of that segment that are working construction, the optimizing, et cetera, type pieces. Sundaram Nagarajan : Okay. Joe, do you want to take -- Joe Kelley : Yes. The management piece of MFS that's not on the medical interventional and not on the medical fluid components side, that piece of the business EFD I would tell you roughly half of that business has the exposure and market exposure similar to our broad ATS segment. And the other half is more industrial, construction, there's animal health, there's medical. So that's how we think about it. Sundaram Nagarajan : And then -- Mike Halloran : Go ahead. Sorry, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Sorry, Mike. So for the portion that has the electronics and construction exposure in Asia, you are right. We got to think about it like the ATS. Mike Halloran : Great, I appreciate it. Last question, you guys mentioned some actions internally to normalize for demand. Is there any way you could quantify what those cost actions look like? Or are you thinking about more just run rates with demand and helps mitigate what those detrimental margins would look like? Joe Kelley : Yes. The cost actions in the quarter were 3.5 million roughly to respond very focused actions within the MFS segment and the ATS segment to adjust our cost structure. I will tell you some of those, Mike, were structural not just the [indiscernible] piece. But we did take some structural cost reduction actions, particularly in ATS that will help benefit that segment as profitability recovers back to historical level let's just say in '24. And so the savings generated within the quarter -- within the year will offset the 3.5 million. Mike Halloran : Great. I really appreciate it. Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Mike, I know you didn't ask this question. But one thing I would remind all of us is that, yes, the business is adjusting to the market demand. And I think that was the right thing for us to do. But I keep in front of mind for all of you that we stay invested in our customer-centric business model, in our product innovation, in NBS Next deployment. So this is really important of making sure the company is well positioned as we adjust for the short-term headwinds, is well positioned for long-term continued growth. More than 80% of the business is growing. And so we want to make sure we stay invested in innovation, stay invested in our customer experience. So that we do well in those parts, but also even in the parts where we have some short-term headwinds, we are invested in innovation. Mike Halloran : Thanks, Naga. And maybe next call, we'll have a smoother back and forth. I won't cut you off. Sundaram Nagarajan : That's okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joe Kelley : Good morning, Al. Allison Poliniak : Naga, I'm starting to get some questions on China's Micron ban. Just any comments or color on flow through to you guys or any risks that you guys see there. Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Micron is somebody that we work with in our optical business. We are focused more on the long term, because as Micron expects its capacity in other places, we are certainly going to benefit. As you have seen, they have made some pretty strong projections on where they're investing here in North America. So as I think about this, we're going to benefit from alternate investments they make in capacity. So as you, Nordson benefits when people add new lines, expand capacity or make alternative investments. So I feel like, yes, that might have a pressure on their questions on what their investment. But I think long term, the way you want to think about this is this is another reason why they would want to expand their capability. Yes, there may be some impact on their volumes in China. But we're not -- our business is not impacted by volume of chips manufactured. In a lot of ways, we are very close -- our customer-centric business model allows us to stay in touch with our customers in a very close way, and allows us to understand where they're headed and what we're doing. So this is pretty new news. This is probably we thinking about how does it impact us in the long term? Allison Poliniak : Understood. Thanks. And then you made a comment, IPS generating better growth and execution the main thing you had laid out at the Analyst meeting. Just want to understand kind of where the surprise was for you in terms of that division, will it sort of be development of products, is it execution, just get a better sense on how sustainable you think that is going forward? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, I think there are a couple of things that I'd like to point to. First, I'll point to that each of our businesses have been thinking about our NBS Next growth framework and have been using what we call internally strategic discipline. Strategic discipline really is about understanding the best growth opportunities and doubling down on those best growth opportunities. So what you begin to see here is a concerted effort by all of our divisions to be focused on the best growth opportunities. Definitely, they benefit from some macro secular trends that we are pretty excited about, first in terms of onshoring or reshoring or [indiscernible], whatever you want to call it, what you find is our customers beginning to add capacity moving away from Asia and investing more closer to home, we suddenly benefit from it. So that is an important one. The other thing that we're benefiting from in this business is that there are a number of emerging electric vehicle applications that are -- electric vehicle as well as battery manufacturing continues to evolve. So I wouldn't say this is fully solidified yet. But these new applications certainly help us and help the company play in some new applications we have not had opportunities, but strategic discipline kind of brings all of that into focus for the business, allows them to invest there. So those would be the two things that I would point to. Certainly execution inside the business in terms of our factory dedication to our best products is certainly also playing out. So in the businesses we have realistically implemented NBS Next, you're starting to see a significantly better customer service that is market leading. So I would point to those three things as sort of where we see how NBS Next is helping our teams deliver on growth opportunities. Allison Poliniak : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Walt Liptak from Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Walt. Walter Liptak : Maybe as a follow on to the last couple of questions using NBS Next with these strategic disciplines. In the ATS segment, I think you guys have been working on trying to broaden some of the applications from traditional semiconductor electronics to automotive sensors, IoT, things like that. And I wonder if there's a metric that you're looking at now, or if there's something that you tell us about sort of the fruits of that effort? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Within the business, we have got like four targeted KPIs that we measure, which sort of gives us a view of how we are doing in terms of deploying NBS Next and we call it leadership level performance. So we have leadership level performance on customer growth is one of the key metrics for the business within the company. And what you're beginning to see is where businesses that are not impacted by significant macro trends, that metric is trending towards where we would like to be, right, and it differs from business to business. So I can't give you a specific number. But what I will tell you is business by business, the teams are identifying what is leadership level performance and we are beginning to see some nice progress in businesses on customer growth, certainly on new product innovation. And there are a couple of other metrics around customer service levels that we are very excited about. So number of internal metrics that allows us to track the effectiveness of the strategy deployment and execution that is leading to some pretty strong customer experience that we believe translates into growth and profitable growth for the company. Walter Liptak : Okay. All right, great. That's helpful. And then just switching over to IPS, again, the 9% organic, I wonder if you could help us understand how much of that was volume growth and how much was price? Joe Kelley : Yes. Walt, this is Joe. I would tell you that the price realization for Nordson broadly improved in Q2, and so I would estimate that approximately 4% of that 9% for IPS segment would be attributed to price and 4% would be volume. Walter Liptak : And then -- Joe Kelley : Sorry, go ahead. Walter Liptak : And the 60% incremental margins looked really good too. Is there NBS Next in there, so we're now operating at a higher level or is that just catch up on some of the price cost? Joe Kelley : No, I would tell you that NBS Next expressing itself on the price cost, we got to the point where I would tell you that that is no longer a headwind. If you'll recall the last two quarters that's been pressuring our gross margins. And so here, that is price cost balanced for Nordson is no longer pressuring the gross margins as we have realized the price increase to offset inflation and maintain our margins. So what you'll see there in the 6% incremental margin for IPS is largely consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of years. And I would tell you, there's a host of issues there, but it's the benefit of NBS Next and being broadly implemented throughout those divisions. Walter Liptak : Okay. Congratulations on that. Thank you. Joe Kelley : I would like to make one other comment, I think it's back to Matt's question around the Q3 guide. I spoke to what was assumed in the guide below operating profit. But when you look at the operating profit line and the gross margin line, our gross margins were at roughly 54.5% here in Q2 consistent with Q1. That being said, the drivers of that were a little bit different than Q1. The price realization is no longer a headwind. But what you see in Q2, the margins are pressured by the lower volumes that we've talked about on those two particular businesses. And then offsetting that is the growth but the growth is coming with a less favorable sales mix as it's becoming and coming in product lines such as plastic processing and others who are delivering double digit growth. So the profitability when you think about Q2 going into Q3, profitability from gross margin and OP margin should be comparable because the mix is comparable. Operator : We have no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Naga for closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Our performance reflects the strength of our differentiated precision technology, customer-centric model, and diversified end markets. Again, I want to thank Nordson's employees for their commitment which makes these results possible. The continued deployment of NBS Next in the Ascend strategy will position us well for long-term growth. We look forward to the opportunity to talk with you at upcoming investor events. Joe, Lara and Stephen Lovass, our MFS segment leader, will be at the Deutsche Bank Industrial conference on June 8 in New York. Joe, Lara and Jeff Pembroke, our IPS segment leader, will be at the Wells Fargo Industrial conference on June 13 in Chicago. And Joe, Lara and our segment leader of ATS, Srini Subramanian, will be participating in a Virtual Roadshow with Loop Capital on June 14.  Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Joseph Kelley, Executive Vice President and CFO. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, August 22 to report Nordson's fiscal 2023 third quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Tuesday, August 29, 2023. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric was provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss third quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. Joe will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will then share a high-level commentary about our enterprise performance. He will conclude with an update on the fiscal 2023 full-year and fourth quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2023 third quarter conference call. While sales were at the low-end of our expected guidance range for the quarter, I would like to recognize the dedicated Nordson team who has actively controlled cost in divisions where it was necessary and leverage the NBS Next growth framework to deliver strong growth in divisions where the market demand was strong. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.35, which was at the high-end of our third quarter EPS guidance. Going into the third quarter, we expected to be pressured by the ongoing weakness in our electronics and biopharma product lines. We understand the macro factors impacting these end markets and we have line of sight to returning to growth. This quarter's electronics end-market softness is particularly visible when looking at our results in Asia Pacific, which declined 20%. This reflects decreased demand from semiconductor customers in our ATS segment and electronics assembly customers in our MFS segment. These markets are cyclical, and we anticipate them turning in the middle of 2024. The diversification of our business offset some of this pressure. From a product perspective, we continue to experience double-digit organic growth in medical interventional solutions and polymer processing product lines, as well as high-single-digit growth in the test and inspection business. Regionally, we experienced mid-single-digit organic growth in both Americas and Europe, as our customers in both these regions are rebalancing their supply chains to be closer to the markets they serve. I'll speak more about the enterprise and our exciting new acquisition of ARAG in few moments, but first, I'll turn the call over to Joe to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results of the quarter. Joseph Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 5, you'll see third quarter fiscal 2023 sales were $649 million, a decrease of 2% compared to the prior year's third quarter sales of $662 million. This was driven by an organic decrease of 5%, partially offset by the favorable benefit of the CyberOptics acquisition. During the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by the end-market pressures that Naga referenced. Gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 totaled $360 million. Excluding severance cost, gross profit totaled $362 million or 56% of sales, which is comparable to the prior year third quarter. SG&A in the third quarter was elevated to a $189 million above the $181 million we have been averaging for the last six quarters. Third quarter SG&A was impacted by notable non-recurring items that I'd like to highlight. Our teams advanced two separate $1 billion global acquisition targets through the comprehensive due diligence process all the way to the final stages. As a result of these two significant and strategic projects, we incurred $7 million in non-recurring cost from third-party service providers. We ultimately chose to move forward only with ARAG, which included an additional $1 million for the fairness opinion. In total, we incurred $8 million in non-recurring cost for acquisition-related activity in the third quarter. Operating profit, excluding these non-recurring items, was $181 million in the quarter or 28% of sales, 4% below the prior year adjusted operating profit of $188 million. Despite the lower sales volume, we held on to decremental margins on adjusted operating profit of 56%, reflective of our cost controls and improved pricing, which can be attributed to our team's dedication to the NBS Next framework. As we execute the Ascend strategy and scale through strategic acquisitions, EBITDA remains the key profitability metric. EBITDA for the third quarter was $208 million or 32% of sales, which is above our long-term profitability target, however, $5 million or 2% below the prior year EBITDA of $213 million. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volume in the quarter. Looking at non-operating expenses, interest expense increased $6 million associated with higher borrowings and increase interest rates. Other net expense decreased $2 million related to a combination of changes in pension and deferred compensation plans, as well as foreign exchange gains and losses. Tax expense was $34 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is in line with the prior year third quarter rate and the forecasted full-year rate for 2023. Net income in the quarter totaled $128 million or $2.22 per share. Adjusted earnings per share excluding non-recurring acquisition and severance cost totaled $2.35 per share, a 6% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings. The decrease was primarily driven by higher interest expense and lower operating profit. Now let's turn to Slide 6 through 8 to review the third quarter 2023 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $338 million decreased 1% compared to the prior year third quarter, driven by softness in our product assembly and nonwovens product lines in Asia. This was partially offset by continued strength in polymer processing product lines and growth in the Americas and Europe. Year-to-date, the IPS segments has delivered 3% organic sales growth following two consecutive years of double-digit growth. EBITDA for the quarter was $122 million or 36% of sales, which is a decrease of 3% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $126 million. The biggest driver of the decrease is lower sales volume and unfavorable sales mix due to the higher sales volume and polymer processing product lines. EBITDA in the current quarter has improved compared to the prior two quarters of the current year and year-to-date is $4 million higher than the prior year. On Slide 7, you'll see Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $171 million decreased 4% compared to the prior year's third quarter. The decrease was driven by continued softness in the medical fluid components division related to destocking in single-use plastic components for biopharma applications and fluid solutions product lines specifically for electronics assembly primarily in Asia Pacific. This pressure was partially offset by double-digit growth in our medical interventional solutions product lines. Third quarter EBITDA was $68 million or 40% of sales, which is a decrease of $8 million compared to the prior year EBITDA of $76 million. EBITDA continued to be impacted by meaningful sales mix changes within medical product lines. It is noteworthy that the segment EBITDA margin sequentially improved 200 basis points over the second quarter of 2023 and back to the profitability levels this segment delivered in 2021 and 2022. Turning to Slide 8, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales were $140 million, a 3% decrease compared to the prior year third quarter. During the quarter, the CyberOptics acquisition contributed 11% growth. Organic sales volume was down 13%. The organic decrease was driven by electronics dispense product line, serving the semiconductor end markets, predominantly in Asia Pacific, slightly offset by continued growth in test and inspection products. The cyclical downturn of demand in the semiconductor market will anniversary in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which aligns with the historic downcycles lasting approximately four to five quarters. Structural cost reduction actions were taken during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to address the volume decrease in electronics dispense products. For example, they've chosen to outsource their fabrication shop to focus on more value-added precision dispense technology, resulting in a $2 million of non-recurring severance cost. Third quarter EBITDA was $33 million or 24% of sales, which was an improvement compared to the prior year third quarter EBITDA of $30 million. The improvement in EBITDA during the quarter was driven by favorable sales mix and continued realization of cost savings actions. Despite the double-digit organic sales volume decrease, this segment is delivering quarterly profitability only 100 basis points below 2022 levels. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 9. We had a very strong cash flow quarter, generating $181 million in free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date cash conversion rate on net income to 126%. Cash ended the quarter at $143 million and net debt was $695 million, resulting in a 0.9 times leverage ratio based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities such as our upcoming acquisition of ARAG. We expect to close the ARAG acquisition by the end of August and exit the year with a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 2 times. During the third quarter, we repaid $111 million of debt, paid $37 million in dividends and spent $23 million on repurchasing approximately 107,000 shares of company stock at an average price of $217 per share. Our Board approved a 5% increase in our annual dividend, effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. This marks the 60th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend, an impressive accomplishment only enabled by maintaining a truly differentiated precision technology portfolio and serving diverse end markets. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 2023, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22% and capital expenditures of approximately $35 million to $40 million, as several of our investment timelines have pushed out. With our upcoming acquisition of ARAG, I want to provide you with some assumptions for modeling purposes. For revenue, assume approximately $20 million to $30 million in fiscal '23. EBITDA margins are expected in the high-30% range. We expect ARAG to be slightly dilutive to GAAP EPS in Q4 2023 due to increased amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and interest expense associated with the acquisition. Excluding acquisition costs and related intangible amortization, EPS should be neutral for the fourth quarter. Due to the expeditious nature of the close, the acquisition will initially be financed with a short-term loan and revolver borrowings. We anticipate following up with a bond issuance in the public markets later this year, and we are currently working through the ratings process. Based on current market conditions, assume a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.5% for total Nordson debt in 2024. We will now turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thanks, Joe. Our team continues to execute the Ascend strategy, which is clear in the strong profitability delivered in this quarter. While we are managing the short-term sales weakness related to the biopharma end-market and electronic cycle, we're getting closer to anniversarying that pressure in fiscal 2024. Related to the biopharma product lines in our medical fluid components division, we believe we have seen the bottom of the customers' unique supply chain destocking trend and will anniversary this pressure in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Following this period, we cautiously expect the medical fluid components business to return to its historical mid to high single-digit growth rate over time. Moving onto electronics end markets. I visited our Electronics Processing Solutions leadership team in Carlsbad, California earlier this month. Our team's expectation is that electronics CapEx spend cycle will begin to turn in the second half of the calendar 2024. We expect to benefit from customer investments in automation, memory, AI and electronics new product innovation. In the meantime, this division is successfully managing costs, while staying invested in profitable growth opportunities identified through the NBS Next growth framework. In fact, the EPS division exceeded its targeted decremental margins during this low-volume period. We also continued to be pleased with the growth of our test and inspection division, which mutes the volatility of the electronic cycle. Geographically, we are closely monitoring the pressure in Asia Pacific region, specifically in China. The regional sales weakness was largely related to the electronics exposure, though there was weakness in demand across all three segments, some of which was due to the timing of large system orders. Nordson has a well-established footprint in China with long-tenured and knowledgeable employees. We will remain close to our customers and support them appropriately. Simultaneously, Nordson's business model positions us well to support customers, if they decide to diversify their supply chain to other regions of Asia or into the Americas and Europe. Our customer intimate business model ensures we are prepared to fully participate as global supply chains rebalance. Finally, I'd like to share an update on the Ascend strategy. Acquisitions are a very important part of our goal to achieve $3 billion in revenue by 2025. Of the $500 million acquired revenue target we set at our 2021 Investor Day, we are now nearly 80% of the way there. In June, we announced the acquisition of ARAG, a global market and innovation leader in precision spraying technology. Precision dispense technology is core to Nordson. Over nearly 70 years, we have expanded that expertise beyond our beginnings in industrial applications into dispense for packaging, product assembly, non-wovens, electronics, medical and more. Through it all, we adhered to disciplined strategic acquisition criteria, differentiated technology generated Nordson-like gross margins, high-growth end-market applications and the customer-centric business model. The acquisition of ARAG meets all of these criteria and expands our technology expertise into the high-growth end-market of precision agriculture, and is the largest single acquisition in our history. Today, ARAG is the market leader in precision agriculture technology in Europe and South America. ARAG fluid components are sold to implement manufacturers, who in turn sell to the tractor manufacturers or OEMs. ARAG closely works with all of the customers within these channels to ensure its innovation pipeline, supports the customers' goals of improving crop yields and minimizing the use of expensive fertilizers and chemicals. It is also important to note that over 40% of ARAG's revenue is recurring aftermarket sales sold through distributors. We were attracted to the continued growth opportunity in ARAG's existing geographic markets. The opportunity to invest and grow ARAG's technology in North America presents an attractive proposition beyond the existing core market growth, upon which we valued the company. I'm very excited about the ARAG acquisition and the long-term profitable growth opportunities in our business. We have a winning team, who is focused on the customer and managing through unique market headwinds, while delivering solid profitability and cash flow. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year on Slide 12. We are narrowing our previously provided 2023 revenue guidance to 0% to 2% growth over record fiscal 2022 and narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance to $8.90 to $9.05. Looking specifically at the quarterly sales and earnings split on Slide 13, we expect fourth quarter sales to be the strongest of the year, increasing low to mid-single-digits over the prior year fourth quarter at the midpoint. This guidance includes approximately $20 million to $30 million of sales from the ARAG acquisition that we expect to close in late August. Fourth quarter earnings are forecasted in the range of $2.34 to $2.49 per share. Embedded in our forecast is strong profitability and cash conversion performance, which is a result of Nordson's operational excellence, a clear competitive advantage created through the execution of the Ascend strategy by winning teams with an owner mindset. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Jeff. Joseph Kelley : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So, just really want to unpack the guidance change. I mean, I hear kind of Asia Pac and electronics kind of weaker and then the ARAG impact. So maybe just unpack kind of what drives the lower-end. And it seemed like the revenue was lighter in 3Q, but 4Q seems kind of in line, but maybe just a little more help on the moving pieces. Thanks. Joseph Kelley : Yes. So let me take a start with that Jeff, if I could. So at the midpoint of the guide, it's roughly 3.5% growth. And so, when you think about that for Q4, the acquisition should contribute about 6%, FX will be favorable, about 2.5% and from an organic standpoint, it's negative 5%, which is consistent with what we just delivered here in Q3. And then when you think about the range, I appreciate on the ARAG acquisition, the timing of the actual close will contribute to that. And the first two months post-acquisition, we have that range there of $20 million (ph) to $30 million. So that drive some volatility, I would say, or flex expands the range on the revenue guidance a little bit there. The other is -- as I would tell you is the timing of some large system shipments. Q4 last year was our strongest quarter of the year as you recall, and Q4 this year is forecasted to be the same. And so, there are large system deliveries in there. And so, sometimes those get pushed and pulled out, so that contributes to little bit to the how wide the range is on revenue. And from an end-market standpoint, Naga, you can comment. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. From an end-market perspective, if you think about the three segments, IPS, we feel pretty good about where we are at in comparison to our long-term, as well as sequentially. We expect this system to continue to be at or above our long-term growth rate. So that's what is embedded in the growth. Suddenly, electronics and biopharma continuing at the levels they are today, we don't expect them to recover here in the fourth quarter. They certainly are our expectation, and we'll talk a little bit more about it later. In that electronics, we expect sometime in middle of calendar 2024 is when we expect that to turn and biopharma sometime in the first quarter of 2024 is when we anniversary, but the growth on biopharma is going to be, as I indicated in my initial comments, that is going to be -- we're going to be cautious here as to when that fully recovers to its high single-digits kind of growth rate. But nothing in biopharma long-term secular trends have been impacted. So we fully expect we will get to it. It is just a matter of how long it takes for us to get back to it. And then if you think about our medical IS business, that is growing double-digits. We fully expect that in the fourth quarter, we continue to do so. Our polymer processing businesses are doing incredibly well, and they are expected to do well in the next quarter. And we've got a couple of system businesses that are -- that have strong backlog we expect to do well as well. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just some housekeeping questions on the ARAG deal one. So I think you said high-30s EBITDA margins. Just wondering what -- if you've done the purchase accounting, what the D&A component is that would kind of get you to -- to an kind of ongoing operating margin for that business in -- at least in year-one. And then just a clarification on the interest expense at 5.5% is weighted for the total company, or is that for the ARAG deal and if so, just kind of how to think about the interest cost associated with funding ARAG would be? Thanks. Joseph Kelley : Yeah. So let me take a stab at that, Jeff. First of all, on the purchase accounting, we'll hold off and I'll give some clear guidance on that when we do our full-year 2024. And so, right now, the guide with the amortization just is really looking at historical trends for acquisitions of this nature and a percentage of the purchase price, but we will firm that up, when we issue the 2024 guide for Nordson, which will include purchase accounting assumptions on ARAG. On the interest expense, given the current market conditions, depending on where the bonds will price later this year, our estimate currently is that total Nordson interest expense will be roughly 5% to 5.5% based on current market conditions. And that's for our weighted basket of debt. Jeff Hammond : And what would -- what would that have been kind of pre the bond offering, or pre-ARAG? Joseph Kelley : If you look from a year-to-date standpoint, we're slightly below 5% in terms of our weighted average interest cost. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Appreciate it. I'll get back in queue. Joseph Kelley : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Allison Poliniak : Hi. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joseph Kelley : Good morning. Allison Poliniak : I want to go back to your comments on China. Is there any way that -- I know there are some cyclical aspects to it, but you did talk to sort of maybe potentially structural. Are you starting to see some, I would say, industry minimizing that region because you did talk about maybe the offsets in other regions for you? Just -- I don't know if there's any way to decide or what you're seeing in terms of the cyclical versus structural over there at this point. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. If you think about China itself, right, a majority of our electronic businesses -- if you look at our electronic business divisions, more than 75% of their revenues is in Asia, right? And significant part of that is in China. So if you think about our China, Asia Pac impact, what you find is the majority of the China impact is due to electronics. And so, that is more cyclical and we fully expect that it follows the cyclicality. What we -- what we do see is our major global customers. So if you think about our China exposure, our China exposure is following large international global customers to China. And we do have some mid-tier Chinese customers that we serve, but across the segments, mostly it is global customers. What we find with most of our global customers, there is some amount of rebalancing of supply chain going on, but we don't see anybody making significant moves out of China. It seems from our work with our customers in other regions, be it in North America or be it in Europe or in other parts of Asia, we do see customers building, let's say, additional capacity or new capacity in different regions other than China. So that's why you begin to see in our regional numbers a nice growth in Americas and a nice growth in Europe and a decline in Asia Pac. Asia Pac, in some ways, a big part of it is China. Japan in general is doing really well for us. It's a smaller business, but it is doing well. So, from what we can see, the majority of the decline that we see today is cyclical related to electronics. We do see some large system misses which are and could be up and down given in any quarter. So, we don't see anything structurally changing, but we do see investments happening in other places, if that makes sense. Allison Poliniak : It does. That was helpful, thanks. And then, backlog is still relatively strong. There's been a lot of supply chain rebalancing this year. Do you feel like a lot of that's out of the backlog at this point and it's really just sort of backlog growth as we look forward or projects being pushed out? Just any color on that backlog number would be great. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I'll give you some color and Joe can help me with some additional detail, but the way to think about is our backlog is so historically high. And that historically high backlog is driven by couple of system businesses and our medical interventional business, where we get longer-term orders, which kind of go into our backlog, right? So if you think about majority, about 60%, 70% of our business, we fundamentally believe our backlogs have normalized to the pre-pandemic levels. So, you can think about supply chain normalizing in 60%, 70% of the businesses, these elevated targets mainly related to large system businesses, be it our polymer processing business or our ICS business and our medical IS business, which is sort of our -- where customers give us blanket orders. Joe, would you add anything more to that? Joseph Kelley : No. I would just -- I would be just repeating what you said. I mean if you think about our backlog worth of $1 billion, it used to be balanced across all the divisions. It has migrated over the last, I would tell you six months, maybe nine months and today, it's disproportionately heavy weighted -- heavily weighted on the large systems businesses and medical IS where the remaining, which is the majority of our business has normalized to historical levels. Allison Poliniak : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville of DA Davidson. Your line is open. Matt Summerville : Yeah, thanks. Couple of questions. If we kind of think about fiscal '24 at a high level with the electronics piece seemingly turning in the second half, does that -- is that going to line up or coincide with a continued strength in T&I, or is there a little bit of give and take here? And I basically has the same question for the medical side of the business. As biopharma begins to reaccelerate, does medical interventional begin to rollover or decelerate? And I guess at the end of the day, I'm trying to conclude whether or not we can see a thinking, if you will, of organic growth between all four of those different pieces of the business, such that we see pretty good things out of Nordson towards the latter part of next year. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. So let me -- I'll give you some color around the end markets and what our expectations are, and Joe, maybe you could add some numbers next to with -- to the extent that we can. So first of all, we're not giving guidance for '24 yet. So that's the perspective I'd give you, but in terms of end-market color, Matt, that's a really good question. Our expectations in -- let me start with electronics. My expectations are that our electronic cycle sort of rebounds calendar 2024 -- middle of calendar 2024. And at that time, our expectation is that you're going to see growth both in T&I and EPS. All along, we've talked about T&I yielding the amplitude of the cycles. That's really what T&I is doing for us. It is not -- it is not like T&I is not cyclical, it's just the cycle amplitude. It's smaller in T&I when compared to EPS, based on the business, as we -- based on the customers and the end applications we serve. So clearly, ATS, from a historical perspective, is muted, but as it comes back, you're going to see EPS bounce back nicely like the traditional way we've done. But T&I will benefit from this as well. So it is not -- T&I is not going to benefit. So that is the electronic piece of it. If you think about our biopharma and medical, what you're going to find is medical has some very strong double-digit growth here for the last couple of quarters, mainly because as you're coming off of backlog and as you have elective surgery all getting back to normal. What you find is this pretty big uptick in demand for medical interventional compartments. That certainly, as we get into '24 and later, you would expect that start to go to its historical mid to high single-digits growth rate. On the biopharma, we fundamentally believe that it has bottomed out and it's sort of settling in at these current levels. By the end of first quarter, what you begin to see is we anniversary the growth rates that we have enjoyed for two years -- two full (ph) years of double-digit growth in fluid components, that anniversaries itself. But I would caution us in terms of how fast we get back to the high-single-digit growth on biopharma. We fundamentally believe we'll get there. What we are not sure right now is how long it takes for us to get to that high-single-digit growth rate. We believe nothing is impaired, but we're also cautious in terms of how fast the ramp happens. Hopefully, that gives you color on both those questions. Joe, anything else to add on the numbers? Joseph Kelley : Yeah. I would just say, Matt, when you think about it, the electronics, the EPS division is down like roughly 20%. When you study the T&I, given the diversity of that end-market, those applications, while it may go through ups and downs and it's been growing the last several years, I wouldn't anticipate a scenario -- we don't see a scenario where that's down 20%, offsetting some recovery in EPS. And similarly, I would tell you, if you go to the medical mix -- in our -- the destocking going on there in the biopharma is quite unique, where it's down 30%, 40%, whereas the medical interventional solution, yes, it's growing nice double-digits now, but if you go back during the pandemic, the COVID, that was only down in the, I would say, 10%, maybe 15%. So, it just doesn't have the magnitude of the swings that we're seeing in the current down-cycle. So, I wouldn't anticipate that to offset the recovery in those in '24. Sundaram Nagarajan : I think... Matt Summerville : Got it. Sundaram Nagarajan : And just in addition to that, I would say, is medical fluid components flattens out, maybe picks up a little bit. And our interventional component grows high-single digits is sort of how I would... Matt Summerville : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about -- it sounded like you were running two concurrent $1 billion M&A processes over the last few months. Maybe talk about what made you kind of halt or walk away from the other deal and why ARAG maybe won out over the other potential candidate? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. If you look at both the deals, we were excited strategically for both those opportunities. They fit right smack dab in the middle of where we want it to be, highly-differentiated precision technologies, very attractive growth rates in end markets we really like in places we really understand and do well and have a customer-centric business model. So strategically, both of them were exactly where we want it to be and we pursue both of them equally, yeah. And so, what really when we came down to final due diligence, we exercise financial discipline, we've always talked about, look, we first go through the strategic criteria and if we like it, we go to the next step and then when it's financially make sense for the company, has a returns we'd like, then we do it. So what I'm telling you is that, on ARAG, we hit both of them. In the other deal, in the final analysis, we couldn't get there and we were financially disciplined and so we walked away from it. Matt Summerville : Thanks, Naga. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Go ahead, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. One thing I would add, as we were talking about the end markets, Matt, in your question, the end-market challenges and the upsides and we talk about the two acquisitions. I would kind of step back and think about this quarter. And if you think about this quarter, what Nordson's team really did was have an operational excellence that kind of came through in the results. It really showed there were some challenges on the topline, but the team did an incredible job. And that showed during the bottom line, right? And one to look at it and say that's operational excellence and you could simply walk away. But from my vantage point, what really shines through is the work we've been doing inside the company around Ascend strategy and the competitive advantage we are building. And this competitive advantage of Ascend strategy really what it is, is you've got strong winning teams with an incredible owner mindset that are executing the NBS Next growth framework and delivering results, right? That's the competitive advantage we are building and that shows up in three different ways. One, it shows up in divisions where end-market conditions are challenged, the team really takes an owner mindset and figures out what kind of cost actions we need to take and deliver decremental margins that we've talked about in the 55%. Then you have a set of divisions that have strong market opportunities and really fully participating in that growth through incredible customer service and delivering really strong incremental margins, right? And then on the third side, the company not sitting idle, certainly looking at what are the growth opportunities through acquisitions. And so, the team really -- the three different themes and end of the day, that's what we're talking about here. That's in my mind is what is coming through in our results in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning, Naga and Joe, Lara. I was curious about the polymer markets, if there is any sort of interesting structural dynamics, what you're seeing in terms of a typical timing around a recap cycle or market penetration momentum? Just curious for a higher-level view of that market. Sundaram Nagarajan : What we're seeing is, this is a set of businesses that we've gone through some pretty good work around setting the business up for taking advantage of the growth opportunities. Really the biggest growth opportunity that is out there that this team is pursuing really is the recycling. And what we find is given this whole issue around plastic usage reduction, I don't know whether I go as far as to say plastic ban, but in certain parts of the world, those words get thrown around, but we do find incredible demand for recycling. And we have some unique technology in our BKG business in Germany that allows us to serve that particular market. And I would highlight that as an pretty strong secular trend that is going on. And that business has some pretty strong backlog going into next year, significant part of next year. Joseph Kelley : Chris, I would add when you think about that polymer processing you go back in time and remember the divestiture of the Xaloy business. The divestiture of that product line, I would tell you, resulted in upgrading the quality and the degree of differentiation of the product lines that remained in that polymer processing division. And so, I think that's what you see also fallen through some of these numbers. Christopher Glynn : Makes sense. Thanks. And just going back to Jeff's question on the D&A for ARAG, you referenced kind of rule of thumb metric informing the 4Q guide in terms of percentage of sales D&A. Just curious if that rule of thumb sort of correlates around 2.5%, 3% of purchase price, since you kind of put it in generic terms and also on ARAG, just the 40% through distribution, I know it's viewed as recurring, but stocking comes into question, particularly on the heels of a couple year of global supply chain volatility. So just curious how you view the inventory levels the channel kind of balances and equanimity across that stock and flow sort of business. Sundaram Nagarajan : So maybe help me. So you want to take the D&A question first, and then I can maybe make a comment around the inventory piece. Joseph Kelley : Yeah. The answer to your question is, yes, that typical 2.5% of purchase price is our starting point in terms of the annual amortization. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : And in terms of inventory, remember, the recurring revenue here are parts. They're not significant systems are big units that are sitting in our distributor shelves that takes a little bit longer time. These are small sprayers and that sort of component. We're still -- we still don't own the business. Obviously, we don't have a lot of detailed information around where they are at. But my expectation would be that, that is not a significant issue for us in that business. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks for the extra color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Unidentified Participant : Hey. Good morning, everybody. This is [indiscernible] for Mike. Hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the order entry comment. It looks like orders were down sequentially. You talked about pressure in China in the Asia Pacific region. And then obviously, some of the -- some of the businesses are bouncing along the bottom. Can you maybe talk about some of the puts and takes that kind of got you to study? It just sounded like maybe the commentary was skewed a little bit more on to the negative side. And if you could just provide a little bit of color around order entry so far through August, if you said, that would be great. Sundaram Nagarajan : All right. Let me start with where we're at in terms of the businesses, which is our electronics business and our fluid components biopharma business, both of those order entry has bottomed out is the best way to put it. So where they are currently performing, they have come to a place where we feel good about that it is not any further declines. We've seen as the quarter progressed, we could start to see that this is at the bottom. In terms of our businesses that are performing incredibly well and contributed to the growth, medical interventional business and our polymer solution business on the other end of the spectrum have done well and the order entry remains pretty robust. And then you have a group of businesses sort of in the middle, some a little bit high, some a little bit low. In all of those cases, what we truly find is the order entry has sequentially improved. They have improved through the quarters, and that's kind of where we would say. The order entry has not significantly picked up or significantly declined. And that's really how we come to saying that it is about steady. Unidentified Participant : Got it. That's super helpful. And then following up on the question differentiating between T&I and the dispense side within the electronics business. Naga, you mentioned that the amplitude of the cycles is different between T&I. But can you maybe talk about the length? I know, for instance, we kind of refer to a typical four to five quarter slowdown in dispense. When the paper comes for the T&I business, is it typical to think of the length of the cycle and slowdown in similar terms, or should we be thinking about them differently as well? Sundaram Nagarajan : No. From what we know and based on our experience, no, it's about similar. Maybe -- is there an offset? There could be a slight offset, but nothing significant. We don't believe so. Unidentified Participant : Understood. All right. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Naga for closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Our strong operating performance reflects the strength of our differentiated precision technology, customer-centric model and diversified end-markets. Again, I want to thank Nordson employees for their commitment, which makes these results possible. The continued deployment of Ascend strategy will position us well for long-term growth. Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nordson Corporation Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, December 14, 2023, to report Nordson's fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; Joseph Kelly, Executive Vice President; and Stephen Shamrock, Interim Chief Financial Officer. While Joe recently took a new role as Executive Vice President, Industrial Precision Solutions segment, he was CFO for the entirety of fiscal 2023 and will represent that viewpoint in today's call. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until December 21, 2023. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss fourth quarter and full year highlights. He will then turn the call over to Joe to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. Joe also will talk about the year-end balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will conclude with high level commentary about our enterprise performance, including an update on the Ascend strategy, as well as our fiscal 2024 first quarter and full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to Slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and full year conference call. In 2021, Nordson launched its Ascend strategy to achieve top-tier growth with leading margins and returns. We set a goal to deliver $3 billion in sales and greater than 30% EBITDA margins by 2025. As we complete the third year of our strategy, we are on track toward achieving these objectives. This is a testament to our employees who have in the last three years developed and deployed the Ascend strategy and tackled dynamic macroeconomic conditions including a pandemic, global supply chain pressure, labor challenges, and rising interest rates to name a few. In 2023, we also managed the unique period of biopharma destocking as well as the cyclical electronics end markets. The core elements of our business model has enabled us to deliver profitable growth throughout these challenges. This includes a fundamental focus on our customers, commitment to innovation, diversified geographic and end market exposure, and a high level of recurring revenue through aftermarket parts and consumables. Since launching the Ascend strategy, we have added new capabilities to our model, including the NBS Next growth framework and a division-led structure which has empowered our teams to respond rapidly to changing market conditions. This led to solid financial performance in the quarter and the year, exceeding our targeted incremental and decremental profit targets in all three segments. Combining all of these factors with our capital deployment strategy to strengthen our precision technology portfolio, we delivered record sales, 31% EBITDA margin, and record cash flow in fiscal 2023. I'll speak more to this in a few moments, but I'll now turn the call over to Joe to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. Joseph Kelley : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 5, you'll see fourth quarter 2023 sales were $719 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter sales of $684 million. The increase included 7% growth from acquisitions of ARAG and CyberOptics and favorable currency translation of 1%, offset by an organic sales decrease of 3%. The organic sales decrease was primarily volume offset by price as we continue to pass through year-over-year cost inflation. In line with our expectations, the volume decline was concentrated in the electronics, dispense, and our biopharma businesses. This pressure was largely offset by double-digit growth in medical interventional solutions, industrial coatings, and polymer processing product lines compared to the prior year. Gross profit, excluding the non-recurring amortization of acquired inventory, totaled $389 million or 54% of sales, a 7% increase over the prior year fourth quarter of $363 million or 53% of sales. The gross profit dollar increase was driven by sales growth, and the gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was driven primarily by improvement in factory efficiency. SG&A in the fourth quarter increased to $199 million versus $186 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Excluding $6 million in non-recurring transaction fees related to the ARAG acquisition, SG&A increased 4% over the prior year, representing 27% of sales, consistent with the prior year. Adjusted operating profit, excluding $11 million in non-recurring acquisition costs and step-up inventory amortization was $196 million in the quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year. We generated very strong incremental operating profit margins of 51% on the 5% sales growth, which can be attributed to our team's continued dedication to executing the NBS Next growth framework and their related ability to rapidly respond to changing market conditions. EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 12% over the prior year to a record $227 million, or 32% of sales, which is 200 basis points above our long-term profitability target, as we articulated in our Ascend strategy. This compares to $202 million or 30% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. As we continue to execute the Ascend strategy and scale through acquisitions, EBITDA will be a key metric for profitability and cash flow generation. Looking at non-operating income and expense, I am happy to report that in September, we successfully accessed the public bond market with our inaugural issuance of investment grade rated debt. We raised $850 million in five and 10 year bonds to repay the short term borrowings used to finance the ARAG acquisition with the balance of the funds coming from our revolver. Interest expense in the quarter totaled $26 million, an increase of $21 million over the prior year quarter. $7 million of the increase is non-recurring financing costs associated with the repayment of the short-term borrowings. The remaining $14 million increase is a result of higher debt levels and increased interest rates. Other net income decreased $3 million due to significant currency fluctuations that generated a $4 million currency exchange gain in the prior year that did not repeat in the current year. Tax expense was $33 million for an effective tax rate of 20% in the quarter, slightly below the full year and within our guidance range. Net income totaled $128 million or $2.22 per share. Adjusted earnings per share excluding non-recurring acquisition related expenses totaled $2.46 per share, a 1% increase over the prior year. This improvement despite the increase in interest expense is reflective of consistent application of the NBS Next growth framework, which leads to steady, profitable growth with attractive incremental margins. Turning to Slide number 6, I'll now share a few comments on our full year results. Sales for the fiscal year 2023 were a record $2.6 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year's previous record sales results. This increase was driven 4% from the CyberOptics and ARAG acquisitions, offset by an organic decrease of 1% and an unfavorable currency impact of 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $707 million, or 27% of sales, which was comparable to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted operating profit grew year-over-year 1%. EBITDA for the full year increased 1% to a record $819 million, or 31% of sales. This marks the third consecutive year of the Ascend strategy delivering EBITDA growth. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $9.03, a 4% decrease from the prior year. The decrease in adjusted earnings is primarily a result of higher adjusted interest expense of $30 million associated with both the CyberOptics and the ARAG acquisitions and higher borrowing rates. Overall, the company's performance remains strong and in line or ahead of targets established as part of the Ascend strategy. Now, let's turn to Slide 7 through 9 to review the fourth quarter 2023 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $405 million increased 14% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Organic growth in the quarter was 4%, with the ARAG acquisition adding 7%, and a favorable currency impact of 2%. It is noteworthy that the 4% organic growth is over a very strong fourth quarter of 2022 and represents an all-time quarterly sales record for the segment, excluding ARAG. Robust demand in the polymer processing, industrial coatings, and packaging product lines combined with the execution of the Ascend strategy drove this quarter's results. Geographically, growth was strong in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. EBITDA for the quarter was $148 million, or 37% of sales, which is an increase of 26% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $118 million. This growth was driven primarily by leveraging organic sales growth at incremental margins well in excess of our target, plus the benefit of the ARAG acquisition. Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $169 million decreased 7% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in organic sales volume of 8%, offset by a modest 1% currency benefit. The volume declines were the result of continued softness in medical fluid components related to the biopharma end markets, as well as the fluid solutions product lines, offset by double-digit growth in our medical interventional solutions product lines. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $62 million or 37% of sales, which is a decrease of 4% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $64 million. EBITDA margins continue to be negatively impacted by the sales mix changes within the medical product lines, but improved factory efficiency within the fluid solutions division enabled profit margin expansion. Turning to Slide 9, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales of $145 million decreased 1% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This change included a decrease in organic sales volume of 16%, offset by the CyberOptics acquisition, which contributed 15%, the highest quarterly sales to date under Nordson ownership. The organic sales decline was primarily driven by continued softness in our electronics dispensed product lines that served the cyclical semiconductor end market and by way of reference, had a difficult comparison as the prior year fourth quarter had 28% organic growth. Based on customer conversations and historic trends, we continue to expect demand in the semiconductor market to anniversary in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and begin to recover in the back half of calendar \u201824. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $35 million or 24% of sales, a decrease of $5 million from the prior year fourth quarter. Noteworthy, however, for this segment is the increased profitability level in the down part of the cycle when you compare the 24% EBITDA margin to the 14% EBITDA margin in fiscal 2020. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 10. We had another very strong cash flow quarter, generating $153 million in free cash flow at a cash conversion rate of 120% on net income. For the full year 2023, Nordson generated a record free cash flow of $607 million at a cash conversion rate of 124%. With our record free cash flow, we were able to repay approximately $425 million of debt and return capital to our shareholders. Dividend payments were $39 million in the quarter, reflective of the 5% increase in the annual dividend. In addition, we purchased $10 million of shares at an average price of $216 per share. Through our strategic capital deployment, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet. Our cash balance was $116 million, and net debt was $1.6 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2 times based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA, well within our targeted range. For modeling purposes, in fiscal \u201824, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22%, capital expenditures of approximately $40 million to $50 million, and interest expense of approximately $75 million to $80 million. In summary, our segments effectively responded to dynamic conditions throughout fiscal 2023 by using the data-driven NBS Next growth framework. This led to segment financial performance exceeding our targeted incremental and decremental profit targets. We are also seeing nice contributions from our recent acquisitions, which is indicative of the strength of our capital deployment strategy and the differentiation we are adding to our precision technology portfolio. I want to congratulate the team on achieving record sales and EBITDA as well as the record cash flow performance this year. I'll now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Joe. During last year's conference call, as we set the stage for fiscal 2023, I noted that Nordson was well positioned to perform during periods of economic uncertainty. It certainly proved true for all the reasons I listed earlier in the call. Fundamental focus on our customers, commitment to innovation, diversified geographic and end market exposure, and a high level of recurring revenue. The Ascend strategy has added to these core strengths. Our NBS Next growth framework is becoming a competitive advantage as it is deployed holistically across the company. Put simply, NBS Next is a data-driven segmentation framework that drives choices, focus, and simplification. In fiscal year 2022, we had two divisions that achieved market-leading business performance. That number expanded in 2023 with all divisions making tremendous progress. They're using the framework to guide their focus on best growth opportunities and deliver on time, quality products, winning business, and growing market share. Our medical interventional solutions business successfully deployed this framework to achieve double-digit sales growth throughout 2023 by focusing on its best growth opportunities and simplifying elsewhere. Our electronics processing division leveraged this period of weaker end market demand to carefully curate its product portfolio based on the best growth opportunities. The team recognized through segmentation analysis that the extreme customization we offered created complexity and resulted in longer lead times. Applying NBS Next methodology with our deep voice of customer research, the team reduced complexity, improved lead times, and is gaining market share. The electronics division has used the downside of the cycle to implement NBS Next, achieving its target decremental margins in the second half of fiscal 2023. They're well positioned for the incremental earnings growth that will come when the semiconductor end market start to recover in the second half of calendar 2024. In 2023, we also made progress on the acquisition front of our Ascend strategy, which is a key priority of our strategic capital deployment. We closed the ARAG acquisition on August 24th, 2023. The integration is going well, and we are impressed by ARAG's precision agricultural technology and the energy, excellence our new employees bring to Nordson. Since the launch of the Ascend strategy, we have acquired approximately $400 million in revenue and are 80% of the way toward our acquisitive revenue target. We see ample opportunity in the pipeline to achieve this target, particularly in the medical and testing inspection platforms. That said, we will remain focused to acquire differentiated precision technologies that meets our strategic and financial criteria. To enable acquisitive growth, we went to the public markets this summer. As a first-time issuer, we achieved investment-grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P. Both ratings agencies cited Nordson's strong cash flow and healthy financial profile as key reasons for the strong ratings debut. We appreciate the flexibility that public debt will afford us as we continue executing on the acquisition and capital deployment portion of our strategy. In summary, I am very pleased with the progress of our Ascend strategy and believe we are well positioned entering fiscal 2024. I am also pleased that we have made this progress while sustaining our culture and values. For example, in fiscal 2023, our employees, company, and the Nordson Corporation Foundation donated over $13 million into the communities that our employees live and work to support education, human welfare services, and other charitable activities. Turning now to the outlook on Slide 12. We enter fiscal 2024 with approximately $800 million in backlog. The sequential backlog reduction is reflective of strong system sales in the fourth quarter as well as a paced return to normalized levels. Based on the combination of order entry, backlog, customer delivery timing requests, and current foreign exchange rates, we anticipate delivering sales growth in the range of 4% to 9% above fiscal 2023 sales. Full year fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to be in the range of 1% to 8% growth per diluted share. Please note that we are updating our definition of adjusted earnings starting in fiscal 2024 to exclude acquisition-related amortization. As acquisitions will continue to be a critical part of our strategy, we believe this is prudent and more reflective of how we and investors think about our business in terms of earnings and cash flow growth performance. This full year guidance assumes a neutral impact from foreign exchange rates, a recovery of semiconductor end markets in the second half of calendar 2024, and the ARAG acquisition contributing approximately 5% growth at the midpoint of our guidance. As you will see on Slide 13, first quarter fiscal 2024 sales are forecasted in the range of $615 million to $640 million and adjusted earnings in the range of $2.00 to $2.10 per diluted share. Before we open it for questions, I want to take a moment to thank Joe for his leadership as CFO over the past three plus years. Joe, I've appreciated your partnership and we are all excited to see you develop your career as the new leader of our IPS segment. As we move forward into fiscal 2024, Steve Shamrock will take over as Interim CFO while we conduct our search for a successor. Joe's move and Steve's seamlessly stepping in during the transition are examples of Nordson focusing on developing winning teams, an important success factor in building a scalable, high quality growth engine. Again, I want to thank our employees, customers, and shareholders for your continued support. We will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Allison Poliniak : Hi, good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Allison. Allison Poliniak : Naga, you touched on the EBITDA margin that you posted in 2023, certainly strong and well ahead of your target. How do we think of that EBITDA margin from here? How does it evolve over the next, say, two to three years? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Allison, as we launched the Ascend strategy, our target was to have 50% of our growth come from organic and 50% from acquisitions. And we also set the stage for our organic growth obviously comes at a higher incremental margins when compared to our acquisitions. So as we move forward, we fundamentally believe this 31% is a sustainable level at which we are operating. Depending on the mix of organic and acquisition, this is a sustainable level that we are able to maintain. Allison Poliniak : Got it. And then could you touch on the biopharma market, just sort of the cadence of recovery, just how you're thinking about that specific market in \u201824, just given the challenges it had in \u2018\u201923 around the inventory size? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. We start to -- by the end of the first quarter, we start to anniversary the decline in biopharma due to destocking. Longer term, we fundamentally believe that this is a great marketplace for Nordson and will return to the high single digit number. In the interim though, we are taking a conservative and definitely a realistic view of saying the recovery is going to be slower. Allison Poliniak : Okay, but I guess that I think you just touched on it though, so there's no real structural impediment for that market in your view to not reach that sort of high single-digit growth rate that it historically achieved? Sundaram Nagarajan : Absolutely not. Right? If you think about this, one of the key areas of focus for us is the use of single-use plastics, which essentially go to replace the stainless steel nectars and stainless steel full lines. And that transition is still in its early stages. So we fundamentally believe that there is nothing here that is impaired. It's a matter of timing and it's certainly a matter of recovery certainly you know so long-term no issues We expect we'll probably get to high single-digits. Allison Poliniak : Perfect. Thank you and congrats, Joe, on the move. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Joseph Kelley : Thank you, Allison. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead. Mike Halloran : Hey, morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Mike. Joseph Kelley : Good morning, Mike. Mike Halloran : Just want to help me understand a couple of questions on guidance here. First, what's the organic assumption embedded in the growth rate? And I know you gave the FX side already but maybe just some help on what you're assuming for organic growth? Sundaram Nagarajan : Steve, you got it? Stephen Shamrock : Yeah, this is Steve. So for the full year guidance, as Naga pointed out, we're forecasting growth of 6%. And ARAG is at 5%. So that would imply organic growth of about 1% because we would say based on current rates, we're FX neutral. So that's how we're thinking about the overall growth rate of 6%. Mike Halloran : Thanks for that. And then on the electronics assumptions, you mentioned back half recovery. What informs that? It certainly sounds like part of it is comparisons, part of it is historical recovery curves. Is there anything customers are saying or build rate forecasts or anything else that you would point to? Sundaram Nagarajan : What I would tell you is the two things that you already acknowledged, which is really historical trends. Certainly, we have a direct sales model and our teams are spending a lot of time with our customers understanding what their requirements are and when they would show up. If you were to point to anything, you would say the pipeline of opportunities continue to be -- to point towards that timeline of recovery. Mike Halloran : And then last one, just on the IPS side. Are you assuming relatively normal sequential patterns from here? Any thoughts on how you're looking at the end market cadencing, demand levels, things like that? I mean, packaging was strong this quarter, which felt a little surprising. So any context on that would also be helpful. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, sure, Mike. IPS has been running at or above our long-term growth rates here now for two, three years now. And what our expectation is that we don't see anything in the order entry that gives us a pause. Good backlog and good order entry that we expect to sustain growth in the coming years. A significant contribution on IPS growth for the coming year would be through the ARAG acquisition. Mike Halloran : Got it. Really appreciate it. Thank you for your time. Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Morning, Jeff. Joseph Kelley : Morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So maybe go back to the organic. It looks like the range is kind of minus 4% to plus 1%. Do you see all the segments at the midpoint growing or are there some segments that clearly have growth and others that are maybe down? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. We just talked about IPS. IPS today at or above our long-term growth rates continue to sustain modest growth in the year coming up. ATS is going to be flattish in that, what I would tell you is that first half we're going to be continuing down, second half continue to improve. And so that will be flattish to slight growth. MFS though, we have medical interventional components continuing to be pretty strong growth for us. Our bio-pharma business, anniversarying itself and not being a drag, and then improvement in our fluid solutions towards the back half of the year. Overall, our expectation is that MFS returns to a pretty nice growth next year -- modest growth for that segment. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. Thanks for that color, Naga. Just, ARAG, there's been a lot of commentary about ARAG slowing. I'm just wondering if ARAG is seeing that pressure, it seems like the math maybe suggests a little bit lower revenue contribution than maybe when you first bought it, just speak to what you're seeing there real time. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, let me start it and then Joe in his new role can certainly give you some color on ARAG as well. What we see -- remember 45% of our ARAG\u2019s revenues are recurring revenue. And they're typically products or short life replacement cycles. So mostly nozzles and things like that. So we will benefit from that and that is not going to see the pressure you're going to see. The other thing what I would tell you is that ARAG\u2019s components, much like Nordson, is critical low-cost component for the customers and also components that drive efficiency, reduce waste. And so typically what our expectation is that the -- that we're going to see limited impact from that. And so let me maybe have Joe talk about where we finished the year for ARAG in Nordson fiscal year and then talk a little bit about our expectation for next year. Joseph Kelley : Yeah. So, Jeff, if you think about ARAG, they finished the Nordson, what I'll call, calendar fiscal 2023, delivering $155 million in sales. And the midpoint of our guidance suggests that ARAG\u2019s sales grow in 2024. And so, despite some of the news that you're hearing in the ag space, when you look at the components that they provide, the 45% that's run rate parts and consumables that Naga mentioned, we have it moderated the growth rate from what was previously articulated, but it is still growing when you look at it year-over-year. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then just a housekeeping. Amortization in \u201824, is it $20 million a quarter, $80 million? Is that kind of the right run rate or how should we think about that? Stephen Shamrock : Yeah, Jeff, I would tell you the guidance on amortization is in the range of $74 million to $78 million for the full year and about $19 million in Q1. Jeff Hammond : Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Please go ahead. Matt Summerville : Thanks. I was hoping maybe you gave a little bit more granular detail on expectations for MFS. I was hoping you could kind of talk through the same thing for IPS, how you're thinking about rigid, flexible packaging, non-wovens, product assembly, coatings, as we move into \u201824. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, hey, let's -- generally we don't give guidance around the segment, but I will certainly give you some what we are seeing in the marketplace and hopefully that will answer the question, Matt. So let's start with packaging, right? Packaging is doing fairly well. It is -- the order entry rates and things like that suggest that the backlogs have returned to normal. The parts part of the business is doing fairly well. And so we expect packaging to continue to be steady as we have experienced thus far. So that is packaging. As you think about system businesses like coatings or polymers, as we enter the year, we enter the year with some pretty strong backlog. And so we fundamentally believe that that is one that will help us in the growth there. Non-wovens has been a business that continues to -- has not declined any further. Will continue to be tracking in the same place where we are. We certainly have a number of product applications. This is sort of applications such as battery, think about applications in e-commerce, fabric bonding and many other miscellaneous application. This is the part of the business where it is application by application and this one is doing well as well. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more color and hopefully answers the question you're asking, Matt? Matt Summerville : Yeah, I appreciate the detail there. Maybe just over to ATS, two quick things. Are you actually seeing an inflection in CyberOptics business pointing out the fact that you had the strongest quarter for that business since the acquisition? And then if you can comment a little further on how you're thinking about test and inspection for \u201924. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, as you think about test and inspection, we've had strong, strong years here now going. Even last year when our dispense business was down a bit, you also found them to be doing fairly well. But as you go into next year, we expect that we would have challenging comms for our x-ray business. We certainly expect that our optical business and our acoustic business, which we've not talked about in the past, is an area that we feel there is some strength. And too early to say we have reached an inflection point, but certainly telling you that this is an area that we are well positioned to take advantage of any market movement. Customer conversation, pipeline activity, all still indicating second half of the year, calendar year, that we have a good recovery. But I think we feel good about where we are, particularly on CyberOptics, we've had now a year of experience with this. CyberOptics is exactly what we thought it was, incredibly fantastic technology that has added to the portfolio. So our thesis around expanding our precision technology portfolio with CyberOptics is certainly strong. And our expectations are that we continue to be able to solve more problems for our customers and continue to benefit on this investment in semiconductors that is expected to come. Matt Summerville : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. I was just curious about the ATS foreground, spend another moment on that. You said your team is very engaged talking to customers, so that sounds like everyone is on the same page in terms of expecting a recovery. Are you just seeing like materialization of pre-RFP activity? Is there, like, improving breadth month to month? Just curious how the cadence is there. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, I would go back to what we were talking about, which is really great customer conversations, historical trends all pointing towards second half of calendar 2024. Clearly our pipeline activity continues to be pretty good. And our expectation is that, that translates into order entry and translates into shipment. Beyond that, I -- our expectation for the ATS is it's going to be flat, but first half down, second half up. And if you look historically, that has been a fairly good indicator and we believe that. So our guidance is based on APS being flat, not significant growth. Christopher Glynn : Yep, yep, I understand the timing. Thanks for that. And then a quick one on MFS, the kind of non-medical fluid solutions portion. I think you talked about some significant manufacturing and productivity benefits there from cost actions and NBS Next. Curious how that industrial fluid solutions business, I think it's short cycle oriented. How's that -- a little more detail on how that's behaving, please? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, that is going fairly well. I would say early times here. We are very pleased with the improvements that teams have made in manufacturing and the business starting to return to where it typically operates. A significant pickup in this business is going to be tied to the electronic customers in Asia as well, right? And so this is a business that has some electronic exposure and that they will benefit from that as the second half picks up for them. But overall on the industrial side it seems to be steady. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Thanks, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Walt Liptak with Seaport Research. Please go ahead. Walt Liptak : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wonder\u2026 Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Walt. Walt Liptak : Good morning. You guys haven't talked too much about pricing yet and there's still some inflation out there even though it's come down. How are you thinking about systems pricing and component pricing as you start going into the new year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Steve, this is something that you want to touch on? Stephen Shamrock : Yeah, to answer that question, what I would say is, again, just to remind you and everyone that really when we talk about pricing, I mean, we're selling the value of our products to our customers. So we've not passed through large inflationary price increases as a result of that. I mean, again, our focus is maintaining our very strong gross margins from that perspective. So, as I mentioned earlier with the organic growth guidance, the 1% for FY \u201824, I would think that that organic growth would be balanced in terms of a little bit coming from volume and price, but again, it's not something that we're really focused on from that perspective. Again, our focus is on maintaining those gross margins. Walt Liptak : Okay, great. And I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the ag markets and just the -- regionally, ARAG is pretty international in Europe and South America. I wonder if you could talk a little bit, give us some insight on how those markets are trending and we probably have a better view on the US, but -- so maybe the second part of the question is, you guys are looking at kind of a new opportunity in the US for market share. Can you grow the US part of the business next year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, let me start and then Joe can add a little bit more color to the business. As you think about ARAG, right, what we acquired is a European market leader, great technology, strong position in Europe, strong position in South America in an end market that is growing, right? So our models and our expectations are that we deliver on that promise around continuing to grow the European business and continue to grow the South American business. We certainly recognize that we have an opportunity in North America. But we also understand the market dynamics in North America. Any wins and any expansion here will be at least additional icing on the cake, if you so will, to our model. And so, we like the technology, we like the market position, and the market structure in Europe is uniquely different from North America, and maybe let Joe add color to the work that they're doing in Europe and in our technology. So, Joe? Joseph Kelley : Yeah, Walt. You think about just the level set on ARAG, their precision dispensing fluid components that are predominantly components sold to implement manufacturers, spray manufacturers. And when you look, it's again, predominantly a European business, a very broad footprint throughout Europe through their distribution model and selling to implement manufacturers. And so that market again is, I would tell you, the main driver of our forecast when you think about the ARAG business and the growth that we're forecasting for 2024. The US and other geographies outside of Europe and South America where ARAG has a strong footprint represents opportunity. And when you think about Nordson and our broad geographic footprint, our ability to, I would say, realize some of those opportunities, I think is enhanced as opposed to a standalone ARAG business. And so when you think about that, we're starting to see in the integration, some of these opportunities start to fill in in the pipeline. And so again, we're optimistic that long term, we can make this a global division within Nordson with a broad geographic footprint. Walt Liptak : Okay. All right. Yeah, thanks for that answer. And, if I could just try one more on the IPS segment for Joe. I wonder if you could just help us characterize how you're looking at kind of the general industrial system spending for next year, what the funnel looks like, and maybe some of the bigger subsegments like around automotive or consumer good? Joseph Kelley : Yes. So, just to level set, the IPS segment is coming off now, I would say, two very strong years. If you look back at \u201822, they delivered a 7% organic growth. In \u201823, it grew 3% organically. So as we head into \u201824, we're looking to really maintain that from the level where we are. What drove it, if you go back to \u201822, was a lot of the large systems in the liquid coatings. And then in \u201823, it turned, there was heavy automotive, actually growth in automotive on the coating side. And then on the plastic processing side and the recycling. That was strong in the back half of \u201822 and continued to be strong in \u201823. And so those large systems businesses within IPS, they do carry a nice backlog into 2024. That being said, the remaining portion of the IPS business backlog there has moderated. So, when you see the backlog come down to $800 million, I would tell you that's the elevated backlog moderating back to historical terms for the remainder of that business. That being said, the order entry there remains steady and is supportive of our forecast. So, you're familiar with the business, particularly on the packaging side. When systems come down due to investment, parts typically help offset that in terms of growth of parts. And so it's really a nice mix. And I would tell you, we've benefited from automotive liquid coatings and then the polymer processing last couple years on the system side. But the remaining broad-based [industry] (ph) remains steady. Walt Liptak : Okay, great. Okay, thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Right, I mean one thing that I would add Walt is really, in general the company is a recession resilient company and a portfolio that helps us get through uncertain economic environments or downturns in specific end markets, right? That's what you saw happen in \u201823. As we think about \u201824, really what were our expectation is [IPSA] (ph) study, ATS is flattish to slight growth, and MFS returns to pretty modest growth. And that's kind of how I would think about it. And a pretty strong EBITDA margin in last year, and we'll continue to expect to see the same next year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Joseph Kelley : Good morning. Andrew Buscaglia : Just one last clarification on your guidance. So the low end, if you look at the organic sales growth, the low end of that guidance, if you model that out, it doesn't really assume much of a recovery at all. Is that correct? And then how much of the recovery is really easy comps versus demand actually picking up? Stephen Shamrock : Yeah. So what I would tell you, Andrew, is from a general guidance perspective, I mean, at the low end of our sales guidance, we're talking about 4% basically from that perspective. So obviously, there -- what would get us towards the lower end there is obviously, if there is the recovery on the ATS side, for example, is slower than what we would expect if FX rates go against us, those types of things. And I think we talked earlier, I think Naga mentioned it as well, just from a comp standpoint, with some of the businesses that we were talking about, right, whether it was fluid solutions or on the electronic side within ATS. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. And then what about the easy comps versus demand picking up? Is that -- to get to the midpoint, do we need demand to come back? Sundaram Nagarajan : Sorry, go ahead, Steve. Stephen Shamrock : No, what I was going to say is, I mean, just from a midpoint perspective, again, I mean, that assumes 1% organic growth overall. So, again, there would be some volume embedded in there. So we would expect it to pick up, right? I mean, just kind of given the, by segment, like we talked earlier, from that perspective, ATS, again, we'd expect some second half pick up there in the end of Q2 or Q3 and Q4. We talked about the fluid components earlier and even fluid solutions. I know Naga referenced that as well, electronic assembly picking up in the back half of the year as well. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Sundaram Nagarajan : Andrew, I would just add, if I could, the way I think about it is full year, our guidance says we're going to grow 6% at the midpoint, roughly speaking and Q1 is growth of 3%. So basically, it implies that the growth rate picks up past Q1. And part of that, as you mentioned, is the comps get easier in Q2 and Q3, particularly because that's when the ATS and the biopharma pullback really occurred. And so the growth rate is, let's just say, 3% in Q1 and then picks up to 7% in the remaining three quarters, with it being the heaviest in Q2 and Q3 because the comps are easier. Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah, okay. And in ATS, margins kind of move around quite a bit historically, so it's hard to gauge a pattern. But is the main driver here for ATS long-term volumes just picking back up, or are there cost-saving potential in that segment to get those up closer to a corporate average margin? Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me just maybe give you a broad view of how we're thinking about ATS, and then maybe Joe or Steve, you guys could add more color to it. What I would say is, ATS at 24% EBITDA, and you compare them to their competitors in the markets that they play in is pretty strong. And one of the reasons is that, look, the R&D load here is much higher than some of our other businesses. So, expectation shouldn't be that ATS gets to the total company average numbers. It'll -- you're always going to find that you have 14% SG&A cost here in the -- in our business in ATS when compared to IPS, which is a much smaller number. So that\u2019s -- the only level setting I want to do is make sure that you\u2019re not -- your expectations for ATS should be in line with ATS, not in line with the total company average. Joseph Kelley : And the comment, down the full year, we're quite pleased with what we've done to improve the profitability of that business. And here we are at the low point in the cycle and we're delivering this [24%, 23%] (ph) EBITDA margins and so we're well positioned to participate in the recovery but that doesn't mean you should expect it to get to Nordson's the other segments levels of profitability. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, thank you guys. Stephen Shamrock : The only, I was going to say, maybe the only other point I would add there too is we've done a nice job in that segment as well, Andrew, just in terms of our decremental margins being very favorable to our targets, right? So we're really managing the costs appropriately based on volume, so. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay, thank you. Operator : And at this time, there appear to be no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Naga for any closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. We're making great progress on the Ascend strategy. We're well positioned for profitable growth in fiscal 2024. We remain focused on achieving our long-term objective of delivering top-tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. I wish all of you a happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude the Nordson Corporation fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 conference call. We thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nordson First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to Lara Mahoney. Lara, you may begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO, and Stephen Shamrock, Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer.  We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, February 22 to report Nordson's Fiscal 2024 first quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com\\investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 30 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Thursday, February 29, 2024. During this conference call, we will make references to non-GAAP financial metrics. We've provided a reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric in the press release issued yesterday.  Before we begin, please refer to slide 2 of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to materially differ.  Moving to today's agenda on slide 3, Naga will discuss first quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Steve to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. He will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will then share a high level commentary about our enterprise performance. He will conclude with an update on the fiscal 2024 full year and second quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to slide 4 and hand the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. At the outset, I'd like to recognize the dedicated Nordson team who leverage the NBS Next growth framework to deliver solid first quarter results.  Sales of $633 million were near the top of our first quarter guidance range. This was driven by strong performance in our medical interventional, industrial coatings and polymer processing product lines, which more than offset continued weakness in our electronics product lines.  In addition, our focus on top customers and differentiated products improved product mix. This focus, in addition to simplifying and strategically adjusting costs, led to strong incremental margins, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $2.21. This exceeded our EPS guidance for the quarter.  Finally, I'd like to highlight our first quarter free cash flow of $165 million, which was 150% of net income. This was a new first quarter record.  I would also like to recognize the steady progress of our ARAG integration, which contributed to our sales and EBITDA margin performance in the quarter. We continue to be excited about the technology and precision agriculture end market as well as the engagement and energy of our new employees.  I'll speak more about the enterprise performance in few minutes, but, first, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Stephen Shamrock : Thank you, Naga. And good morning to everyone. On slide number 5, you'll see first quarter fiscal 2024 sales were $633 million, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year's first quarter sales of $610 million. This was driven by a favorable 5% benefit from the ARAG acquisition, partially offset by an organic decrease of 2%.  Consistent with prior quarters, the organic sales decrease was primarily volume, partially offset by price as we continue to pass through year-over-year cost inflation. As Naga referenced, strength in our industrial and medical product lines were offset by ongoing weakness in our electronics product lines. Gross profit excluding non-recurring inventory step up amortization in both periods totaled $351 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $333 million in the prior year first quarter. This improvement in adjusted gross margin of approximately 100 basis points reflect the combination of factors. With our NBS Next growth framework, we are focusing on top products driving a favorable product mix. During the quarter, we also had higher parts sales and improved factory efficiencies, which helped drive the year-over-year improvements.  As we execute the Ascend strategy and build scale through strategic acquisitions, EBITDA is increasingly important as a key profitability metric. EBITDA, adjusted for acquisition related items in both periods, totaled $197 million or 31% of sales, a 9% increase over the prior year EBITDA of $181 million, driven by improved gross margins and cost controls as well as contribution from the ARAG acquisition.  Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense increased $10 million associated with higher debt levels and increased interest rates. Other net expenses decreased $3 million, primarily related to lower foreign exchange losses compared to the prior year.  Tax expense was $29 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is in line with the prior year rate and our guidance range for 2024.  Net income in the quarter totaled $110 million or $1.90 per share. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-recurring acquisition costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $23 million, totaled $2.21 per share, a 3% increase from the prior year adjusted earnings per share amount of $2.14. This improvement continues to demonstrate the benefits of our successful execution of the Ascend strategy.  Now let's turn to slide 6 through 8 to review the first quarter 2024 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $355 million increased 14% compared to the prior year first quarter, driven by the ARAG acquisition, as well as increased sales in our industrial coatings, polymer processing and non-wovens businesses. Organic sales increased 2% over the prior year first quarter, continuing to build upon a record fiscal 2023 for this segment. EBITDA, excluding ARAG acquisition related costs, was $126 million in the first quarter or 36% of sales, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $109 million. The increase in EBITDA was driven primarily by the ARAG acquisition, plus the organic sales growth of the base business.  It's worth highlighting that this quarter marks 12 out of 13 consecutive quarters of EBITDA growth and 11 of 13 quarters of organic year-over-year sales growth.  On slide 7, you'll see Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $160 million increase 3% compared to the prior year's first quarter, driven by another quarter of double-digit growth in our medical interventional solutions product line, offsetting softness in our medical fluid components and fluid solutions product line.  During the quarter, we started to anniversary the weakness of last year's biopharma destocking, which was a significant headwind for this segment in fiscal 2023. First quarter EBITDA was $60 million or 37% of sales, which is an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year EBITDA of $53 million or 34% of sales. The 300 basis point improvement in EBITDA margin over the first quarter of 2023 is due primarily to a combination of factory efficiency gains and cost actions, coupled with leveraging the organic growth in medical interventional solutions.  Turning to slide 8, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales were $119 million, an 18% decrease compared to the prior year first quarter. The decrease in sales was driven by weakness across the segment, primarily electronics dispense products serving semiconductor end markets.  First quarter EBITDA was $22 million or 19% of sales, which trailed the prior year first quarter EBITDA of $31 million, excluding acquisition related costs. While the reduction in EBITDA was tied to the overall decrease in volume, favorable mix and cost reduction actions contributed to 32% decremental margins on adjusted operating profits. This is ahead of our decremental target of approximately 55%.  Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 9. At the end of the first quarter, we had cash of $136 million and net debt was $1.5 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.8 times based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities. I also want to highlight our strong cash flow performance. Free cash flow was $165 million, a first quarter record and $51 million improvement from the prior year. As a percentage of that income, free cash flow was 150% in the quarter.  We strategically deployed the strong cash flow in the quarter. We repaid $107 million of debt, paid $39 million in dividends, and spent $3 million on share repurchases under our 10b5-1 plan, buying back approximately 15,000 shares of company stock at an average price of $212 per share. For modeling purposes for the full fiscal year, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22%, capital expenditures of approximately $40 million to $50 million, and net interest expense of $74 million to $78 million.  I want to thank the Nordson team for all of their efforts in delivering another strong quarter.  We will now turn to slide 10 and I'll turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thanks, Steve. The Nordson team is getting off to a good start to the fiscal 2024. As I travel to our sites, I had the privilege of witnessing the impact of Ascend strategy in building a stronger Nordson that is delivering robust operating performance.  Nordson is sustaining market leading positions in diversified end markets through our close to the customer business model and differentiated precision technology. Now, NBS Next has become a new core strength and is manifested in how we operate our businesses.  Using data, our teams have a crystal clear view of the profitable growth opportunities in each division. Coupled with an entrepreneurial owner mindset, they are making choices on where they should prioritize growth, as well as where they must simplify. For example, the industrial coatings team worked with a significant automotive customer on a new electric battery application. They worked closely with the customer and were able to meet its needs with a standard product. Our efforts to standardize top product configurations and eliminate complex customization drove agile execution, shortening lead times and allowing them to be more responsive to the dynamic changes in customer needs.  Our medical interventional solutions team has identified its top products and implemented a visual demand based manufacturing or Kanban-based manufacturing system for their products. This has led to significant improvement in their on-time delivery performance over the last six months. The team had a big win when one of our medical device customers placed a large order and the team was able to respond quickly, serving dynamic changes in demand and delighting this top customer.  As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, the decisions our teams are making to focus on top products serves our customers well, enhances our product mix and improves our gross margins. In addition, their work on simplification resulted in strategic cost actions that contributed to our profitability in this quarter.  It is exciting to see NBS Next becoming a competitive advantage for Nordson and how the steady deployment across Nordson is positively impacting our financial results.  Our end markets are performing as expected at the start of our fiscal year. Industrial and consumer non-durable end markets are steady. The ARAG integration is going well and the team contributed to our sales and EBITDA margin performance in the quarter.  Our medical interventional solutions product lines continue to grow double-digits, buoyed by trends in non-invasive surgeries and the aging population. We have now anniversaried the negative impact of biopharma destocking that was a headwind in fiscal 2023.  We're seeing modest pickup in order entry within the fluid components product lines, which we are monitoring closely. Our guidance does not expect any significant pickup in biopharma growth short term. Our product lines exposed to the semiconductor electronics cycle experienced a weaker demand, as expected in the first quarter.  We remain very positive about the growth opportunities driving the next electronics cycle, including AI, automotive electronics, onshoring, CHIPS Act, and more. While we fully expected to see benefits of those opportunities in the second half of calendar 2024, we now realize it may be closer to the end of the year.  As the year progresses, we plan to provide investors with better visibility to what we have seen in the market. Through all of this, our ATS leaders have done a very good job of implementing the NBS Next growth framework and positioning themselves for future growth.  This includes positioning operations closer to the customer, focusing on differentiated product innovation, and making strategic cost adjustments. ATS ability to outperform their decremental targets in the quarter is a testament to this work.  Turning now to our outlook on slide 11. We enter the second quarter with approximately $750 million in backlog. This backlog remains concentrated in our systems businesses while customer order entry patterns have returned to historical norms in the rest of the businesses.  Based on current visibility and order entry trends, we are narrowing our previously issued full year revenue growth to 4% to 7% over record fiscal 2023. Full-year fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to be in the range of 2% to 7% growth per diluted share. This full year guidance continues to assume a neutral impact from FX rates and the ARAG acquisition contributing approximately 5% growth at the midpoint of guidance.  While we have raised the low end of our guidance, the lower midpoint of the range now assumes recovery of the semiconductor electronics end markets begins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, sales are forecasted to be in the range of $645 million to $670 million, with adjusted earnings in the range of $2.20 to $2.35 per diluted share. Second quarter guidance considers weaker electronics end markets and the impact of the Chinese New Year shutdown.  Before we open our call for questions, I wanted to recognize two new additions to our board of directors. In January, we welcome Chris Mapes, Executive Chairman and recently retired president and CEO of Lincoln Electric Holdings, as well as director at A.O. Smith and the Timken Company. Chris brings a wealth of global operations, M&A, and industrial experience to our board. Throughout his career, Chris has demonstrated track record of operating performance improvement and shareholder value creation.  Earlier this week, we announced the appointment of Annette Clayton to our board effective April 1. Annette is the Chairwoman and former president and CEO of Schneider Electric North America. Her career grew from production floor experience at General Motors to global operations and supply chain leadership at Dell Technologies to her leadership at Schneider, which focused on digital automation and energy management. In addition to her global operations and technology industry experience, Annette direct familiarity with Nordson's differentiated products and value proposition.  Both Chris and Annette will bring unique insight and value to our board of directors. We look forward to benefiting from their counsel as Nordson continues to grow and scale through the Ascend strategy.  As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support.  With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Matt Summerville : First, on the ATS business, what sort of transpired since the last call that has kind of prompted you to push out, Naga, if you will, third quarter, so the inflection that you've been talking about in electronics and semiconductor? And similarly, what gives you confidence that we're going to see something materialize this year? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : A couple of things. What we will tell you is the demand or shipments for ATS in the quarter was as expected, weaker as we had expected. But the order entry has not picked up, as we had hoped. The inflection in order entry is sort of the precursor to having shipments in the following quarters. So that is really what has happened in our thinking, is that this cycle inflects maybe a quarter later than what we had hoped.  But a couple of other things I will add to this that is really important to keep in mind. First and foremost, in the back half of the year, clearly comps get much easier for the business. Second thing I would also note, we have backlog, which have expected customer shipments, customer designated shipments in the second half. And then the third thing I would note for you is that we are beginning to see in a very small way in some niche businesses where we supply UV lamps to some front end semiconductor manufacturing customers. Order entry is very nicely up when compared to last year. It is a small part of the business, but it's a good early indicator.  In a same way, if you think about our electronic adhesives packaging businesses where we sell the barrels, we also see some pickup in business there, order entry and shipment. So a couple of early indicators.  And finally, what I will tell you is that our opportunity pipeline for projects with conversations with customers still remain robust. Nothing really has been shelved or put away.  So order entry has not turned yet. That is probably the takeaway you can have. But we have enough evidence in the business to feel strongly about how second half plays out for this business. So maybe I'll stop there. Matt Summerville : Just as a follow-up, and sticking with ATS, it sounded like in your prepared remarks that you saw maybe fairly broad weakness across the segment. Maybe you're implying that the test and inspection investment cycle you've been seeing last 18 months or so is starting to roll over? Is that the proper conclusion to be drawing here? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : In terms of the test and inspection, we have had some very robust growth in the last \u2013 the cycle and, past, our dispense business. So, what you're really seeing is some strong comparisons that are difficult to keep up with. What I would tell you and what has been our experience is that the test and inspection business cyclicality is much more muted when compared to our dispense business. That is a distinct difference. But, yes, it does go through a cycle and comps are also in its way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo, please go ahead. Hi, good Allison Poliniak-Cusic: In terms of growth here, there's obviously some headwinds still in that segment. Could you maybe talk to any structural challenges, if there are any, with that business in terms of maybe even competitive dynamics that would limit it to that kind of returning to that high single digit growth? Or nothing in the way, it's just sort of cyclical and you'd expect to achieve that at some point going forward? Just any thoughts there? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : MFS has returned to growth. And to your question about do we see any structural changes in our own position or the landscape? The answer is no. If you look at our medical interventional business, it is growing double digits, continues to grow double digits. And we expect this business to continue to grow high single-digits.  What you have in MFS is this medical fluid components which had the biopharma exposure, last year was a significant decline, right? And so, that significant decline essentially put MFS in a negative growth last year. But that is anniversaried.  And so, what we are beginning to see is a modest pickup in order entry in this business, not from biopharma, but from other end markets this business serves. We serve patient care, we serve surgical applications, and we see pretty good order entry there. And so, that is what you're seeing in terms of \u2013 over time, what you're going to find is, have MFS return to high single-digits.  And you have the fluid solutions business in there as well, which has a broad diversified exposure beyond medical. And so, that business is also tied a little bit to electronics and we're beginning to see some pick-up there. Allison Poliniak-Cusic: And then IPS, I think you talked about weather patterns starting to normalize there. Anything that, I would say, is sort of a red flag or does it seem pretty consistent in terms of what you're seeing in terms of demand for products in that business as well? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : IPS, steady. Order entry has steadied pretty good. But, look, we've been growing in this business for 11 out of 13 quarters. I mean, pretty remarkable growth. So, order entry is normalized. What we mean is that order entry patterns are similar to pre-COVID. That's what we mean by that.  What we also see is that you have strong backlog in big system business like our industrial coatings product line and our polymer process product line. That will essentially help us get through this year. And then it is good to remember ARAG is in this segment and is going to contribute 5% to our organic growth this year. So we feel really good about IPS.  So the way to think about it \u2013 if I were to summarize the two questions, one from Matt and from you, I will tell you, IPS steady, RI contributing 5% to the growth, MFS return to growth, pretty nice growth. And then ATS, we are expecting that we will start to recover in the fourth quarter of this year. So if you put all of that together, that is sort of what we have in terms of at the midpoint about 5% revenue growth in the top line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Saree Boroditsky : I believe book-to-bill was below 1 again this quarter. So when would you expect this to turn positive? And how do you think about backlog levels as you exit this year? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : If you look at our backlog, as we have noted in our release as well as in our conversations, $750 million, it is higher than where we normally would run for this size of a business. A historic normalized level will be about $600 million to $650 million, something like that. Order entry in most of the businesses have returned to normal order patterns. What we mean by that is we don't have any anxiety in the customer order patterns, right? So, if you go back even four quarters ago, you still had people \u2013 might be still concerned about supply chain constraints, and that doesn't exist anymore.  So I would say vast majority of our businesses, order entry has gotten to its historical levels, and the organic growth are based on those order entry rates. Stephen Shamrock : And maybe another data point I'd add to there as well, just to Naga's comments, if you think about the backlog, we consumed about $200 million last year for the full year as we transitioned more to a normalized environment. And in Q1, we consumed about $50 million. So, we're still on that, I'll say, normalized pace. Saree Boroditsky : So, you know the impact of the Chinese New Year in the second quarter, I believe in the past you've talked about it being a $15 million to $20 million impact. So would that still be the right way to think about the shift for this year? Stephen Shamrock : What I would tell you, as I think about the second quarter and the guidance we gave, and the timing of the Chinese New Year, I'd say, is roughly about a $10 million to $15 million impact. That's what we're seeing.  And if you really think about that, right, the guidance that we gave for the second quarter here at the midpoint, we've got sales growth of 1%, which would imply negative organic growth of 4%. Again, we're still expecting ARAG to contribute 5% and FX to be neutral.  If you think about that, that's about \u2013 half of that negative organic growth is coming from the Chinese New Year. Obviously, we had the opposite effect in Q1 as well, right? So even on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the organic growth rates in Q2 is not as bad on the surface as they look based on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Michael Halloran : Just want to follow up on that last comment there. Maybe you could talk about the seasonality as you think of the year here, right? I think this was the first year that I can see in my numbers that wasn't up sequentially, at least double digits, if not handsomely in the double-digit level. So I get the Chinese New Year impact. I get that you're shifting the semiconductor recovery to the back half of the year. Just making sure there's nothing else going on that's unusual in the second quarter.  When you get to the back half of the year, can you help us with that cadence thing and maybe help us out relative to normal seasonality? In other words, are you shifting that significant kind of sequential uptick into the third quarter? Is this more steady in the third quarter versus 2Q and then a more sizable uptick in the fourth quarter? Stephen Shamrock : I'll start with that from that perspective. If you look at the second quarter guide there, right, what I would tell you is what, you're what you're not seeing, again, is the weakness in electronics end market that's also weighing down the second quarter as well in the ATS segment. So, from that perspective, if I think about the second half, as Naga referenced earlier, the comps should get easier for sure from an ATS perspective, particularly with the expected pickup in the fourth quarter. So I think that's what gives us confidence there if we talk about seasonality and how that works from quarter to quarter, at least with respect to ATS. Michael Halloran : Can you just talk about the trends within ARAG and what's the expectations there? Just thinking kind of the impact. You've already given that. I'm more thinking, what are the underlying trends you're seeing? How does that compare on more of an organic basis in any context? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : Mike, that was on ARAG, right? On ARAG, I'll make couple of broad comments. Hopefully, I will answer the questions because I had little trouble hearing you completely. So if I don't answer all of your questions, please do follow up.  Integration is going very well. Great technology, great team, contributed to sales and the EBITDA margins. The differentiation of their product categories and the resulting gross margins all confirmed during our ownership of the business here. So, pretty excited about the business, how that is integrating. All is well from that point of view.  We also expect that ARAG to contribute 5%. There is no change there. A couple of things to remember about this business. Approximately 45% of the revenue is aftermarket parts in this business, right? So many of these parts are short life replacement cycle businesses, like nozzles that need to undergo more periodic replacement.  If you think about it, they sell mostly critical, low class components for their customers, which drive efficiency and reduce usage of material, costly fluids like fertilizers and chemicals.  And then the next point to remember about this business is we're not tied to people selling tractors. We're tied to folks that manufacture implements, implements that are used to spray, implements that are used to plant. And so, from that perspective, even when you defer a large CapEx spend, you definitely try to update and continuously able to have better implements, so that you can deliver on productivity and efficiency for an individual farmer or a farm organization.  We expect the business to be accretive on EBITDA to Nordson and slightly accretive to EPS when you exclude amortization. So, hopefully, that gave you a broad overview of that. Michael Halloran : The broad overview, all that makes sense. I think the question was a little bit more geared to just current trends and how you're seeing those trends materialize in the market. \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : In terms of demand trends, is that what you're talking about, Mike? Michael Halloran : Yes, sir. Because I certainly understand the contribution you're expecting, the 5%, certainly in the prepared remarks. I understand the long term component to it. I think just for the short term dynamics, particularly because [indiscernible] just curious how that's impacting you to knowing that you do have a sizable [Technical Difficulty]. \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : Europe is \u2013 the market is down. It does impact us a little bit, but not to the same extent as an implement \u2013 a big tractor manufacturer or an implement manufacturer since we are selling components. So it does have an impact, but not to the same extent, as you've heard in the Street around 15%, 20%. That's not what we're seeing in the business. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Andrew Buscaglia : Just wanted to confirm in that backlog, as it relates to ATS, can you see what's coming in Q4 through those orders from UV lights and electronics packaging or is it something else? I'm just trying to confirm your confidence that that converts? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : Probably two interrelated items that you mentioned, Andrew. First on the UV and the electronic packaging barrels, that's happening right now. They are smaller parts of the company, but they're very good early indicators because they serve \u2013 so if you think about an electronic manufacturer or a finished device manufacturer, you're going to pick up the slack by increasing your manufacturing consumables, right? You're not buying new lines, but you're increasing the usage of your existing lines. And so, you would normally see that in our consumable barrels, packaging businesses. That's what you're seeing. And we're seeing it right now.  On the UV light is the same way. We sell to people who make equipment that goes in the front end of the semiconductor, again, a small business, but a good early indicator that that our customers, who essentially play in the front end of the market, and Nordson doesn't play much there, it's a new opportunity for us, but it is early for us. So those two early indicators, that's what I meant by that.  In terms of our backlog, in couple of our test and inspection businesses, we have customer orders in place for shipments in third and fourth quarter. That is in our backlog. So, those are system backlog that is in the business that gives us confidence for a portion of the third and the fourth quarter shipments. And we do still expect order entry to pick up to fully deliver on the ATS expectations we have. Andrew Buscaglia : Naga, your margins have been great. A strong quarter. Ascend has really been successful. It's in the third year now. And I'm wondering how much more is left in the tank as it pertains to pricing and things like cost savings? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : Think of Ascend and NBS Next as a growth framework, rather than a cost play.  In terms of where we are \u2013 look, when you sort of implement and deploy a growth framework across a company, think about \u2013 this was all organically put together and built within the company. So three years, in my opinion, is still early innings. So what you're trying to do \u2013 NBS Next is now becoming the way we run the company, operate the company. So you're just beginning to see the benefits of the strategy being effective.  So in terms of \u2013 if you think about where are we at in terms of each of our divisions using it, I would say, three or four divisions delivering what we call leadership level performance. These are very specific metrics of quality, on time delivery, new product, vitality, customer growth, employee engagement. So there are five metrics within the company, I would say, and we call them leadership level performance. We have about four of our divisions at leadership level in most of those metrics. We have six or seven very closely following.  So what you're beginning to see is the impact of NBS Next and the Ascend strategy that is beginning to show up in our business. And IPS is a great example of that. These were some of the \u2013 a couple of the big divisions in IPS were the first places where we implemented the strategy and you can begin to see the performance on the organic growth side. So, our expectation is we're focused on growing the company organically, innovation, top customer growth. Clearly, we will have solid incrementals. Our expectation on organic growth is 40%. So by virtue of that, you're going to see some margin expansion, but that's not where we start. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey Hammond : Back on this Chinese New Year, is that pretty broad across the segments? Or is that going to be more focused on electronics? Stephen Shamrock : Jeff, I would tell you that most of that impact is concentrated in the IPS segment and to a lesser degree in ATS. Jeffrey Hammond : Naga, just on biopharma, it sounds like the destocking is behind us. That's what we're hearing, I guess, from some of the people in that space, but it doesn't sound like you're seeing any real order intake. As you talk to that customer base, what's kind of the visibility for that to start to inflect? \ufeff Sundaram Nagarajan : I think the way to think about it is, rather than giving you an exact timing, let me tell you what we fundamentally believe about this business. You're right, the destocking has come to a place where it is pretty much at the bottom of the cycle at a lower demand level, for sure. And that's what we're seeing in our businesses.  As we talk to our customers in general what we are talking about is for specific components they buy from us, what is their current inventory level. That is a better indicator of their future orders. And we are at that point where people are ordering \u2013 their ordering pattern has changed. That is one thing that we see in this. In the past, like other medical device manufacturing space is by \u2013 most of our biopharma customers will place blanket orders. That has changed. We no longer get blanket orders. Instead we get more regular book and ship kind of business. So that has changed. So, we're still working through this. But the more interesting part is we have some pretty nice growth in patient care. We have some pretty good growth in surgical applications, and so that's where we're beginning to see some pretty good order entry and pretty good shipment.  Nothing about biopharma has fundamentally changed. Single use plastics, transition from stainless steel to plastic, increased amount of biopharmaceuticals, all long term trends still intact, still favorable for the business. I'd love to be able to tell you when exactly this inflects. I just don't know. Operator : We have no further questions in our queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Naga for closing remarks. Operator : Our strong operating performance reflects the strength of our diversified end markets, close to the customer model, differentiated precision technology products and rigorous implementation of NBS Next growth framework. Again, I want to thank Nordson's employees for their commitment, which makes these results possible. And continued deployment of the Ascend strategy positions us well for long term growth.  Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Nordson Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Lara Mahoney. Please go ahead. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Stephen Shamrock, Chief Accounting Officer. We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, May 21st to report Nordson's fiscal 2024 second quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 30 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Tuesday, May 28th, 2024. During this conference call, we will make references to non-GAAP financial metrics. We've provided a reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metrics in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to materially differ. Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss second quarter highlights. He will then turn the call over to Steve to review sales and earnings performance for the total Company and the three business segments. Steve will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will then share a high level commentary about our end-markets and provide an update on the fiscal 2024 full year and third quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. Before we begin, I would like to welcome Dan Hopgood, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to Nordson. Dan started with us yesterday. He brings more than 25 years of financial and operational expertise to the CFO role. Prior to joining Nordson, he held roles of increasing responsibility at Eaton Corporation, a $23 billion multinational power management company. Most recently, he served as Eaton's Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. As I got to know Dan, I was impressed with his robust financial experience, his time as an operational leader and his passion for developing talent. Today, he will be listening in and we look forward to introducing him to all of you in the coming months starting at the KeyBanc Industrials and Basic Materials Conference in Boston next week. Now let's shift into our second quarter earnings results on Slide 5. At the outset, I would like to recognize the dedicated Nordson team, who have leveraged the NBS Next Growth Framework to deliver solid second quarter result. Sales of $651 million were within our second quarter guidance range. Growth was driven by the ARAG acquisition as well as strong performance in our Industrial Coatings and Fluid Solutions product lines, which offset continued weakness in our electronics product lines. In addition, our focus on top customers and differentiated products improved product mix. This focus and strategically adjusting costs led to improvements in gross margins and top quartile EBITDA margin of 31%. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.34, which was at the top end of our EPS guidance for the quarter. Finally, I'd like to highlight our second quarter free cash flow of $108 million, which was 92% of net income. We continue to convert earnings into cash flow and use this cash flow to retire nearly $100 million of debt within the quarter. I'll speak more about the enterprise performance in a few moments, but first, I'll turn the call over to Steve to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Stephen Shamrock : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 6, you'll see second quarter fiscal 2024 sales were $651 million, a slight increase to the prior year's second quarter sales of $650 million. This was driven by a favorable 5% benefit from the ARAG acquisition, partially offset by an organic sales decrease of 4% and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1%. As Naga referenced, strength in our Industrial Coating Systems and Fluid Solutions product lines were offset by an ongoing weakness in our electronics product lines. Gross profit performance was strong in the second quarter. We delivered gross profit margins in excess of 56%, an approximately 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Deploying our NBS Next Growth Framework, we are focusing on top products, driving a favorable product mix and product simplification efforts to improve manufacturing efficiency. We also remain disciplined on managing our cost structure and taking actions where necessary. EBITDA, adjusted for special items in both periods, totaled $203 million or 31% of sales, which was consistent with the prior year. Improved gross margins were offset by higher selling and administrative costs, attributable primarily to the addition of ARAG. Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense increased $9 million, associated with higher debt levels and increased interest rates. Other expenses net decreased $1 million, primarily related to lower foreign exchange losses compared to the prior year. Tax expense was $31 million for an effective tax rate of 21% in the quarter, which is in line with the prior year rate and our guidance range for 2024. Net income in the quarter totaled $118 million or $2.05 per share. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding $2 million of nonrecurring cost reduction actions and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $19 million totaled $2.34 per share, a 4% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings per share amount of $2.45. The decrease in earnings was driven primarily by higher interest expense due to the ARAG acquisition. Now let's turn to Slide 7 through 9 to review the second quarter 2024 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $367 million increased 9% compared to the prior year second quarter, driven by the ARAG acquisition, as well as increased sales in our industrial coating systems and packaging product lines. Organic sales increased 2% over the prior year second quarter, continuing to build upon a record fiscal 2023 for the segment, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 1%. This segment has now delivered organic growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters. EBITDA was $132 million in the second quarter or 36% of sales, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $119 million. The increase in EBITDA was driven primarily by the ARAG acquisition, plus organic sales growth and gross margin improvement in the base business. It's also worth highlighting that this quarter marks 13 out of 14 consecutive quarters of EBITDA growth. On Slide 8, you'll see Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $169 million increased 2% compared to the prior year second quarter, driven by modest growth in fluid and medical interventional solutions product lines. This was partially offset by lower sales in our medical fluid components product lines versus last year. Despite the year-over-year decrease, we did see a modest increase in the medical fluid component sales sequentially. Second quarter EBITDA was $63 million or 37% of sales, which was flat to the prior year EBITDA of $63 million, which excluded $1.5 million of special items for cost reduction actions. This segment has now delivered EBITDA margins greater than 35% in 13 of the last 14 quarters. Turning to Slide 9, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales were $115 million, a 22% decrease compared to the prior year second quarter. The decrease in sales was driven by continued weakness across the segment, primarily related to products serving electronics end-markets. Second quarter EBITDA was $24 million or 21% of sales, which trailed the prior year second quarter EBITDA of $32 million, which excluded special items of $2 million related to cost reduction actions in both periods. While the reduction in EBITDA was tied to the overall decrease in volume, favorable mix and cost reduction actions contributed to 22% decremental margins. This is well ahead of our decremental target of approximately 55%. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 10. At the end of the second quarter, we had cash of $125 million and net debt was $1.4 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.7 times based on the trailing 12 months EBITDA. We continue to have significant available borrowing capacity to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Free cash flow was $108 million or a 92% conversion rate on net income. We strategically deployed this strong cash flow in the quarter. We repaid $100 million of revolver debt and paid $39 million in dividends during the quarter. For modeling purposes for the full fiscal year, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 20% to 22%, capital expenditures of approximately $40 million to $50 million, and net interest expense of $74 million to $77 million. In summary, we delivered another strong financial performance in the second quarter in line with our expectations. We'll now move to Slide 11, and I'll turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thanks, Steve. I also want to commend the business for delivering strong operating performance under a challenging demand environment in some of our segments. This is a testament to how NBS Next is becoming the way we run our business. I want to spend a few minutes talking about our end-markets and the changes we are seeing as we move into the second half of fiscal 2024. Starting with Industrial Precision Solutions segment. We continue to see steadiness in industrial and consumer non-durable end-markets. After two years of record growth, our full year guidance implies IPS excluding ARAG is about flat to slightly up versus prior year. And while the ARAG integration continues to go well, we cannot ignore the impact of weakening agriculture and market conditions. Despite the weakening of this particular agricultural cycle, which is causing customers to pause spending and work through inventory, we are undeterred in our belief that precision agriculture is a high growth end-market and this cycle is temporary in nature. Based on the past nine months of integration, we remain excited about ARAG's differentiated technology and value proposition that will help customers boost crop yields while sustainably reducing the expensive usage of fertilizers and chemicals. Within our Medical and Fluid Solutions Segment, we are continuing to see modest order entry pickup in our fluid components business, which is returning to growth following last year's biopharma destocking. Similarly, our fluid solutions product lines, which have exposure to the electronic cycle, are turning positive. Our medical interventional solution product lines, which grew double-digits in fiscal 2023, driven by the trends in minimally invasive therapies and the aging of population, we have tough comparisons in the second half of the year. In the ATS segment, we continue to see positive early indicators of the electronic cycle inflection, but we're not seeing order entry pickup that would support the implied ramp in our prior second half guidance, keeping in mind, the semiconductor sub-segment, Nordson applications are largely positioned at the back end of the manufacturing process with a focus on advanced packaging of semiconductor chips. Currently, investments are being made in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process related to fabrication and processing of silicon wafers. As production shifts towards converting the wafers to individual chips and advanced packaging of these chips, customers will invest in Nordson Electronics dispense and test and inspection technology. Overall, we will benefit from the increasing demand for chips in support of AI, automotive electronics, onshoring, CHIPS Act and more. While our test and inspection businesses are positioned to improve the yields and ensure quality of these critical and expensive CHIPS, our X-ray business, which experienced double-digit growth in fiscal 2023 is dealing with challenging comparisons in the second half of the year. Our ATS leaders continue to do an excellent job of implementing the NBS Next Growth Framework and positioning themselves for future growth. This includes positioning operations closer to the customer, introducing differentiated new products and making strategic cost adjustments. ATS ability to outperform their decremental targets again this quarter is a testament to this work. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 12. We enter the third quarter with approximately $700 million in backlog. This backlog remains concentrated in our systems businesses while customer order entry patterns have returned to historical norms in the rest of the businesses. Based on the current visibility I just shared and order entry trends, we are updating our previously issued full year revenue guidance in the range of flat to up 2% over record fiscal 2023. Full year fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to be in the range of down 5% to down 1% per diluted share. This full year guidance assumes a neutral impact from FX rates and the ARAG acquisition contributing approximately 3.5% growth at the midpoint of our guidance. Investors should keep in mind that we anniversary the acquisitive growth impact of ARAG in the fiscal fourth quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, sales are forecasted to be in the range of $645 million to $670 million with adjusted earnings in the range of $2.25 per diluted share to $2.40 per diluted share. Third quarter guidance considers weaker electronics and agriculture end-markets. Even as we face more challenging market conditions, Nordson's core strength remain a diversified portfolio close to the customer business model, high level of recurring revenue, NBS Next Growth Framework and a commitment to innovation. All of this positions Nordson well to deliver long-term Ascend Strategy goals. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that, we will pause, and Steve and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Stephen Shamrock : Good morning, Mike. Michael Halloran : So a couple of questions here. Naga, maybe you could just talk to what's assumed in guidance as you work through the year from an end-market recovery? I certainly understand the electronics piece and the ag piece. You look at the implied fourth quarter ramp, it's still probably a little above seasonality. So wondering if you still have some of those systems and projects hitting in the fourth quarter or if that's been pushed to next year? And thoughts about any sustainability of the packaging piece and how you think the biopharma is going to recover? So basically just maybe lay out how you think the end-markets track as we work through the remainder of the year and what's assumed in guidance? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, let's get started with IPS. The guidance really -- maybe start with the first two big hits and then we'll go through the end-markets, Mike. So the first -- the two factors which you highlighted is that, we're not seeing the pickup in orders for electronic systems that we had expected with the implied second half ramp. So that's number one. Number two is the agriculture cycle is having a greater impact on ARAG than our own expectation. So timing is just -- there is not enough time here to achieve the ramp we had originally expected. In terms of end-markets, if you think about IPS non-ARAG, our expectation is going to be flat to slight growth following record two years. In terms of -- ARAG continues to contribute to the growth of the business. In terms of ATS, certainly the growths are below our long-term growth rates. We're not seeing the pickup as we talked about. In terms of Medical Fluid Solutions, our expectation is that our fluid components business will be slightly up. Our fluid solutions business would also be slightly up offset by tough comps on the interventional components. So in summary, you're going to have IPS flat to slightly up, ATS down, MFS returning to growth slightly. Michael Halloran : So thanks for that. Following up on that then, are you assuming any sort of pickup in some of those stressed markets or any sort of backlog let out in any of those stressed markets in the fourth quarter? In other words, just trying to understand how derisked some of those stressed points are in the guidance as we work through the rest of the year? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. What I'll tell you is that, if you think about our fourth quarter is does not expect -- does not require electronics to come back, does not expect ARAG to come back. So if you think about those two stressed markets. But what is expected though is sequential continued improvement in both these markets. So we saw that in second quarter, both electronics, ATS is sequentially up. And so that's our expectation. Michael Halloran : So in other words, the sequentials from here are relatively stable versus a normal sequential pattern in your mind in those markets? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Stephen Shamrock : Mike. Sundaram Nagarajan : What we're seeing is order entry. Yeah, go ahead, Steve, maybe provide some more. Stephen Shamrock : No, I was going to say, Mike, that I think you're spot on there, because if you also look at sequential growth, we had 11% growth last year from Q3 to Q4, and our midpoint basically implies around 8% growth this year. So Q4 is usually seasonally our strongest quarter. So I think that aligns with how we're thinking about it. Michael Halloran : Great. Really appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky with Jefferies. Please go ahead. James Heaney : Good morning. This is James on for Saree. Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to kind of follow up on the ARAG. So can you kind of provide more color on kind of increased pressure? Because I know you guys said that you guys have a high recurring revenue here. And kind of when do you expect to see an inflection point in the ag market? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : In general, this market is expected to be down this year. And we expect this turnaround sometime in '25, but we're not really giving any guidance on '25. So difficult to tell you exactly when that will happen. But our guidance does not imply any pickup in ag, agriculture markets this year. James Heaney : Got it. And kind of wanted to follow up on the, like the strong gross margin performance here, like despite flat revenue growth. So how should we think about like gross margin for the remainder of the year? Thank you. Stephen Shamrock : Yeah. No. So what I would tell you and that really kind of ties back to our, what I would call, very strong Q2 performance, right? Basically, from a sales standpoint with Q2, we came in really where we expected from a sales standpoint. We came in with $651 million of sales in Q2. And that was -- when we gave the guidance for Q2, we assumed currency neutral. So if you add back about a $5 million unfavorable impact of FX, we basically came in spot on near the midpoint of our guidance. And we actually were at the high end of our guidance in Q2 because of the gross margin performance that you referenced there. And the way I would think about that is we really had a strong performance in margins for a number of factors in Q2, right? We had a very strong mix, I would tell you in Q2, whether it was parts versus sales that was very strong. We had good customer mix and even mix within product lines. And also had, we referenced in our earlier comments, manufacturing efficiencies and cost controls. How I would think about gross margins going forward? I think I mentioned this on a previous call, we're not focused on gross margin expansion. Our long-term focus is really to maintain the gross margins that we have. So I do think what you saw in Q2 was a mix than normal. So that's how I would think about that going forward. I wouldn't expect as favorable of a mix in the balance of the year. James Heaney : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just a question on ARAG. I remember back to when you did the call, is it related to the acquisition? You seem pretty convinced that this business would be less impacted by a down ag cycle, and clearly, that's not the case here. So what I guess have you learned over the last couple of quarters about ARAG and how indeed tied to the cycle that business seemingly is? And to that point, you mentioned inventory destocking. I assume that's at the OEM level. But correct me if I'm wrong. How long do you think that destock lasts? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, you're right, Matt, in that, our expectations that this business would have been less muted because of the precision ag exposure, certainly did not play out the way our expectations were. But look, what is really important to remember is, we still like the technology. We like the people we have added to the organization. Certainly a very interesting end-market. If you look at expectations of some of the OEMs, the precision ag itself is down or expected to be down 20%, 25%. So even if you think about our expectations where precision AG was going to continue to grow through the cycle, that has not worked out the way it is. In terms of inventory destocking, remember, 40% of this business is aftermarket parts. And those aftermarket parts go through distribution. They're not direct sale. So they don't go through the OEM, they go through a distributor, and there is some level of inventory destocking that is going on in ARAG. Matt Summerville : Got it. With respect to, you'd mentioned kind of last conference call, the Canary businesses, and I mean that in a positive light, with respect to electronics showing some signs of life. Are you concerned that maybe those are no longer good leading indicators for a broader upturn in the electronics side? And could you maybe just put a finer point on how those businesses, those Canary businesses, if you will, performed in the second quarter and how inbound order activity has been looking there? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. Both the businesses continue to strengthen in the trends that we mentioned in our first quarter. So we're continuing -- we remain convinced, both those are very good leading indicators. And the reason, I'll tell you is those are two separate indicators. For example, the one we talked about was the UV lamp businesses, a niche product line in one of our businesses. That is in the front end of the semiconductor process where we sell to large machine builders. That continues to strengthen, the forecasts have actually increased. That lines up with what you see front end semiconductors growing nicely. So you see that. But you also see on finished electronic products, you're continuing to see greater usage of existing lines. So this is the consumables from EFD. Those continue to strengthen. So both those are still strong. I think what it is not getting translated is that you would immediately see a system business pickup. And that's the translation that is getting delayed. We're not concerned that this is -- this doesn't indicate that the cycle is going to turn. It is more an uncertainty in this CapEx spend in electronics that we are seeing. So it is more related to the CapEx investment rather than does the cycle has not turned or not. So hopefully, that helps you. Matt Summerville : Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Stephen Shamrock : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : Well, I wanted to follow up on a little different cross section for the electronic cycle. I'm curious if you could speak directly to the differences you're seeing in electronics processing versus T&I broadly? And then if any interesting nuances in the different test and inspection modalities? Sundaram Nagarajan : Okay. All right. I think if you -- let's just first start with EPS and T&I. EPS systems continued to be -- in the quarter continued to be lower in line with the ATS levels, right? So down 20% or so. And in the T&I business, I'll remind you that last year, we had some significant growth in those business. So what we are facing on our X-ray business is a tough comp. Among the other T&I business on our optical business, we have our sensors that go into the front end of the market, which is called a wafer sense product line, that is continuing to grow nicely. It is a small part of the business, but it is growing nicely. The acoustic test and inspection part of the business is also growing, which is more on the front end and on some new memory applications. The optical side, the parts are fine, the systems are behind. So we fundamentally still believe the test and inspection business will be lower declines when compared to our dispense business. What you've got mixed in there is some tough comps in our X-ray business. In all of these cases, the teams are doing an incredible job, doing three things. One, they are certainly strengthening their delivery and quality performances. They're moving manufacturing closer to our customers. So we've got a new manufacturing and distribution location coming up in India to support our electronic customers who are shifting focus into India. Third, we have very exciting new products that are being released by our test and inspection business. Our new MXI Liner products are well received in the marketplace. We've got a new updated software for our AXI business that is hitting the market. And in our dispense business, you certainly see our vantage product as well as new coating product lines, again, all hitting the market. So we're using this time to really position the business for growth. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks. And then a similar one in IPS. Wondering if you could go into the state of phasing of demand and comparisons for the polymer and adhesives general assembly pieces. I think coatings stood out as maybe the strongest piece in the quarter for non-ARAG IPS. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, our coatings business is doing an incredible market demand and really delivering on the growth opportunities. So we're very happy about the performance there. If you think about our adhesive business in general, 12 out of 13 quarters or 12 out of 14 quarters, we have been growing. So pretty strong growth. Our expectation is still, as we finish the year, we would be flat to slightly up. So that is in a good spot. Particularly our packaging part of our business is doing incredibly well. If you think about our plastics business, again, you've had record growth in those businesses for the last two years. And this year, they would face some tough comp and so that will be slightly lower. We don't talk about sales by individual divisions, but generally speaking, what I will tell you is our plastic business is slightly lower -- slightly lower than their record last two years, right? So hopefully, that gives you enough color around the different businesses. Christopher Glynn : Yeah, terrific. Thank you, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : And one last thing I would add in our adhesive business, certainly, parts are significantly up when compared to our system businesses. This is some of the -- this is one of the reasons when we talk -- when Steve talks about sales mix, certainly, this was very helpful. Christopher Glynn : Yeah, you're saying less system sales in the quarter was sort of neutralized by really strong recurring revenue growth? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes, recurring revenue growth. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Christopher Dankert : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just return to ARAG for a moment. Given that agriculture markets kind of come off peak here, is there any risk around the expected synergies for that deal? And maybe just how do we think about the cost structure of that business in the context of the current slowdown here? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, I think there are, if you remember, when we acquired ARAG, this is a complete new division for the Company. Hence, there were no cost synergies baked into our valuation model. It was mostly based on our ability to continue to grow with the market. Clearly, with the market being down and our own expectations that it wouldn't follow the market, not panning out the way we had expected, certainly puts the sales part of our plan behind. But I'd still remind you, great technology, great end-market with precision agriculture, long-term solid growth opportunities for us as a Company, market leader in Europe, market leader in South America, two big geographies. Certainly, we have opportunities as we think about North America. We fully acknowledge that our existing competitors will do a nice job in North America, but we do believe that is an opportunity for us to continue to think about it. Christopher Dankert : I think that was just kind of my -- the crux of my question. When you brought it on board, there was no really expectation of a slowdown. There was no cost side to the economics there, I guess, has that. It doesn't sound like that has changed. It sounds like we're just going to kind of manage through here. We're not contemplating any sort of adjustment to the decrementals on that business? Sundaram Nagarajan : No. If you think about this business, even with the reduction in revenue, their profit margins are north of the Company's margins. Christopher Dankert : Got it. Got it. Perfect. Thank you so much for the color there. And I think just for my follow-up, on the electronics side of the business, particularly on the electronics processing within ATS, the shorthand, at least for me, has always kind of been that's the handset cycle. Is there anything else that's kind of weighing down that business right now beyond handsets or is that still kind of the main driver there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Chris, I mean, over the last four years, five years, we certainly have moved away from the handset as an important driver in that business. Handset is still a small part of the business, but really, semiconductor advanced packaging is where this business is growing, and in components such as camera modules and things like that. Automotive electronics also has become a bigger part of the business. So it's no longer just a handset business, it is semiconductor, automotive electronics, and a small handset presence still. Christopher Dankert : Got it. Yeah, well, thanks so much for the color, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Seaport Research. Please go ahead. Walter Liptak : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And, yeah, I just want to try a couple of follow-ups on ARAG. You talked about the market in Europe, Latin America. Are all the markets getting hit the same way by the cycle? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yes. If you look at some of the market reports that are out there, pretty much across the world, the market cycle seems to be in that down 20% to 25%, and that is North America, that is Europe, that is South America and even precision ag, which was typically a growth engine. Walter Liptak : Okay, thanks for that. And then a follow-up is that -- is the precision ag market is -- what's different about this cycle, where precision ag is slowing? Is it related to destocking or something? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think that is some amount of destocking, but that is also -- we are -- I tell you our knowledge of agriculture when compared to our knowledge of electronics or industrial non-durable is sort of -- obviously, we've been in this business for a short period of time, so our knowledge is not as deep as we would have in other end-markets, but our understanding is that there is some amount of destocking, but there is certainly some hesitancy in investing in large implements even. And so that is what you're seeing is that reduction in OEM. And this is unique, because as we looked at this business and evaluated it, one of the things we were -- we did a lot of work around is to understand the relationship between cycle and this business's performance. And this seems a little bit unique when compared to their prior performance. So we're still figuring it out, but I will tell you that it is impacting us more than we had expected. And it is impacting us and that's what our current situation is. And we still like the products. We still like the people. We're still working on continuing to integrate the business, which is going really well. And I think that's kind of where we are at with ARAG. Walter Liptak : Okay, great. Thank you for that color. And just as the -- I guess a follow-up question is on the electronics part of the business. You mentioned that there's a timing issue between the front end and the back end. Can you help educate us just how long is that? Is it measured in months or years? How should we think of that? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, we don't -- by now, right, look, based on our expectations in the first quarter, we had expected that this would follow quickly or thereafter. That has not happened. So our guidance doesn't imply a significant pickup in electronic market for the rest of the year. And as we approach 2025, we will be in a better place to provide you more color as to when it might actually pick up. But I think what is important to remember is that we have derisked our outlook for electronics for the rest of the year. Walter Liptak : Okay. That sounds great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Hello. Andrew Buscaglia : I wanted to go back to the ATS segment. Just given the nature of Nordson having a more direct sales model, it gives investors a lot of confidence in what you guys are saying. But what is that these customers are saying to you that's making it so difficult to predict when the spend is going to move forward? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think it's a great question, Andrew. What I will tell you is that none of the projects we are working on with our customers that somebody come to us and said, look, this is all off the table, it is canceled. That is not the case. We continue to work with our customers on projects and opportunities as they bring on new technologies for AI, as they bring on more technologies for much smaller, much more complicated chips than we had. So that work, the project work continues, but what it is not translated is from that project work into system orders, it is not translated yet, nor have people completely canceled projects either, right? So we are sort of in this middle time, call it uncertainty, and I can only talk to you about what we're seeing in terms of customer sort of actions rather than what is the broader trend here. There seems to be a reluctance in translating work that they're doing into systems sales or systems orders, right? We continue to do well on our parts, but there seems to be some reluctance, and not exactly understand the core reasons as to why our customers have reluctance, but there is reluctance. Andrew Buscaglia : Maybe to dig in a little bit deeper, regionally is there something unusual going on like, is one region worse than the other? And I'm thinking China here. I don't know just, what are you seeing by geography, I guess? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, we're not seeing significantly different behavior from geography, geography. We still -- we work with all of the major semiconductor manufacturers. There are -- it's not like -- obviously, we continue to sequentially grow. Sequentially, we have better order entry. So it is not like we're continuing to decline or we're not -- we're just flat in the bottom. We're starting to come out. It is just not as fast as we had hoped. I think that is probably what you need to take away is that our reduction in guidance is mainly because we had a far steeper implied ramp in our second half. That's not happening. And that is not happening because the orders we are getting are not at the same rate as we had hoped. It is at a little flatter rate than we had hoped for. And we don't see a whole lot of difference in regions. Clearly, when compared to last year, activity in Asia has picked up that we can tell you, right? Certainly, Southeast Asia is better than China for us, and that's just for us. Certainly, our automotive, electronics customers in Mexico are significantly better for us. Europe is okay. So that's -- broadly that's how we think about the ATS business. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Thanks, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, so just if we step back and think about capital allocation, I think you guys have kind of been on the wrong side of cycle timing around CyberOptics and ARAG now. And I'm just wondering how you think about cyclicality and timing as you kind of look at deals going forward? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think it's a fair question and we have spent time thinking about this. We certainly need to put that into part of our equation as we think about acquisitions and deals. But having said that, I would tell you the technology behind each of these deals are spot on for us as a Company to continue to expand our portfolio of precision technologies. We certainly have short-term pressure because of the market conditions, but we believe that the long-term drivers in both these spaces are pretty sound and we like the technologies we have and the people we've added. Finally, what I'll tell you, it's not offered as an excuse, if you so will, right? But it is -- we really don't control when high-quality assets come to market. We continue to remain focused on our strategy of building strong precision technology portfolio, continue to deploy NBS Next. And we believe the long-term strategic fit of these businesses, and I know as we get past these market conditions, we're going to be incredibly happy that these are part of Nordson portfolio. So I think it's a fair question you asked, but that's what we're working on. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Appreciate the color there, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. Jeffrey Hammond : Just on decremental margins in the second half, I mean, you guys have done a pretty good job with NBS Next kind of limiting the decrementals, but I think at least in our model initially, we have pretty severe decrementals. So just maybe how you're thinking about decrementals and holding the line? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. If you think about decrementals, I think we think about decrementals inside the Company mostly for our core businesses that is probably the best apples-to-apples comparison. And if you look at our core business apples-to-apples decrementals were pretty strong in the quarter. But if you look at the total companies, given ARAG performance where you have lower sales, yet you have the full load of SG&A, your decrementals at the total Company level will look skewed. But without ARAG, we had some pretty strong decrementals. And if you're looking for a number -- you're looking for a number, sorry, Steve, you want to go at that? Stephen Shamrock : Yeah, no, no, I was just going to say, Jeff, what I'd also focus on too is just our EBITDA margins as well, right? I mean, we -- I think we've been very successful in terms of generating strong EBITDA margins. I mean, even Q2 is the fifth quarter in a row where we had EBITDA margins, 31% or higher. And the last three years, we've delivered 30% or more EBITDA margins. And I think we're obviously well on our way to do that again here in 2024. Sundaram Nagarajan : And in the core businesses, Jeff, if you're asking for, what is a target decremental, it is about 50 to 55. I would use 55, which is sort of in line with our gross margins, because we want to stay invested in our precision technology innovation, we want to stay invested in our direct customer model. That is what we have done in the past and that's what we will continue to do. But if you really put all of this in perspective, right? If you look at our full year, we're still -- our midpoint is -- essentially implies a 1% growth over a record 2023. We're still expecting that we will deliver 31% plus EBITDA margins. We will still convert pretty strong on net income to free cash flow. In the quarter, we converted about 92%. So from an operational perspective, yes, the teams are dealing with some market conditions, but the operational performance of the Company is in a pretty good place and we continue to do that in this environment. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, great. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Naga for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Sundaram Nagarajan : Our solid second quarter operating performance reflects the strength of our diversified markets, close to the customer model, differentiated precision technologies and rigorous implementation of NBS Next Growth Framework. We remain focused on the deployment of the Ascend Strategy that positions us well for long-term profitable growth. With that in mind, we are excited to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Day in New York on Thursday, October 3rd, 2024. We'll be sharing more information about the details of the event this summer, but please save the date on your calendars for the afternoon of October 3rd. Again, I want to thank Nordson's employees for their commitment, which makes these results possible. Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Lara Mahoney. Please begin. Lara Mahoney : Thank you. Good morning. This is Lara Mahoney, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. I'm here with Sundaram Nagarajan, our President and CEO; and Dan Hopgood, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We welcome you to our conference call today, Thursday, August 22nd, to report Nordson's fiscal 2024 third quarter results. You can find both our press release as well as our webcast slide presentation that we will refer to during today's call on our website at www.nordson.com/investors. This conference call is being broadcast live on our investor website and will be available there for 30 days. There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until Thursday, August 29th, 2024. During this conference call, we will make references to non-GAAP financial metrics. We've provided a reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to Slide 2 of our presentation, where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to materially differ. Moving to today's agenda on Slide 3, Naga will discuss third quarter highlights as well as yesterday's close of our Atrion Medical acquisition. He will then turn the call over to Dan to review sales and earnings performance for the total company and the three business segments. Dan will also discuss the balance sheet and cash flow. Naga then will share a high-level commentary about our end market and provide an update on the fiscal 2024 full year guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2024 third quarter conference call. Before I begin, I'm pleased with the closure of the Atrion Medical acquisition as we announced in a press release issued yesterday morning. I would like to welcome our new colleagues from Atrion into the Nordson family. Atrion's products will expand our current portfolio in medical fluid components and interventional solutions by adding a category leader in infusion fluid delivery and niche cardiovascular therapy products. Atrion expands Nordson's fluid components addressable market by more than 50% by adding products and solutions for infusion therapies and drug delivery. This also extends our current offering to top medical device customers and broadens Nordson's exposure to higher growth medical end markets with significant single use consumables with recurring revenue streams. Going forward, Atrion will be part of our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment. Now let's shift to our third quarter earnings results on Slide 5. At the outset, I would like to recognize the dedicated Nordson team who had leveraged the NBS Next growth framework to deliver strong operating results. Sales of $662 million were in line with our expectations, driven by IPS segment, which delivered strong organic growth of 4% in addition to increased sales from our ARAG acquisition. This growth was partially offset by continued softness in electronics compared to prior year, as well as lower demand impacting our medical businesses. In addition, our focus on top customers and differentiated products improved consolidated product mix. This strategic focus and a commitment to managing costs led to improvements in gross margins and top quartile EBITDA margin of over 31%. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.41, which is up $0.08 from the midpoint of our guidance. Finally, I'd like to highlight our third quarter free cash flow of $143 million, which was 122% of net income. We continue to generate strong cash flow and execute a balanced capital deployment strategy with $39 million in dividends paid, $25 million in share repurchases and $40 million in debt reduction during the quarter. I'll speak more about the enterprise performance in few moments, but first, I'll turn the call over to Dan to provide a detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter. Daniel Hopgood : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. On Slide number 6, you'll see third quarter fiscal 2024 sales were $662 million, up 2% from prior year third quarter sales of $649 million and in line with the midpoint of our quarterly guidance. This was driven by a 4% increase from the ARAG acquisition, partially offset by an overall organic sales decrease of 1% and unfavorable currency translation of 1%. As Naga mentioned, we saw growth in our IPS segment organic sales during the quarter, in particular our packaging and nonwovens divisions, which were offset by softness in certain electronics and medical product lines. Gross profit during the quarter remained strong at 56% of sales. Deploying our NBS Next growth framework, we're focusing on top products, driving a favorable product mix, while also continuing to improve our manufacturing efficiency. EBITDA adjusted for special items in both periods, totaled $208 million for the quarter or 31.5% of sales, slightly below the prior year by about 50 basis points, which was driven by higher selling and administrative costs, including the first-year impact of the ARAG acquisition. Looking at non-operating expenses, net interest expense increased approximately $6 million associated with higher debt levels tied to the ARAG acquisition. Other income on a net basis decreased by $2 million, primarily reflecting certain foreign exchange transactional variations compared to the prior year. Tax expense for the quarter was $32 million or an effective rate of about 21.5%, which is in line with the prior year rate and our guidance range for 2024. Net income in the quarter totaled $117 million or $2.04 per share, excluding $8 million of non-recurring costs related to the Atrion acquisition and selected restructuring charges, as well as $19 million in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter totaled $2.41, $0.08 above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance, but a 6% decrease from the prior year adjusted earnings per share of $2.55. The decrease in year-over-year earnings reflects the slightly lower operating margins and increased interest expense I just walked through. Now let's turn to Slides 7 through 9 to review the third quarter 2024 segment performance. Industrial Precision Solution sales of $371 million increased 10% compared to the prior year third quarter. The ARAG acquisition contributed 7% sales growth while organic sales were up 4% year-over-year, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of 1%. Organic sales improved across most of our product lines with particular strength in packaging and nonwovens. It's important to note that these results continue to build upon record fiscal 2023 revenue for the IPS segment, which has now delivered organic growth in 13 of the last 15 quarters. EBITDA for the segment was $135 million in the third quarter or 36% of sales, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $122 million. The increase in EBITDA was driven by the ARAG acquisition and strong contribution from our organic sales growth. It's also worth highlighting that this quarter marks 14 out of 15 consecutive quarters of EBITDA growth for the IPS segment. Turning to Slide 8, you'll see Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $167 million, decreased 2% compared to the prior year's third quarter, driven by lower demand in our medical interventional solutions and fluid components product lines. While the biopharma portion of our fluid components product lines has stabilized, other product applications for patient care and surgical applications are adjusting to more conservative customer order entry patterns. This is despite solid underlying demand for patient procedures. These decreases were also partially offset by improved sales in our fluid solutions product lines versus last year. EBITDA for Medical and Fluid Solutions was $62 million for the quarter or 37% of sales, which was a 9% reduction to the prior year EBITDA of $68 million. The decrease was driven by lower volume and unfavorable product mix during the quarter. In spite of these recent growth headwinds, the segment has now delivered EBITDA margins greater than 35% in 14 of the last 15 quarters. Turning to Slide 9, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales were $124 million, an 11% decrease compared to the prior year third quarter. The decrease includes 10% organic volume decline as well as unfavorable currency translation of 1%. The decrease in sales was driven by electronics processing and x-ray and test product lines, offset by growth in our optical sensors businesses. While we expected weakness year-over-year, segment sales increased over 8% sequentially versus Q2 and we continue to see modest improvement in order intake as the semiconductor and electronic applications we serve continue to show signs of improvement. Third quarter EBITDA was $26 million or 21% of sales, below prior year third quarter EBITDA of $33 million, which excluded special items of $2 million related to cost reduction actions in the prior year. While the reduction in EBITDA was tied to the overall decrease in volume, favorable mix and cost reduction actions contributed to achieving a 41% decremental on the lower year-over-year sales. This is well ahead of our decremental target of approximately 55%. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide 10. At the end of the third quarter, we had cash on hand of $165 million and net debt was $1.3 billion, resulting in a leverage ratio of about 1.6 times based on trailing 12 months EBITDA. Pro forma for the Atrion acquisition that we just announced, net debt will rise to about $2.2 billion and our leverage ratio will increase to approximately 2.5 times in the near-term, which remains within our targeted range. We funded the Atrion acquisition with a $500 million term loan, cash on hand and borrowings on our revolver. We plan to refinance the term loan in the public bond markets and we'll continue to use cash from operations to repay our revolver borrowings over time. After the acquisition, we still have greater than 50% availability on our revolver and greater than $600 million of liquidity available to the company, including cash on hand. Our free cash flow generation continues to be a strength at $143 million during the quarter or 122% conversion rate on net income. As we continue to strategically deploy this strong cash flow, as Naga mentioned earlier, we reduced debt by $40 million in the quarter, paid $39 million in dividends and repurchased $25 million in shares, all while continuing to fund capital and product development investments for growth. Notably, last week, we announced our 61st year of increasing our annual dividend, building upon our legacy of growing capital returns as we grow the company. All-in-all, we had a solid quarter and we're well positioned to close out the year. With that, let's turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thanks, Dan. I also want to congratulate the Nordson team for delivering strong operating performance under a challenging demand environment in select businesses. Let's spend a few minutes talking about our end markets as we move into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Starting with our Industrial Precision Solutions segment, we continue to see steadiness in industrial and consumer non-durable end markets with nonwovens starting to pick up in the third quarter. After two years of record growth, our full year guidance implies IPS, excluding ARAG, is about flat to modestly up versus prior year. ARAG sales appear to be normalizing at lower levels at this point in the agriculture cycle. In general, we feel confident about the diversification of this segment, its mix of recurring revenue and customer intimate business model. Within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, medical device customer supply chain teams are being far more cautious with their inventory purchases after a very unique few years. While we are starting to see lower demand in the interventional solutions and certain fluid component product lines outside of biopharma, we are confident in the long-term growth drivers in this end market, including aging of the population, rising chronic health conditions, trends toward non-invasive surgical techniques, and increased healthcare spending and procedure volumes. We have a robust pipeline of longer-term customer project activity and we are comfortable with the future outlook of this business. Near term, we expect softness in certain medical product lines, particularly in light of challenging year-over-year comparisons for medical interventional solutions product lines. Staying close to our customers, we are working our way through what has been a one-of-a-kind demand environment over the past few years. The ATS segment will benefit from increasing demand for advanced chips in support of AI, automotive electronics, onshoring, CHIPS Act, as well as the broader electronics CapEx spending cycle. We are beginning to experience a sequential and year-over-year increase in order entry in the test and inspection applications. For example, we're pleased with the momentum in our optical, CyberOptics and acoustic test and inspection product lines. Our x-ray product lines, which experienced double-digit growth in fiscal 2023, continued to deal with challenging comparisons in the fourth quarter. Electronics dispense product line applications are largely in the back end of manufacturing of advanced semiconductor chips. Demand for these products occur later in the cycle. Given the sequential improvement in revenues and order entry, we expect the ATS segment to return to growth in 2025. Turning now to our outlook on Slide 12. We enter the fourth quarter with approximately $650 million in backlog. This backlog remains concentrated in our systems businesses, while customer order entry patterns have returned to historical norms in the rest of the businesses. Based on current visibility and order entry trends, we are holding our previously issued full year base business revenue guidance in the range of flat up to 2% over record fiscal 2023. The addition of Atrion will then increase our base sales by approximately $30 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. Full year fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $9.45 to $9.65 per diluted share for fiscal 2024. This is unchanged at the midpoint despite the inclusion of the slightly dilutive impact of Atrion in the fourth quarter. This full year guidance assumes a neutral impact from foreign exchange rates. Investors should keep in mind that we anniversary the acquisitive growth impact of ARAG in the fiscal fourth quarter. Even as we face challenging demand conditions in certain end markets, Nordson's core strengths remain a diversified portfolio close to the customer business model, high level of recurring revenue, NBS Next growth framework and a commitment to innovation. These core strengths enable Nordson to deliver high-quality operating performance under varying economic conditions. We're looking forward to sharing an update on our long-term growth plans, including our capital deployment strategy, at our upcoming Investor Day in New York on October 3rd. We hope to see you there and we encourage you to use the QR code in the webcast presentation to register. As always, I want to thank our customers, shareholders and the Nordson team for your continued support. With that, we will pause and take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Saree Boroditsky from Jefferies. Your line is open. Saree Boroditsky : Hi. Good morning. I want to focus a little bit on the acquisition. So the margins at Atrion, they've come down rather significantly from since 2022. Could you just talk about the right margin profile for this business and the steps you're taking to get the margins to Nordson levels? Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Saree. The business has gone through supply chain issues and certainly have had to go through some issues, and so the margins have degraded for them in the last couple of years, as you can see in the public information. We fundamentally believe if you look at past track record of this business, their EBITDA margins are in line with Nordson-like margins. And so we're fully confident that we would be able to return the business back to those same margins over time. Saree Boroditsky : Appreciate that. And then you noted that you saw year-over-year growth in some of the test and inspection products on an order basis. Could you just quantify this and then provide some additional color on what's driving this improvement and how you see that expanding into 2025? Thank you. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Thank you, Saree. We see some pretty strong momentum in our optical and acoustic product lines. So optical is our CyberOptics business. What you find there is a lot of these applications are in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing business. But also this is the business in terms of cyclicality was the first one to experience a downturn early last year, right. So you have the cycle helping us. But in addition, you have some exciting new products like our WaferSense that is used in the semiconductor processing manufacturing steps. And so you have a combination of new products, cycle and where our products are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. So the momentum is pretty good. This business continues to have a pretty nice year-on-year growth from last year. So we're pretty excited about what we see in this business. Saree Boroditsky : Appreciate the questions. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Canyon Hayes : Good morning. You've got Canyon Hayes on for Matt Summerville today. So I just wanted to start with a quick review on implied guidance in the fourth quarter. And I was curious how your thoughts might have progressed relative to the prior quarter on IPS, ATS and MFS organic growth? Daniel Hopgood : So thanks for the -- Canyon Hayes : Yeah, could you -- Daniel Hopgood : Go ahead. I guess as far as our thoughts, if you look at our underlying guidance, we pretty much -- we're holding the base business. And so I would say our thoughts are things are playing. The year is playing out about as expected for the fourth quarter. But maybe you can give me a little bit more color behind your question. Canyon Hayes : I apologize. I think I might have cut out there, but I think I got what I needed there. Okay. Across the broader industrial space, we've seen project activity get pushed out a little bit as a function of rates, macro, geopolitical election concerns. I'd be curious if we could get a little bit of color on how or how that is not affecting Nordson and how we should think about how that implies into the 2025? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Obviously, we're not talking about 2025. So I want to make sure you know we will have a chance to talk about it in a couple of months from now. But as we think about end market conditions within the company as it stands today, it's good to remind ourselves Nordson has a very diversified portfolio, diversified in end markets, diversified in geography, diversified in systems and consumables or recurring revenues, right? So that's an important piece of the puzzle here. So if you think about segment by segment, what we see here in IPS is a business non-ARAG without our ag business. Think of that as a slight growth to flattish after two record years, 13 out of 15 quarters year-on-year organic growth, right. So I think that's an important context to remember. We see order entry to be pretty steady. And so our expectation is this part of our business remains steady. There are a couple of things that if you want to add a little bit more color to our IPS segment, our recurring revenue is pretty high here, right. It is north of 50%. And you expect when folks are sort of deferring CapEx spend, they are going to increase their recurring revenues, right. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it is you have a couple of our businesses like the nonwovens, where we see some pretty good order entry pickup. And so that is certainly helping this business. One thing to remember is that you do have other sort of large CapEx spends around big trends looking like electric battery vehicles still activity, although the overall market is down. You have automotive electronics, fabric bonding, recapitalization of our base, reshoring, e-commerce packaging. So a number of trends that are helping us to make small wins. So these are not big home runs like we like to call them. These are singles and doubles, but that's what this segment is about. It is about working on end market applications and winning those application by application. So a steady outlook for IPS helped by recurring revenues. On ATS, we do see order entry starting to pick up. We are being cautious here. This is an end market that has been cyclical, but we are modestly seeing order entry pickup. We saw a sequential revenue growth in this segment when compared to last quarter. And so that is coming back and we talked a little bit about optical and acoustic product lines in the last answer. Our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, what you see is a tough comparison when compared to last year where this business grew significantly. And what you also find is that customers, particularly supply chain teams of medical device customers after very unique years of pandemic, supply chain, being very cautious about their inventory levels. So we do see weakness in the order entry in this segment. Long-term, we are excited about this business. This is a business with very strong growth drivers, aging population, as I talked about in my opening remarks, aging population increased health chronic conditions, increased procedure volumes, all of that fuels makes us confident about this. And we continue to have long-term project conversations with our customers and that is very active and healthy. We also have new product development work that we are continuing to work on and hear. And finally Atrion is an exciting add to this segment. And we expect that Atrion's products increases the addressable market for this segment nicely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Hammond : Hi. Good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Daniel Hopgood : Good morning. Jeffrey Hammond : So I want to start with this kind of medical interventional, I guess, it's normalization or destocking, it seems like that's kind of a newer dynamic. And I'm just wondering how long you think that persists before inventories are kind of or supply chains are back to normal? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. As we talked about, there are two things going on here a) in our biopharma business that has stabilized, that is starting to come back. In terms of our interventional business, last year, these businesses were up 15%, 16%. And so you have -- you're dealing with some tough comps. Certainly, supply chain is something that we find our customers to be a lot more cautious today than they were a year ago. Growth drivers remain the same. So it is kind of tough to call when this changes, but the procedure volumes are up, so there is nothing going on there. We see some in-sourcing, but look these projects and products when they are given to a company, there is regulations, there are approvals, FDA approvals and all of these things that are associated with winning a project, it is very difficult for -- these businesses tend to be a lot more sticky let's put it that way. And so if you think about this, it is tough to call this when this is going to turn. We have strong -- these are small set of customers. This is not a broad thousands of customers. These are a handful of medical device customers that we have strong relationships with and we are in touch with them. We understand where things are. So I'm trying to paint the picture for you of the overall environment, but not giving you an exact answer I recognize that. Jeffrey Hammond : No, that's okay. And then Atrion I just want to kind of unpack the deal impact. It seems like they did $169 million in '23. They were seeing high-single-digit growth. We only have kind of a stub quarter in the fourth quarter. But just what's kind of the next 12 months run rate of revenue we should think about? Where do we snap lines on EBITDA margins? How should we think about incremental interest, the amort add-back, D&A, et cetera? Just a little more color there. Sundaram Nagarajan : So let me get -- paint some broad pictures and then Dan can take you through a little bit more detail, right. Broadly, you want to think about this as a mid-single-digit company. That's what this business is. You also want to think in terms of EBITDA margin performances, it is below their historical performance, mainly because of supply chain issues and some operational issues that they have had. We fully expect and our model recognizes and the synergies we have signed up for are based on the fact that we resolved many of these and over two years, right. Over the period of time, we have said we would achieve these synergies over a period of two years. We see a good path to achieving these synergies using NBS Next. I want to say somewhere in '26, this business gets back to Nordson-like EBITDA margins, which is what this business historical performance was. So let me give, with that sort of high level, Dan, if you want to add a little bit more color to the question Jeff has. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. And I guess what I'd say is a) there's no surprise based on their second quarter results versus what we expected to see in the business. I think it's right in line with our modeling. I think I would say as far as specific guidance for next year, give us a quarter, we've owned the business for a day. We know what we know, which is largely public information that you have access to as well. But again, nothing that we've seen surprises us. And in fact, we're very comfortable with the model that we had for the acquisition. We'll give a little more color on that as we give color to next year, next quarter. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Appreciate it. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Michael Pesendorfer : Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is Pesen for Mike. I want to go back to the conservative order comment from the interventional side of the business. To be clear, is this incremental to the tough comps that we're expecting in the back half of this calendar year, is this simply a cost to carry inventory discussion? And then consequently, should we be expecting destocking in the near-term and a more normal cadence as customers kind of get to that new desired level of inventory. Is that how we should be thinking about that? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. What I would tell you is that is what we are experiencing right now. If you think about last year, this business grew in the teens. Typically, this business grows anywhere from 6% to 8%. So growing at mid-teens, that's pretty high, right? And so what we are experiencing today in the orders is really in some adjustment to that. If you look at procedure volumes, look at our project activity, look at our product development work, we fundamentally believe that the long-term thesis of growth in this business is intact. Certainly, it is difficult to time. We see a certain amount of -- we do see some amount of slowness, right. So I want to be clear about what we're talking about. It is tough comps, but it also, we see slowness. And when -- as you think about when do we get out of this, certainly, there are some amount of device manufacturers thinking about their inventory levels and adjusting them to reasonable levels. Could that be an impact from interest rates? It's difficult for me to guess any of that. But I would say we do see a conservative, cautious order pattern from our medical device customers. Michael Pesendorfer : Understood. That's helpful, Naga. And then maybe if we could stay on MFS a little bit. I think I may have missed it earlier on the call. Could you help me on the fluid components side? And then on EFD? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, EFD. Michael Pesendorfer : Could you help me out a little bit on the trends there? Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. EFD is doing well. Order entries are returning. We do see, I think we commented maybe a couple of quarters ago that this was one of those businesses where we're seeing early indicators of electronics customers starting to order more. This business is -- the order entry in this business is pretty encouraging and a lot of the work that they're doing in Asia-based electronic customers is pretty encouraging. Michael Pesendorfer : Understood. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Edward Magi : Good morning, guys. This is Ed on for Andrew. Thanks for taking my questions. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the mix of cash and debt to finance the deal, which puts you about 2 times to 2.5 times leverage closing 2024. With the strong free cash flow profile, leverage manageable, can you refresh us on how you're thinking about M&A? And more specifically, what remains in the pipeline? Thanks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Let me start first and then Dan will sort of take over for a couple of other comments around capital deployment. Look, our commitment to organic growth and having a balanced acquisition-led growth remains the same. There's no change there. Our strategic and financial criteria for acquisition remain the same. We feel strongly about how we have been able to be disciplined around the strategic criteria for what acquisitions we're adding to the portfolio and pretty disciplined around the financial rigor on what we need to do with a particular acquisition that will allow us to deliver the returns we target. So our pipeline remains this you know remains pretty healthy. And we are open to many different types of deals and you've seen that over the past year and we continue to work the pipeline. Let me have Dan talk to you a little bit about leverage and capital deployment. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. Maybe just to add a couple of points. Our stated target has been 2 times to 2.5 times leverage long-term. And obviously with just completing the acquisition for Atrion, we'll be at the higher end of that, but that will be temporary. And maybe the best example to give you is we saw a similar thing happened last year when we acquired ARAG. And then as of the end of this quarter, we're back down to 1.6 times leverage. So we've got, obviously, plenty of capacity. And with our cash flow profile, as you point out, we can quickly delever. And as Naga mentioned, we have an active pipeline. And when the right deal comes along, we'll be ready to move forward. Edward Magi : Great to hear. And then, Dan, back to you for this one. You've been CFO for about a quarter now. You come to a company which is at great progress and margin expansion. From your initial assessments, what areas are you seeing in the business as opportunities for further improvement from here? Daniel Hopgood : I appreciate the question. I guess I'll say this and Naga and I spend a lot of time on our best opportunity as a company is continuing to grow organically, which is our major focus, right? Our margins are very healthy. Our cash flow is very healthy. Squeezing margins is not the best use of our time. Our time is better spent figuring out how to continue to grow the company organically and inorganically. Edward Magi : Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walter Liptak from Seaport Research Partners. Your line is open. Walter Liptak : Hey. Good morning, guys. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning. Walter Liptak : Good quarter. Good morning. I want to ask kind of a follow-on to the IPS segment question and get some color around the stable sort of low-single-digit outlook for IPS. And I guess what I'm trying to get to is that we have seen other similar industrial companies kind of pauses in their industrial goods businesses, especially longer term kind of project businesses. So I wonder if you could provide just some more color around geographic regions, China, Europe versus North America. And you called out some growth areas, and I wonder how much of the focus from NBS Next helps you to gain market share in some of those growing markets as opposed to maybe some others that might be weaker. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Let's maybe give you some you know a little bit color into a couple of the divisions and where we're thinking. First and foremost, this is year four of NBS Next. Clearly, within our businesses, and IPS being one of those businesses, which where we first implemented and a couple of other MFS businesses to be implemented next. What you find here is, we operate in a diversified set of end market niches. And in some of these cases, particularly in IPS, what you find is certain end markets are have high demand or growing and having investments at a particular time. But over six quarters or 12 quarters, what you find is another end market application getting more demand and becoming more important for the growth of the business. So for each of our division leaders, understanding each of these end markets, end market niches and being agile and entrepreneurial in shifting resources from one end market to another to another is a great way for us to continue to participate in markets that are growing and the resource, for a period of time, markets that are not growing, right. So it is a dynamic set of end market niches that the teams are operating in. NBS Next allows them to be able to have clarity around those applications and be able to shift one to another. So that is, that certainly helps us, that allows us to have the steady performance, which you see on the outside. But within the company, within the divisions, you do see some markets doing well, others not doing so well. So that's one sort of dynamic that we've you know that's important to recognize. The second is, certainly, there are certain end markets like plastic processing, for example. We've had an incredible run for the last 2, maybe 2.5 years. And might you expect some modest pullback on those. Yes, there is a possibility. But overall, we are very pleased with how our teams are using NBS Next how -- because we constantly talk within the company the best opportunity for Nordson for our businesses is growth. And understanding your best customers, understanding your best market opportunities, deploying your differentiated products to those, that's the ticket to win. And so really these market conditions are dynamic and different, but I fundamentally believe our effective Ascend strategy with NBS Next and own a mindset, division-led structure that allows our teams to be entrepreneurial, certainly helps. The core strength of the company still remains the same, diversified end markets, systems and high-recurring revenues, close to the customer model, playing with differentiated products. All of these core strengths is what makes Nordson successful. I am incredibly proud of our team because at varying economic demand conditions, our team consistently over the last three years have delivered 30% plus EBITDA margins. And that is not same for everybody. In some cases, we've had to adjust costs. In some cases, we had to invest ahead of the curve. I think that kind of goes to speak to our Ascend strategy and NBS Next growth framework. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great. Yeah, no doubt, the margin improvement has been there and it's good to see you're getting some, you're able to shift around to these different markets. Okay. Yeah, I guess maybe just to see if we can get some geographic thoughts, how you're seeing some of the Asian markets or Europe. I wonder if we can get any comments there. Sundaram Nagarajan : If you think about different regions, still the US based markets have been the best and have been the strongest. If you near-term look at our businesses in Asia specific, particularly, they are benefiting from what we see in our electronics business. Our electronic businesses are coming back and so you see our Asia-Pac markets are recovering nicely. China is also doing well, but you also have some of our nonwoven customers, our OEM customers in China have been a source of strength for our businesses. So Europe is still in -- our organic growth there is a little weaker than our own -- but you have OEM customers there. Our parts revenues are pretty good, our system revenues a little bit. You also see in Europe is our ARAG impact is also -- because Europe ARAG is mostly a European business. Walter Liptak : Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open. Christopher Dankert : Hey. Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Sundaram Nagarajan : Morning. Christopher Dankert : I guess first, I guess, first off, if we could kind of look at backlog a little bit more. Can you just maybe give us some comments on how you see the complexion there, how the systems are kind of normalizing as a part of that mix? Would you agree there's still about $100 million or so left of kind of elevated backlog versus normal? Maybe just some commentary around how you see that piece of the business and then how that's progressing. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. If you think about our backlog, it's important to level set where the business was historically, right. Historically, it was around $400 million, $450 million. Of course, in this incredible period of time, the business has grown. So the scale at which we would expect a normalized or historically normalized backlog is different, right? But the other thing that has also changed is customer order patterns are different. In one example I would give you, in our medical businesses in the past, we used to get large blanket orders that go into our backlog. Well, that doesn't happen anymore. Our delivery performance has significantly improved. And so we certainly have customers starting to have an expectation that we can ship things much faster than we have ever in our history. So a couple of different dynamics. What we do see in our $640 million, $650 million backlog is, it is still weighted to our system businesses. But if you think about our regular businesses, which are book and ship type businesses, they've all returned to normal order entry, normal backlogs now for several quarters. So this is nothing new for us. We continue to, as our backlog comes down, it is really our system business backlog coming down. Christopher Dankert : Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you, Naga. And then maybe just quickly on ARAG, forgive me if I missed it. Again, obviously, a little bit more weakness in that end market from a sales perspective. But just curious how you are seeing the margin performance in that business, how is the team handling the lower volumes? Any color would be great. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah, the margin performance has been really good. The company is performing at Nordson-like EBITDA margin levels. And so we couldn't be more pleased with the team. I think we are focused on making sure we reinforce the things that we liked about the business and we like the technology. We like the market presence in Europe. We like the precision ag components that we are delivering to some of our largest customers. So it is really important, even in this downturn, staying focused on new product development, staying focused on customers that are going to generate the demand as the cycle comes back is where we are focused on. Most of the integration is pretty much done. We really like the team. The team is doing a wonderful. They're getting to know NBS Next. They're starting to have an enthusiasm on implementing it in their businesses. And we, as a company, are learning to operate in Italy, right. And it is a new geography for us, but we've been in Europe for a long time. We've been in Europe for decades in Germany and in UK. So this is adding a new country to our mix of businesses. So overall, integration going well, love the technology, great people. They are integrating well into the company, learning NBS Next, getting in our cadence of operations. So it's an exciting time. The market is not helping us. But I think that is temporary in my opinion. It will take time to come back. But we are prepared and we are focused on things that we need to be focused on and not letting distracted from a technology development perspective. Christopher Dankert : Understood. Thanks so much for the detail, Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Sure. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Naga for closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. The long-term profitable growth strategy that fuels our total shareholder value remains strong. We look forward to seeing you in person at our New York Investor Day on October 3rd, 2024. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

There will be a telephone replay of the conference call available until December 19, 2024. During this conference call, references to non-GAAP financial metrics will be made. A complete reconciliation of these metrics to the most comparable GAAP metric has been provided in the press release issued yesterday. Before we begin, please refer to slide two of our presentation where we note that certain statements regarding our future performance that are made during this call may be forward-looking based upon Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. Moving to today's agenda on slide three. Naga will discuss fourth quarter and full year highlights. He will then turn the call over to Dan to review sales and earnings per and the three business segments. Dan also will talk about the year-end balance sheet and cash flow. Naga will conclude with high-level commentary about our including an update on the Ascend strategy, as well as our fiscal 2025 full year and first quarter guidance. We will then be happy to take your questions. With that, I'll turn to slide four and hand the call over to Naga. Good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you for joining Nordson's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year conference call. In fiscal 2024, we continue to make progress on our Ascend strategy, delivering record sales of $2.7 billion and record EBITDA dollars of $849 million or 32% of sales. This is a testament to our employees who have, in the last four years, deployed and delivered results with NBSNext, our growth framework, despite dynamic global macro conditions, end market changes, supply chain disruptions, and more. The core elements of our business model have enabled us to deliver profitable growth throughout these challenges. This includes a steadfast focus on our customers, commitment to innovation, diversified geographic and end market exposures, and a high level of recurring revenue through aftermarket parts and consumables. Since launching the Ascent strategy in 2021, we've added new capabilities to our business model including the NDS Next growth framework and a division-led structure which have empowered our teams to respond rapidly to changing market conditions. I will speak more to the enterprise performance in a few moments. But I'll now turn the call over to Dan to provide more detailed perspective on our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year 2024. Daniel Hopgood : Thank you, Naga, and good morning to everyone. I'll start on slide five, which summarizes our overall results for the fourth quarter. You'll see fourth quarter 2024 sales were $744 million, up 4% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter sales of $719 million. The increase included 6% growth from acquisitions, primarily from the recent Atrium acquisition but also the final weeks of contribution from the AirAg acquisition we completed in the prior year. Currency translation was favorable by 1% and organic sales were down 3% compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. The organic sales decrease was driven by challenging year-over-year comparisons in our Industrial Precision Solutions segment and year-over-year declines in selected product categories within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment. These were partially offset by a return to growth in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment, and I'll cover a bit more on each of our segments in a moment. Adjusted operating profit, which excludes $26 million in non-recurring costs related to the Atrion acquisition and one-time restructuring costs during the quarter, was $205 million, up 30 basis points from the prior year on a percentage of sales basis. This was driven by gross margin improvements of about 110 basis points reflecting factory efficiency gains, and a higher mix of parts revenue. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased about 80 basis points year over year, reflecting the addition of Atrion, and continued investment in front-end growth initiatives. All in, this represents a 35% incremental operating margin for the company, which is on the high end of our targeted performance. EBITDA for the fourth quarter increased 6% over the prior year to a record $241 million or 32% of sales. This is 200 basis points above our long-term profitability target as articulated in our Ascend strategy. This also compares to $227 million also at 32% of sales in the prior year fourth quarter. That translates into a 56% incremental EBITDA on our 4% overall sales growth for the quarter. A really strong quarter of both operational execution and the initial integration of the Atrion acquisition. Sundaram Nagarajan : Looking at non-operating income and Daniel Hopgood : expenses in the quarter, interest expense in the quarter increased nominally to $27 million. This modest increase is driven by higher net debt levels due to acquisitions compared to the prior year. As a reminder, in September, we accessed the public debt markets raising $600 million in five-year notes at 4.5% in order to finance the Atrion acquisition. The balance of the purchase price was funded with our revolver, which we expect to pay down in the near term. Other expense on a net basis increased $5 million year over year primarily due to currency fluctuations and some reduction in pension income year over year. Tax expense was $26 million for the quarter, an effective tax rate of 17%. Our fourth quarter tax rate reflects changes in our mix of earnings due to acquisitions and other structural changes. It reflects a full-year effective tax rate of 20%. This improved mix is expected to continue going forward and you'll see this reflected in our 2025 guidance that Naga will cover a bit later. GAAP net income totaled $122 million or $2.12 per diluted share, while adjusted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring acquisition and restructuring-related expenses totaled $2.78 per share, a 3% increase over the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.19 above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter reflecting equal contributions from strong operating performance during the quarter and the favorable tax rate differential I just mentioned. Now let's turn to slides six through eight to review our fourth quarter segment performance. Industrial Precision Solutions sales of $392 million decreased 3% compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Organically, IPS decreased 5% in the quarter, with the AirAg acquisition adding 1% and currency providing a favorable impact of another 1%. You'll recall that IPS delivered record sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, driven by record sales in industrial coatings product line, and elevated deliveries in our polymer processing products. These create tough year-over-year comparisons for the segment, and are driving the overall organic decline in the IPS segment for the quarter. For the full year, IPS organic sales were flat with the prior year. EBITDA for the quarter was $143 million or 37% of sales reflecting consistent operational performance on slightly lower sales. Turning to Slide seven, Medical and Fluid Solutions sales of $200 million increased 19% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the Atrion acquisition and a minor currency benefit offset by a decrease in organic sales volume of 3% or $5 million. The organic volume decline reflects some softness in medical interventional solutions product lines, partially offset by modest improvement in our fluid components and fluid dispense product lines. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $72 million or 36% of sales, which is an increase of 17% compared to the prior year EBITDA of $62 million or 37% of sales. EBITDA margins were slightly lower than the prior year due to the inclusion of the acquired Atrion business. You'll recall that we expect Atrion EBITDA margins to improve over time as we continue to integrate the business and implement our MBS Next growth framework. Turning to slide eight, you'll see Advanced Technology Solutions sales of $152 million increased 5% compared to the prior year's fourth quarter. This change included an increase in organic sales volume of 4%, as well as a small currency benefit. Growth in the quarter was driven by improvement in selected test and inspection product lines, as well as modest improvement within our electronics dispense product lines. Our sales in ATS reflect continued sequential improvement from the third quarter and a return to nominal year-over-year growth in this segment for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We've seen electronics and semiconductor end markets continue to show signs of stable improvement. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $41 million or 27% of sales, an increase of $6 million from the prior year fourth quarter EBITDA of $35 million or 24% of sales. We're really pleased with the segment's EBITDA performance, particularly in a down cycle as the 27% EBITDA margin performance represents a significant step up from historical performance. It's a testament to the team's efforts to improve the structure of the base business. And it positions us well when the electronics markets return to more meaningful growth. Now turning to slide nine, I'll share a few comments on our full year results. 2024 full year sales were a record $2.7 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year's previous record sales result. This was driven by a 5% impact from acquisitions, offset by an organic decrease of 3%. On a full-year basis, the organic sales decrease is essentially all driven by our Advanced Technology Solutions segment, although we did see orders and sales continue to improve in our ATS product line as we exited 2024. The Industrial Precision Solutions Medical and Fluid Solutions segment were essentially flat organically on a combined basis with industrial up slightly and medical down slightly for the year. Adjusted operating profit was $713 million or 27% of sales, which was comparable to the prior year. EBITDA for the full year increased 4% to a record $849 million or 32% of sales. This represents a full-year incremental EBITDA margin of 49% and it marks the fourth consecutive year of the Ascend strategy delivering solid EBITDA growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $8.11 for the year, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $9 per share, a 1% decrease from the prior year, reflecting the higher interest costs associated with the AirAg and Atrion acquisitions. On balance, we're pleased with how we finished the year despite some near-term weakness in certain end markets. And we remain confident in our five-year targets established at our October 2024 Investor Day. Finally, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on Slide ten. We had another strong cash flow year generating $492 million in free cash flow at a conversion rate of 105% on net income. While still strong, cash flow conversion was down from 2023, and this was due to higher capital investments and additional use of working capital both of which we expect to normalize going forward. While our debt balance increased in the quarter due to the Atrion position, we continue to deploy cash efficiently. During the quarter, we increased our annual dividend by 15% marking our sixty-first year of consecutive annual increases. On a full-year basis, excluding the impact of the Atrion acquisition, we repaid approximately $315 million of debt, paid out $161 million in dividends, and repurchased $28 million of shares on the open market. Through our strategic capital deployment, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet, with cash balances of $116 million and net debt at $2.1 billion resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.5 times based on trailing twelve months EBITDA. This is within our targeted long-term range, and also in line with our expectations for the year. So in closing, just to summarize, our fourth quarter sales were in line with our previous guidance. And we came in better from an overall profit conversion standpoint. We're very pleased to see our Advanced Technology segment continue to show signs of positive improvement and demands. And our IPS and MFS segments continue to deliver strong operational performance despite some near-term demand weakness in selected product lines. We closed fiscal 2024 with a strong balance sheet, and we've steadily reinvested in the business. Positioning ourselves well for a dynamic 2025. I'll now turn the call back to Naga. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you, Dan. As I reflect on the past four years since we launched our Ascent strategy, we started from a position of strength with many competitive advantages. Leadership position in diversified niche end markets. High recurring parts revenues, a direct-to-customer model, and differentiated products built on deep knowledge of our customers' demanding applications. In the past four years, we have added two new advantages to expand our competitive mode. The first is a renewed emphasis on our growth bias portfolio that has positioned us to accelerate profitable growth. Over time, we have strategically increased our mix of recurring revenue, and we have expanded into the high-growth end markets of medical and electronics. This mix has been strategically driven through organic and acquisitive means. In the short term, end market cycles and unique macro conditions have slowed organic growth in these segments. This increases the importance of balancing organic growth with acquisitions. Our recent Atrium Medical acquisition is a great example of this strategy. This acquisition expands our fluid components addressable market by more than 50%, by adding products and solutions for infusion therapies and drug delivery. It also expands our current offering to top medical device customers and broadens Nordson's exposure to significant single-use consumables with recurring revenue streams. Atrium was a solid contributor to our fourth quarter revenue and it'll be a growth driver in fiscal 2025 and beyond. The second advantage that we have added to note is the NBS Next growth framework. It drives profitable growth and creates value in our acquisitions. I'm very pleased with the implementation of NBS Next which is becoming a competitive advantage. Throughout 2024, I traveled to many of Nordson sites including Europe, China, and India, in October and November. It is clear to me that the NBS Next growth framework is now how we run our businesses. You can see it evidenced in the fourth quarter results of our ATS segment. As Dan noted, ATS achieved 27% EBITDA margins while still in the downside of the electronic cycle, due to its strategic repositioning. They'll be very well positioned to respond to cut when the market turns. At our Investor Day in October, we shared several examples of how NBS Next has driven improved performance in on-time delivery and product quality, allowing the Nordson's divisions to protect and grow market share. I encourage you to listen to the Investor Day webcast recording which is available on our investor website. As we work towards our new financial performance targets, NBS Next and the Ascent strategy have ample runway to enable the Nordson team to be successful in the next five years. Operator : Also, at our Investor Day, Sundaram Nagarajan : we announced our 2025 to 2029 performance targets. In 2029, when we look back on our financial results, we expect to leverage the Ascent strategy to deliver average annual growth of 6% to 8% in revenue, balanced between organic and acquisition of growth and 10% to 12% in adjusted EPS growth. As this is an average annual growth target for that period, growth can be higher in some years and lower in others. We are entering 2025 prudently with conservative expectations for many of our end markets. We also recognize the level of change in the global macro environment, which could cause our customers to be judicious in their spending in the near term. In our Industrial Precision Solutions segment, although our current order entry trends are encouraging, we are expecting large capital investments to be muted in the near term, based on customer conversations, and reduced backlog levels. For our large system businesses, particularly polymer processing product lines, reduced investment in areas such as recycling, will be significant headwinds after two record sales years. Additionally, although European agriculture end market seems to have stabilized, we are cautiously awaiting meaningful growth. Within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, medical device customer supply chain teams are being far more cautious with their inventory purchase patterns. We currently see this impact in weakness within our interventional solutions product line, which is approximately 47% of this segment's sales. Long-term project pipelines remain solid and we continue to stay close to our customers and ensure we understand their post-COVID supply chain product needs. Modest growth from our fluid components and fluid dispense product lines will somewhat offset this pressure. But we expect MFS growth to largely come from the Atrion acquisition in fiscal 2025. Positively, we expect to see continued steady improvement in sales from our electronics customers. That said, we do not expect that a significant ramp in capital spending is imminent as customer purchasing patterns have been wary compared to prior electronic cycles, particularly in semiconductor applications. We remain close to our customers particularly the geopolitical issues in play. Now turning to the financial outlook. On slide fourteen, we enter fiscal 2025 with approximately $580 million in backlog. The sequential backlog reduction is reflective of a pace return to more normalized levels. Based on the combination of order entry, backlog, current foreign exchange rates, and anticipated end market expectations we anticipate delivering sales in the range of 2% to 7% above fiscal 2024 sales. Full year 2025 adjusted earnings are forecasted to be in the range of neutral to 8% growth per diluted share. For modeling purposes, in fiscal 2025, assume an estimated effective tax rate of 19% to 21%, capital expenditures of approximately $50 to $60 million, and interest expense of up approximately $90 to $100 million. This full-year guidance assumes a negative 1.5% impact from foreign exchange rates, no significant recovery in ramp in electronics or agricultural end markets, and the Atrion acquisition contributing approximately 6% growth at the midpoint of guidance. If we see improvements in our end markets, we will adjust. Based on seasonality, we expect our fiscal first quarter to start modestly. Daniel Hopgood : As you will see on slide fifteen, Sundaram Nagarajan : first quarter fiscal 2025 sales are forecasted in the range of $615 to $655 million and adjusted earnings in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 per diluted share. Even in uncertain times, our team delivers operational excellence, and strong cash flow due to our strong competitive advantages. As a growth compounder, we will continue to reinvest in the business while returning cash to our shareholders. Again, Daniel Hopgood : I want to thank our employees, Sundaram Nagarajan : customers, and shareholders for your continued support. We will now open the phone lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to withdraw your questions, simply press star one again. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is open. Mike Halloran : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Daniel Hopgood : Morning. Sundaram Nagarajan : Alright. Appreciate all the thoughts at the end there on the outlook and the conservatism in the first quarter and some of the variable order patterns. But you know, maybe you could frame up how you're thinking about growth as it works through the year. It doesn't sound like you're embedding any fundamental improvement. Is the guidance assuming relatively normal seasonality? And maybe just give some thoughts on what your customers are saying or how you see these end markets cadencing as we work through the year. Sundaram Nagarajan : Mike, thank you for the question. We'll do it this way. Let me first give you what we're seeing in the end markets. And then Dan can walk you through the guidance and how we're thinking, you know, how we've built the outlook. Right? So let's start with the IPS. You know? In IPS, what I would tell you is our consumer non-durable end markets seem to have a steady outlook. And, you know, there are parts that are really good, then there are parts that are steady. Further, recurring revenue in this business is fairly high as you know. And this has grown last year. We expect it to contribute nicely in the year. On the headwinds, what I would share with you is that we are expecting large capital investments to be muted in the near term. You know, based on customer conversations and reduced backlog. Particularly, in the polymer processing product line, we have seen reduced investments, you know, after record two sales record years of two years of sales. And reduce investment in recycling and also some push start investments in virgin polymer in Asia. They're also seeing slowness in automotive. With our ICS business. Our agricultural precision ag business in Europe, things have stabilized, and we're cautiously awaiting the return there. So that's the puts and takes in IPS. If you look at MFS, you know, we do see modest growth in our fluid components business, which is sort of, you know, there is some exposure in biopharma. We're seeing order entry, modest slip up there. Fluid dispense business is also doing fairly steady. So these two businesses will offset the pressure we are seeing in our medical interventional business. In our medical interventional product category, what we are finding out is that the OEM supply chain teams are far more conservative and cautious about their inventory purchases. And hence, we're seeing weakness in this product line. And remind you, this is about 47% of the segment's revenues. Long-term project pipelines look pretty strong for this product category. Addition, Atrium, you know, addressable market increase for our businesses has a very positive development. And the growth in this segment would primarily come from Atrium acquisition. The APS business segment, what you find there is steady improvement and positive order entry to the kind of growth rates you saw in the fourth quarter. We don't our assumptions are there is not a significant ramp in capital spending. Mainly, we see the order patterns in this recovery far more choppier than we have seen in the past. We remain close to our customers. There is a number of geopolitical issues that are at play here and that impacts this business. So that gives you sort of a broad overview of what we are experiencing in the end markets. And maybe let me have Dan walk you through how that plays into our outlook. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. Thanks, Naga. And the only thing that I might add just on the market overview is just and maybe this is more of a reminder. You know, on our ag business, while we've seen certainly our book and bill and order rates stabilized, we still have one quarter of tough comparables in Q1 in that business, as you recall, Q1 of last year, we were working off a large backlog in our ag business. So we've seen the underlying business is, like I said, is in a very good stable place but we've got one more tough comparable in Q1 in the ag business due to the backlog work off last year. So that said, Mike, just to give you some color, you know, if you think of the overall market outlook and basically think of, you know, flat organic growth for the year. What I would tell you is the sales profile, if you look at our Q1 guidance in the full year, it's pretty much right in line with the seasonality that we would typically see in the business. You know, Q1 is always our lowest quarter. Typically around 23% of our annual sales. If you look at history, excluding acquisitions. And so I think you'll see that play out in our guidance. The only anomaly that we see this year, and it's not a big contributing factor, but it is a factor, is the timing of Chinese New Year actually hits our first quarter this year whereas it's hit our second quarter the last couple of years. So if anything, that just means Q1 will be slightly weaker than normal because we lose that production in Q1. That would typically hit us in Q2. But other than that, it's pretty much right in line with our seasonality that we've seen historically. Mike Halloran : Okay. That was really helpful. Thanks for that follow-up. On the Electra side in the fourth quarter, was there anything unusual? I mean, was there just kind of a flush that happened? Because I know we've had some delays that have materialized. Was there just, you know, an element of finally getting some of those projects pushed through? Would you consider that the right run rate? And then related, what are you seeing that gives you confidence that there's some modest improvement coming on the electronic side? I know the capital piece you're cautious on, but any kind of more subtext on where that improvement's coming from on the electronic side even if it is modest. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. You know, Sundaram Nagarajan : look, there are a couple of things that I would point to. First and foremost, we certainly are seeing strong continued conversations with our customers around projects and things that are coming our way. So that's number one. Second, what we are beginning to see is those conversations beginning to translate into order entry, and that order entry is allowing us to deliver the kind of growth we did in the fourth quarter, probably the first time in a long, long time. We are seeing parts revenue in that business also be pretty steady for us. You know, the caution and conservatism is that we're not seeing significant capital spend. And so, essentially, we are trying to be conservative here in trying to call this as the significant uptick. But the positive order trends in the business give us confidence that this would be a pretty, you know, modest growth period for ATS in 2025. Mike Halloran : And then just the fourth quarter piece, anything in the fourth order that you felt was an anomaly or is that relatively normal? Sundaram Nagarajan : Pretty normal. You know? Pretty normal. Mike Halloran : Yeah. Yeah. And I appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ben: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of small items. You cited the backlog including Atrion at $580 million but could you just help us understand the backlog excluding this acquisition? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think it's Danny, you wanna take that, please? Daniel Hopgood : Yep. It's Atrion added about $35 million to the backlog. So you know, we'd be in the $550 range excluding. Ben: Okay. Sundaram Nagarajan : Ben, if I would add one more thing to your backlog question, I know you didn't ask this, but what I would give you some color around the backlog is remember, the company's recurring revenue continues to expand. Today, it is, you know, north of 55%, more like 57%. And a significant portion of that is book and ship. Daniel Hopgood : So you gotta Sundaram Nagarajan : you know, put that into context while you're thinking about the backlog production as well. Ben: Appreciate that. You mentioned the impact of the Chinese New Year on Q1. I believe you've had historically put this at a $15 million to $20 million sales impact. So would that be similar this year, and does this just get pushed to the second quarter? Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. I think typically, Ben, in the call it, in the $10 to $20 range. I think, yeah, that's still appropriate. And, yeah, it's just timing between Q1 and Q2. Ben: Thanks. And just lastly for me, you know, you've talked a lot about entering this year with conservative estimates. You know, what would get you to the higher end of your full-year guidance? Or maybe how do you think about potential upside to guidance in a more positive scenario? Daniel Hopgood : You want me to take that now? I can. Yeah. That's a great question. And yeah. Look. I think if from the very hopefully, you get some color with you know, we're not trying to call recoveries. Key markets. And what I look at the upper end of our guidance, it would anticipate stronger recovery in some of these end markets. As you think of Precision Ag, as you think of our ATS and Technology businesses, and so I think that's if I were to look at the upper end, it would be, you know, a stronger recovery in the semiconductor and electronics markets. It would be some strong recovery in some of the general industrial and other markets, you know, versus kind of the status quo that we're seeing right now. Ben: Appreciate that. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Line is open. Christopher Glynn : Yeah. Thanks. No. I think early in the call, you talked about factory efficiency gains. And did you say you have inflecting efficiency gains? Just looking for a little more color on you're calling that out early in the call today. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. You know, look, this is as we continue to deploy MBS Next and begin to see the impact of NBS Next in our businesses, you're also beginning to see product mix being helpful where when you have higher volume products, we are certainly making them a lot more efficiently than before. So it's a combination, a couple of different things. It is the choice of products, but it is also efficiency of making them in a better way. On-time delivery has significantly improved in all of our businesses. Know, that certainly helps us with efficiency. So a number of different factors, but pretty pleased with the progress we are making. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks. And with Atrium, it looks like the revenue trends are solid and growing if we prorate to a full quarter. Are EBITDA margins back in that high 20s range and then curious what the DNA is now that you've owned it and probably the accounting settled out. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Let me maybe give you just some broad color and then Dan can sort of take some of the more financial questions. We're very pleased. We're very pleased with the integration. We're excited for our Atrium employees who have joined and are a big part of our story in the coming year. You know, integration going well. Revenue is progressing as we expected. We are making progress around the synergies that we had operating synergies that we had included in our model. All of that is coming out the way we think. Maybe let, Dan, if you can provide some of those data points that Chris is looking for, that'd be great. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. And if you think of, number one, appreciate the question and, yeah, the acquisition is off to a really good start in performing certainly in line or even slightly ahead of early expectations. Right? It's early. But from an EBITDA standpoint, yes, they are absolutely, you know, we're very comfortable in that upper 20% range right now, and we also still feel very comfortable with our path towards more Nordson-like margins. And the two-year integration period. From a DNA standpoint, it's they're DNA is a little bit higher than ours, particularly when you factor in acquisition accounting. And so they'd be a little bit north of us from a percent standpoint on DNA, but not materially. And then, yeah, EBITDA on the upper any core course pretty comfortable, and I'd say two months three three months in now. Even more comfortable with our path towards, you know, sustained margin improvement going forward. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thank you for that color. If I could get a quick one on ATS, the implementation of MBS Next growth framework helps mix leverage. We just talked about that. I'm curious if the revenue run rate today, which was very healthy in the quarter, includes anything you've kinda treated or you know, minimized in the holistic NBS Next process. Sundaram Nagarajan : So let me take a couple of things that the team has done an incredible job of strategically repositioning this business. During the downturn. And that is why you see the margin even at the beginning of a cycle. You can begin to see a 27% EBITDA. So well positioned that way. A couple of additional points that I would make that our growth framework, this has allowed the team now to reposition the business. We have a new manufacturing, and this distribution location in India that the team has been working on. That has positioned us really well to address the needs of some of our customers who are trying to have a China plus one manufacturing strategy. So we are well positioned there. The growth from that location will begin to impact in 2025. The second thing that I would tell you, the team has also used this time period to really invest in new products and innovation that will position us in the growth sides of the applications that our customers have, and we are pretty excited about a couple of new products. One or two of them have won some very good industry recognition. And so you know, a number of our strategy beginning to make an impact and our team strategically using this time to really position us for growth. Christopher Glynn : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Summerville from DA Davidson. Line is open. Matt Summerville : Yeah. Thanks. Can you maybe talk about the monthly order cadence you experienced in fiscal first quarter? What you're seeing thus far in fiscal Q1 and any discernible trends you'd call out pre or post the election with respect to order patterns, and then I have a follow-up. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. Again, I would say if you look at our guidance it's largely reflective of what we're seeing in the near term. You know, on the ATS side, you know, the four we said we had 4% organic growth in Q4, and I think our order patterns would tell us that that looks pretty sustainable. Yeah. We're not seeing a big uptick from there, but certainly we're seeing ongoing support for that, you know, return to nominal growth. Similar story in our other segments, I would say. Our order patterns support, you know, the guidance that we've given, and I think the one difference year over year that we're coming into now is, you know, we have kind of worked back to a normalized backlog. So yeah. That's certainly a factor year over year. I would say this, you know, we haven't seen any discernible shift post-election. I think it's a bit early. I think, you know, frankly, some of our customers are trying to wait and see a little bit see how things are gonna play out here. And, frankly, I think that some of the uncertainty that we're seeing in our near-term outlook I think that'll settle down certainly as things play out, but I think it's still pretty early innings and people are still trying to figure out yeah. What decisions they should make and what the implications are gonna be, I think. Now I don't know if you wanna add anything further, but that's kinda what we're hearing. Sundaram Nagarajan : So what I would add is, you know, it's certainly an uncertain macro environment. You know? You see the same things we do. And I think that uncertain market environment is really playing into our conservative approach to what we're taking to the outlook. Look. This could be it could be significantly better, or it could be more challenging than we expect. But in general, we feel like we have taken the appropriate steps to be conservative based on what we see today and based on what we know today. But I'll just remind you a couple of things. You know, the company has a very strong operating model. You know, we have a direct-to-customer model. We have differentiated products. High recurring revenue. Diversified end markets. And MBS Next as a growth framework is beginning to be how we run the company. So if you combine those trends and if you look at the operating excellence, the track record this team has had, you know, if you take all of 2024, and if you look at the EBITDA margin conversion, the incremental margins, that's well north of where we had guided in our investor day. So you know, so if you combine our competitive strengths you combine our ability to operate under any different sets of conditions, you know, gives us confidence that, you know, the environment would be the environment. But Nordson will figure out a way to operate it and do fairly well. And, you know, deliver cash and deliver, you know, strong EBITDA margins. Matt Summerville : Thanks. Just as a follow-up, based on Dan's commentary, it sounds like you at least expect modest organic growth in ATS in fiscal 2025, if I understood him correctly. Can you maybe just flush out then what your kind of baseline expectation is for organic at the segment level for IPS and MFS? Thank you. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. We typically don't I appreciate the question. Yeah. I think we typically don't give specific guidance on each of the segments. Know, but I would say if you look at Q4, yeah, it's maybe a good precursor for what you'd expect going forward. Right? Our IPS business is pretty stable. And even in the medical, you know, we've got some pluses and minuses. But, you know, generally, you know, they're kinda holding serve, I'll call it. And given some of the uncertainty in the minimally invasive space. And so yeah. If you look at it overall, maybe that's the best way to answer your question. If you peel back our guidance, it is it's essentially zero growth organically year over year. With the growth coming from the Atrion acquisition and then a slight offset from FX based on current FX ranges and you know, if you factor in let's call it, you know, low single-digit growth or ongoing growth in ATS, you know, that kinda tells you what the answer is for the other segments. Matt Summerville : Got it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Hammond : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Daniel Hopgood : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : So just on backlog, I know backlog, you know, got elevated during COVID, and people kinda, you know, stretched out or, you know, made more orders and, you know, given the lead time issues. But just wondering, you know, if you think this backlog normalization is largely done and what businesses, you know, would have seen the most kinda backlog normalization, you know, over the last year that would maybe set up a little bit of a tough comp? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Let me start and then, you know, Dan can add additional. Mostly, it is our system businesses. Large system businesses. I think, you know, even a couple of quarters ago when we continue to talk about this, we continue to see a reduction in backlog from plastic processing. It's one of the large system businesses. And industrial coatings is the other business. And, you know, to some extent, we have large system orders in, you know, one part of our adhesive business. So those would be where we have typically seen order normalization. And it has been ongoing for a year, and you rightly point out. Jeff Hammond : Okay. And then on polymer processing, is that, you know, is that just a tough comp dynamic? Is that a Europe issue? I think there was a, you know, some recycling activity or something else that's, you know, that's hitting that. Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. A couple of things there. You know, certainly tough comps. Right. Two record years of sales. But you also have reduction in investments in recycling in Europe as well as reduction in investment in virgin polymer production in Asia, particularly China. So this business has been a huge contributor to our growth in the last couple of years. And now, you know, you have the cycle impacting them and, you know, they're gonna be down this year. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. I think the other thing just to reiterate backlog normalization, you know, our percentage of, you know, call it book and bill business continues to increase with our, you know, parts versus systems mix. Some of that's acquisition. Some of that's also, you know, what we've been doing organically. And so, you know, we're approaching 60% overall. I think we're at 57% or right around there plus that as far as, you know, parts and services. So that as you're looking historically at the backlog, where I think that's an important thing to consider as well. Jeff Hammond : Yeah. And then interventional destock, what are your customers telling you in terms of where inventories are, you know, what's kinda built into the guide, you know, for when that kinda, you know, runs its course? Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. So as I were to put it, like, I would say, you know, it feels like we're kind of middle somewhere in the middle innings as far as working through these supply chain changes. In the interventional businesses, there are product lines in particular. And so, you know, we have some return to normalization but we think that still has a little way to go to play out. And that's kinda how we're thinking about the year. Yeah. This works its way out in another quarter. Or two, and then we kinda get back to normal from there. The only other thing I would point out on that is, yeah, while we I know. But we've mentioned this in a couple of different conversations, we remain very comfortable with the long-term outlook and the prospects for growth in that business. And our pipeline is really what supports that. We still see plenty of project activity, line of sight, to returning to normal growth in our interventional solutions business. We've already seen some of our component medical components, and other areas return to normal growth. So we're very comfortable with the long-term prospects. It's really just trying to pick the exact timing of how this plays out is, I think, what we're continuing to work through with our customers. You know, one thing I would add to that is in our interventional business, Sundaram Nagarajan : this is an area, again, using NBS Next, our growth framework portfolio approach to how we think about growth. Over the past twelve to eighteen months, we have been investing in additional capacity in new areas of growth where, you know, there were modest positions for us prior to COVID. Post-COVID, and in the last twelve to eighteen months, it's a new product category that we are investing in. And, you know, that will help us as we come out of this stocking situation. Jeff Hammond : Alright. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia from BNP. Line is open. Andrew Buscaglia : Good morning, everyone. Sundaram Nagarajan : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Buscaglia : Hey. So just back to the full-year outlook, so you're assuming, you know, no let's call it no or very low organic growth at the midpoint, but EPS at the midpoint is still up. And I guess my confusion is MFS probably margins are flatter down just given you have some dilution with the acquisition. ATS probably up because of if it grows, then you got a cost taking cost out. So you have to assume some decent margin expansion, IPS, despite what you're what's implied to be probably a down or a flatter down, probably down organic growth year. So how I guess, are you is there additional cost cutting coming, or what how are you getting to such margin expansion, I guess, to get to the midpoint of that EPS? Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. No. It's a great question. And here's what I would tell you. I mean, if you look at our sales guidance and kinda take a normal incremental, I would say, keep in mind that part of our MBS Next is continuing to run the company better and we've also made some taken some actions in the form of restructuring to improve the cost base of the business going forward. And so, you know, you're gonna get some additional performance from an incremental standpoint year over year from those actions. In addition, you know, keep in mind, we're starting the year with our debt at a high point. And as we delever throughout the year, which we've typically continued to do, that will also create leverage as the year plays out. And then you factor in the last item, which is a year-over-year improvement in our tax rate as we mentioned in the call. I think those three factors are kinda what drives that conversion. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. And then Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. MSS too. You know, just maybe touching on that. The margins there, it seems like things are going well as of now, but yeah. We probably do see margins decline or do we see that, I don't know, these costs, you know, the cost savings and that side of things taking hold this year or mid-year to get to some margin expansion in the back half. Andrew Buscaglia : You talking specific to the MFS business? Daniel Hopgood : To the MFS? Yeah. Just MFS. Andrew Buscaglia : Okay. Okay. And really I think you're asking about Atrium, I assume. Right? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. Because it'll be it seems to be Daniel Hopgood : diluted, but not maybe not as much as we initially thought. Yeah. It's not you know, as I said, I think they're, you know, I think in a good path in the upper 20% range on EBITDA below our current, but to your point, not significantly diluted. And, you know, our model factored in improvements in the first one to two years. And I think we're, you know, largely on track with that. Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah. Okay. Sundaram Nagarajan : You know, Andrew, what I would add is integration going well. We made adjustments in cost structures early and but Dan what Dan is indicating to you for you is that our model calls for us over the next year to two is when we, you know, completely opt, you know, deliver on the synergies that we committed to. But we're off to a very good start. And margins in, you know, MFS are called in pretty nicely. Andrew Buscaglia : Yeah. Okay. Alright. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Walt Liptak from Seaport. Your line is open. Walt Liptak : Hi. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Daniel Hopgood : Morning, Walt. Walt Liptak : Good morning. I'm gonna try one about, you know, kind of orders and, you know, that comment that you made about, you know, not calling recoveries in the high end, you know, with some recovery. So, you know, what we've seen from some other industrial companies that have exposure to, you know, kind of medical and semi-con, is that they get, you know, sort of blanket orders or early orders in the year. Like, at what point will we know that, you know, that there's not the recovery happening? Do you find it in the December quarter, the quarter that we're in, or is it in the first quarter? And how important do you think, you know, for those larger systems are, you know, sort of early year orders that you, you know, deliver later on in the year. Daniel Hopgood : Yeah. I think maybe I'll take this. It's great. Again, maybe what I'll start with is what we're seeing now supports our current outlook. And I think the answer to your question is as Q1 and Q2 play out, I think we'll have, you know, a much better viewpoint on how the second half is gonna play out. Yeah. It's interesting. There are a lot of discussions that are going on, but there's also a lot of hesitance. And so that's generally, you know, kind of back to the earlier comments. I think that's what we're generally seeing is just some uncertainty and a lot of plans, but those plans, you know, today are translated into, I'll say, guarded investments. And that's kinda what we're seeing in the near term. And I think as Q1 and Q2 play out, we'll have a much better viewpoint. And, you know, what this, like, looks like for the year. Walt Liptak : Okay. Great. And Sundaram Nagarajan : hey. So, Walt, before he asks to follow on, let me just add one thing. Look. This is based on what we know today. And should something change, like you're, you know, suggesting might be or asking, you know, we will adjust. And particularly in the IPS area where large system orders are, you know, is one of the areas of concern. Walt Liptak : But ATS, though, Sundaram Nagarajan : the current order entry, the momentum that we see there, you know, clearly supports the kind of growth rate that we delivered in the fourth quarter. So Walt Liptak : okay. Great. Daniel Hopgood : Okay. So the next question would be as we're talking about the hesitancy, you know, the interest rates, you know, have been coming down. Right? The election is over. And then are we talking about sort of the tariff issue and that's causing the uncertainty in the headwind? Is that is that where those comments are coming from, or is it something else? Sundaram Nagarajan : Well, you know, look, nobody, obviously, is telling us or describing why they're hesitant. All we are, you know, what we can presume, you know, certainly that may have some impact in their thinking. But, you know, Walt, it will be difficult for us to tell you exactly why some of our customers have it. And all we can say is they're talking about projects, but there is a certain amount of hesitancy. You know, there is going to be change in EV battery investments. There's gonna be change in maybe solar. Who knows? Right? I mean, there's lots the macro environment is different, and certainly leads to some level of uncertainty. And that manifests itself as hesitancy in our customers. You know, the geopolitical environment is not all that great. It's not a stable environment to be in right now. So Walt Liptak : Yes. Absolutely. So then maybe a last one for me is, you know, thanks for pointing out the ATS EBITDA margins being really nice on sort of the bottom-ish part of the cycle. Where do you think you can get the, you know, like, in a normalized market, you know, a couple two, three years from now, where do you think ATS margins go? Or maybe another way to look at it, where do you think the operating leverage will be as, you know, the revenue improves? Sundaram Nagarajan : Yeah. I think it's really important to remember, our ATS business at 27% EBITDA is probably a best in class among our peers. Right? And it is an area where it requires a lot more investment in new products and technologies than any of our other businesses. We typically invest 14% to 15% of revenues in this area, and you have to stay ahead of the competition. But more importantly, to be able to fully support your customers' needs about investing in technology as they bring out new. So, you know, 27% EBITDA is a great place for us to be. We're looking to grow here. So any opportunity we can get to grow, we want to continue to grow this business rather than expand margin. If you look at the total company, well, you've seen this story for us. You know, we were in the 27%, 26% EBITDA margin, 31%, 32% ZIP code. Look. You know, you're gonna be a lot more happier as we continue to grow the top line of the company at strong incrementals rather than, you know, focused on EBITDA margins. And I'd take the same comment for the company and apply it to ATS. Right? Really like 27%. We want to continue to grow the business. Walt Liptak : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Naga for some final closing remarks. Sundaram Nagarajan : Thank you for your time and attention on today's call. We're making great progress on the Ascend strategy. Yeah. Positioned really well. As we enter fiscal 2025, I wish you a happy holiday season. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
