Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division Rachel Nabatian Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hormel Foods Corporation First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded today, February 20, 2014. And I will now turn the conference over to Jana Haynes, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jana Haynes : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter. Then, Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter. The line will be open for questions following Jody's remarks. [Operator Instructions] An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10 :30 a.m. Central Time today, February 20, 2014. The dial-in number is 1 (800) 406-7325 and the access code is 4664913. It will also be posted to our website and archived for 1 year. Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to Pages 26 through 30 in the company's annual report for the fiscal year ended October 27, 2013, for more details. It can be accessed on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We announced record first quarter earnings this morning of $0.57 per share, up 19% over last year. Operating profit increased by 20% with 4 of our 5 segments registering gains this quarter. In terms of the top line, we generated record sales of $2.2 billion, an increase of 6% over last year on volume growth of 2%. I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment profit increased 13%, and sales grew by 20%. Sales for Grocery Products in the quarter were down 2% excluding Skippy products. Sales gains in Grocery Products were led by Skippy peanut butter, Hormel chili, Hormel bacon toppings and the HERDEZ line of salsas and sauces. We are particularly pleased with our team's success in securing increased distribution and feature activity for our Skippy peanut butter products. While our Grocery Products segment profit increased during the quarter, there were some challenges. Higher beef and pork input costs pressured the margins of some of our core products, and sales of our SPAM family of products and Hormel Compleats microwave meals were soft during Q1. Segment operating profit for Refrigerated Foods was up 59%, driven by positive pork operating margins and growth in both our foodservice and retail value-added franchises. Sales for Refrigerated Foods increased 6% led by retail sales of our Hormel BLACK LABEL bacon, LLOYD'S Ribs and Hormel REV Snack Wraps. We also enjoyed sales growth in our foodservice business, including such items as our Hormel FIRE BRAISED Meats and Old Smokehouse Pecanwood Smoked Bacon. Segment volume for Refrigerated Foods declined 1% due to increased internal utilization of raw materials and the impact of our exit from the animal feed business in the second quarter of 2013. Segment profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store increased 1%. While we benefited from more favorable feed cost this quarter, the savings were offset by weaker live production performance due to the sustained extremely cold temperatures we have experienced this winter. The unusually cold weather has also caused national propane and natural gas shortages driving up the cost of these fuels significantly, which will negatively impact our raw material costs in the second and third quarters. Sales of our Jennie-O turkey Store lean ground turkey chubs and tray packs were strong in the first quarter as we kicked off a new Make The Switch media campaign in January, featuring lean ground turkey as an ingredient in tacos. Overall, the Jennie-O turkey Store segment reported sales growth of 2% on flat volume. Timing differences of whole bird shipments for the holiday season year-over-year masked some of the value-added sales increases we enjoyed during the quarter. We are pleased with the sustained growth of our value-added turkey products in retail, foodservice and deli as consumers continue to find better food solutions in our portfolio of turkey products. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 11% and a sales decrease of 16% driven by the expiration of the agreement last summer, allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes in the foodservice trade channels. The decline from the contract expiration more than offset gains in our sugar and Hormel health labs businesses. Our Specialty Foods team is focused on rebuilding its product portfolio and providing sales and operating profit growth as soon as possible. Our International & Other segment profit increased 32%, and sales grew 24%. Strong export sales of the SPAM family of products and Skippy peanut butter drove the positive results. Our China operations also continue to augment segment sales growth. As we move into the second quarter, we will kick off national media campaigns and promotional activity to support our SPAM family of products and Compleats microwave meals. We also expect continued positive momentum when it comes to our Skippy brand. Pork operating margins continue to be favorable. Bacon demand remains strong, and we are very pleased with the performance of our Hormel REV Snack Wraps, which are exceeding our expectations with excellent repeat purchase rates. The PED virus has impacted our internal farm operations and several of our independent hog suppliers. Our Refrigerated Foods team is closely monitoring the effects on our pork raw material supplies. Based on the timing of the virus breaks in our supply chain so far, we anticipate tighter pork raw materials in the summer months. We are taking steps now to ensure we will be able to meet the needs of our customers during this time period. We continue to expect year-over-year sales and profit growth from Jennie-O Turkey Store, but profit growth will be at more modest levels than initially anticipated due to fuel costs. Finally, we are enjoying significant growth in our International & Other business segment and look for this to continue going forward. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 earnings guidance of $2.17 to $2.27 per share. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter. Jody H. Feragen: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 totaled $153.3 million or $0.57 per share compared to $129.7 million or $0.48 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the first quarter totaled $2.24 billion compared to $2.12 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.27 billion pounds, up 2% from the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.4% of sales, unchanged from last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be between 7.3% and 7.6% of sales for the full year. Equity and earnings of affiliates was $4.7 million in the first quarter versus $9.8 million last year. The decrease is the result of unfavorable exchange rates and lower earnings at our MegaMex foods joint venture, which experienced higher input costs. Advertising expense for the quarter was $36.1 million compared to $24.7 million last year. The increase was the result of the new Make The Switch ad campaign for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the national advertising campaign for Hormel REV wrap. Additionally, advertising campaigns are planned for Skippy peanut butter, our SPAM family of products and Hormel Compleats microwave meals. Interest and investment income was $1.2 million for the first quarter compared to $1.8 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. We expect interest expense to be about $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.3% versus 33.5% in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.8 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.2 million shares. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.8 million, up from $29.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million to $128 million in fiscal 2014. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter total $37 million compared to $22.1 million last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million to $140 million. At the beginning of the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Skippy peanut butter business in China, spending $41.4 million and using our available cash balances for the transaction. The integration of this business into our current sales and distribution operation has been completed by our international team. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Luke? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today will come from the line of Jeremy Scott of CLSA. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Can you give us an update on the REV product line? How are consumers responding? And how is it performing versus your expectations? And then maybe an update on the Compleats breakfast line as well. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Very good. We're very pleased with how REV is performing in the marketplace. As we exited the holiday season and got into kind of back-to-school time frame for the winter semester at schools, we're seeing good sales response. We're ahead of schedule in terms of our repeat measures on this product line. We continue to have excellent distribution in the marketplace and would expect that our relaunch consumer advertising campaign will also add to sales within the REV line. When it comes to breakfast Compleats, we've had reasonably good success getting the product landed at a number of retailers. It's becoming one of the better selling items of the Compleats line, a few of the varieties, and so we're pleased in that regard. Overall, I have to concede the Compleats didn't fully live up to our expectations for the quarter, but we do between the advertising that's kicking in for Compleats and some better feature activities that we know we have on the books for the upcoming 2 quarters, we expect some improvements on the Compleats line and breakfast Compleats will be part of that. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Great. And I appreciate it's pretty difficult to track, but on PED, can you talk about your exposure relative to the industry? It seems like a lot of the barns affected are from your primary sourcing areas. And then maybe get into how -- what's the volume impact for the summer months and how the margin volatility is going to play into your guidance. Jody H. Feragen: Wow, that's a lot of questions in one question. Certainly, the industry condition leaves supplies uncertain for, I think, a lot of folks in the industry, and we would expect higher hog prices to result from that. And that's pretty much reflected in what we're seeing in the futures market. Our team has worked hard to identify gaps that we see in our supply chain, along with our internal supply, as well as our producers. And we will look to make sure that we try to secure enough production to make sure that we can meet our customers' needs and the needs of our value-added businesses. Did that answer all your questions? I'm trying to remember what the rest of them were. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Just what the -- what your expectations for a volume impact may be in the summer months when the shortages really come to -- into play. Jody H. Feragen: Boy, I don't really have a specific decline number for us because, as I'd indicated, we've been working to fill some of those gaps, so might be even a little early to tell. The benefit is, is that it's moving across the country, if you will, in waves so that it's not all going to absolutely hit one particular period. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc. Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : First question is on Jennie-O Turkey, can you -- you mentioned the fuel cost and just the tough -- the cold weather and the impact that's having on the operating profit. Can you help us quantify that in anyway? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I guess, the best I can tell you, Akshay, would be that our original expectations for Jennie-O Turkey Store were reasonably solid gains year-over-year in segment profit for most of the quarters. As you saw in Q1, it was a much more modest gain. That's probably more of the mode we would expect now for the next couple of quarters. And then by the fourth quarter, we do expect the division to be in a position to be more solidly up. So you know the fuel costs and live production were somewhat unexpected, and it was some significance we do recognize, so obviously, there are some benefits in terms of total feed costs. They're on a relatively healthy position when it comes to the commodity meat markets within the turkey complex. And we're really quite happy with their value-added growth. I mean, even though the aggregate growth for all of Jennie-O in sales was 2%, as I mentioned some of that was related to some whole bird timing, and so notwithstanding the whole birds, our value-added businesses were up more in the 4% to 5% range. So we're very happy with that. Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So the underlying sort of profitability of the business continues to move in the right direction. It's I would -- is it fair to say that this issue should be transitory? And it seems like a couple more quarters is sort of what you're expecting. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes. Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then on refrigerated, I thought it was a very good quarter if you look at margins on a per-pound basis, probably the best one you've had in couple of years. So was it really that good? And then how do I parse out the -- or reconcile the commentary on the REV wraps and the volumes being down? I know there's a lot of moving parts, but clearly, the REV business is doing well, but will it start to show up in the revenue numbers? Or -- and if so, where? I'll pass it on. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Sure. For Refrigerated Foods, I mean, it was a good quarter. I kind of look at 3 things going well within the refrigerated group, I mean, clearly, the basic cutout margins were a lot more favorable this year than what we had experienced a year ago. Secondly, some of the more kind of market-based supply chain type items, if you recall, we talked about those last year at the Investor Day, is bacon, for example, is being challenging circumstance for part of last year. That complex is in much better shape right now. And then our higher value-added items are all -- are really doing quite well. And again, I -- in terms of the masking effect of the change in feed sales and then some of the internal transfers, I mean, if you just kind of look at the retail value-added franchises, they were up solidly above 5% growth in the aggregate with several items doing well. REV is part of that. We're -- as we've mentioned earlier, we're happy with where REV is showing up, and we do expect to see a time where you'll see that top line reflected as part of the total Refrigerated Foods results. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Larson of CL King. Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just a quick follow-up on the cutout margins, Jeff. For the kind of the upcoming quarters, I think all of us pretty much anticipate you're going to have a tighter hog supply. Is there enough room at retail for the cutout margin -- for the prices to at least be able to offset your higher costs? In other words, can you at least maintain your cutout margin for the -- for, let's say, the next 2, 3 quarters? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: The cutout margins were quite favorable in Q1. In our very current environment, they remain favorable, but -- and we've known from the last 2 years that, that can be mercurial. I mean, it -- and when you add in the effect of PED and what kind of a variable that might be is, I guess we're not counting on cutout margins staying at today's level, but that's where they are today. Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Yes, I just didn't -- I'm just trying to get a feel for whether there's enough room in the whole meat complex. Obviously, you've got very high beef prices, and chicken prices have moved up, too, because your supplies have been constrained there as well. So it seems like there's the ability at retail to get to pricing that you need to offset that lower supply. But that's just my observation. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. Eric J. Larson - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And number two, could you talk a little bit about -- more about MegaMex? Obviously, your equity earnings in the quarter were about half of what they were a year ago. And is it just a margin issue with input costs? And are they going to price to try to pick some of that back up in the back half or the final 9 months of your year? Or how should we look at that equity line? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Well, MegaMex, I mean, we talked last year about an earnout composition related to the Fresherized Food piece, and so really, for the remaining quarters of this year, that was still, on a percentage basis, hold down what ultimately MegaMex will contribute to the company. Otherwise, I mean, you have -- it's -- there are quite a few factors. I mean, there's peso exchange factors. There are some supply factors. We've had some uneveness in terms of business performance. The Don Miguel piece was a little bit softer in this quarter both in sales and in terms of some margin squeeze. On the other hand, the HERDEZ line was really quite strong, and we're happy with the sales of the Wholly -- the fresherized, the Wholly Guacamole item. So overall, we're still very high on what MegaMex is going to be able to do for the company, but we're kind of swimming through some choppy seas in terms of that equity and earnings line for probably the next couple of quarters. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Rachel Nabatian of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Rachel Nabatian : First question is a follow-up to Akshay's. On Jennie-O, are you running the business as well as you thought you would internally? The cold weather and fuel costs are things that we've heard about the commodity chicken operators, but the depths and the expected duration of the negative impact, hasn't been to the same extent as what you have discussed today. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. Yes, I mean, we're -- we think the team up there really does a very good job in terms of trying to anticipate potential challenges. I mean, the whole situation related to propane and we've got into a mode here during January where we were a little bit concerned as to whether we would even get any propane. And when you have live turkeys in a barn, that's a very significant problem. We did survive through that time frame but with much more significant costs than what our initial plans had been built around. We do believe that there'll be somewhat of a transitory effect of those costs as we finally get out of the cold weather and hopefully, the markets return to some normalcy. We're seeing some improvement on the natural gas front already in terms of the market coming back a little bit more normal situation and would expect propane to follow. But overall, I mean, it's -- I would agree that we would have even a stronger quarter at Jennie-O but for those conditions, but I think the team's doing what they can to weather those. Rachel Nabatian : Okay, that's fair. And then just one follow-up question on REV wraps and protein snacking trends. So I just got back from CAGNY, and almost every presenter had a focus on protein. And then Kraft and Hillshire Brands were introducing meat plates, plates with meat, nuts and cheese or chicken with dipping sauce. And so I guess I just wanted to know your thoughts on this and if you think it's a positive since it'll grow the category. I believe these products are generally next to REV wraps in-store. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. Well, I mean, it's early to tell. I mean, some of those products are just going to get in market this spring. I mean, they've been shown to the retailers, but in terms of actual shelf impact, we obviously believe in the concept that meat or meat and cheese combinations could be a positive element for consumers when it comes to snacking opportunities. And so it's certainly not stunning to us that others have looked at the marketplace the same way and have come up with different offerings. I mean, it's -- I think the offerings that I've seen are really all quite different from each other, so there certainly is the possibility that they could well be complementary and hit consumers at slightly different occasions or maybe a slightly different age audience. But in terms of what we're looking to accomplish with REV, we're happy with what we've seen, and we continue to gain shelf placements even in the environment of others offering -- introducing new items. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Sorry to beat a dead horse here. But if I kind of think about the turkey business, is it fair to say about $20 million over a 3-quarter period is kind of the estimated cost associated with this? Is that a fair number? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: You're talking about fuel alone? Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Yes. Just from a 3-quarter impact, first, second and third quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: If you're looking just fuel cost by itself, that number is low. But we obviously have other things offsetting some of the fuel, unexpectedly high fuel. But as we -- we use a significant amount of fuel in the operation. So it was north of $10 million for -- on a 1-quarter basis. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. So actually, the more interesting question I hope is, all right, so now you had greater pressure from that, which was unexpected. What was better than expected to offset this throughout the whole organization? Because if you're saying $20 million to $30 million is low, obviously, you've had other successes that may not -- were not in your forecast as well. So what actually is exceeding your expectations across your portfolio? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. Refrigerated Foods ended up doing a little bit better than we thought. We knew they were going to have a positive year, but the overall total in terms of their gain year-over-year was more significant than we had originally planned. And we are attaining kind of better than pro forma benefits from Skippy peanut butter in both the grocery and international segment. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Great. And my final question is on the Compleats, what is the -- I mean, in SPAM, what do you think the progress will be throughout the year in terms of the build? Because it seems like this is again another -- one other piece of your portfolio that has not been as good as we would have expected, but it sounds like you guys are addressing it again. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Ken, I don't have a real clean answer for you on that. I mean, it's been a little bit of a puzzle even internally. We thought maybe we had turned the corner a little bit last year. We had a couple of really pretty strong quarters with Compleats heading into Q4, and kind of later in the year, it was a little softer. And then Q1, clearly, it did not meet our expectations. So we're hopeful that the new marketing effort and the new -- and some of the promotions we have with the customers will get that back on the right trajectory. We think we've introduced some items that consumers like in terms of the breakfast Compleats items. But time will tell here. I mean, I would agree with you that, that's been one of our franchises that's been a little bit more of a struggle for us. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : A question around the very strong margins in fresh pork and kind of how you think about pricing in your value-added products because it looks like hog costs will go up going into that spring-summer time frame. Are you thinking that you're going to focus on passing along those prices in your packaged meats items? Or are you thinking of more taking a balanced approach and saying, \"Okay, I'm making a lot in fresh pork. Maybe I don't need to take as much on my packaged meats.\"? Jody H. Feragen: Sure, Farha. This is Jody. We always evaluate where we're at with our cost structure and the prices that we go to the retailers with. And in some instances, like the supply chain items, it's probably a more rapid change. Certainly in some of foodservice areas, we have contracts that have levers that move along with the cost of goods. I would expect that we'll continue to evaluate and look at where we need to take pricing. And if it's appropriate at the time, we'll -- we won't be the only ones with those higher input costs in the industry. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then so your -- sort of how much timing is required for you if we see -- because we see that summer hogs are going to be really expensive. You need to start talking about pricing with retailers now? Or can you -- or is it all automatically or formulaic? We're just trying to understand how you're planning on managing that summer hog hit. Jody H. Feragen: Sure. From the retail perspective, I would say the team's probably looking at it right now. It'll be dependent on evaluating those gaps in our supply chain and what we think it's going to do to us internally. So I would believe the team is working on it now. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: And on the grocery side, we actually have gone to our customers and notified them of pricing on such as the beef-based items, such as Hormel chili, Mary Kitchen hash and also on SPAM luncheon meat. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : That's helpful. And sort of the degree of pricing that you've taken on those, roughly? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Low to mid-single digit. It varies by item. Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then this has been -- sort of you've had China with that Skippy business for about a quarter now. Kind of now that you've had it, how do you feel about it? Have you been able to kind of marry SPAM and Skippy in China? And how is that working out? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: It's working out well. I mean, it's interesting. In terms of our quarter 1 results, our international team actually didn't get their hands on the business as quickly to be able to benefit fully from it in the quarter. They kind of by January kind of had the full control, and so they got 1 month worth of full benefit of integration of China. But they're quite happy with what they've been able to do with some of the distributors, not only in China but in some of the other Asian-based markets where we have seen an ability to kind of lever at least the attention level or if somebody can carry both a SPAM and a Skippy as items into the marketplace. So -- and then it's really -- it's way too early in terms of any sort of operating synergies. I mean, we literally have had our team helping the local group there for a very short period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from Akshay Jagdale. Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask about Skippy. I think last quarter, you said you wouldn't talk about that line item like financially separately. But are you -- it seems like it's going better. So can you give us some more color on what's going better? Is it the peanut cost issue? Or is it just distribution and maybe a little bit more color on what's driving that? Obviously, the sales execution seems to be better, but anything to help us understand the performance of Skippy within the context of the category because the other big brand has had some issues in recent months? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. Well, I mean, the costs have remained benign, so that's been positive overall for the net margin for the business. But probably the bigger factor that has been the consumer reception to our positioning with the item. We -- as we took the item over, we found there were some retailers that had either no Skippy items or pretty scant section even though we could identify there were long-standing consumers within that marketplace. And so they were quite receptive to the notion of us getting back in and becoming supportive behind it. And we coupled that with promotional support. Clearly, it -- especially on a year-over-year basis, if you think about it, this was the quarter that last year the business was for sale. So I don't blame the seller that they probably weren't spending a lot of time promoting the product that quarter. So on a year-over-year basis especially, we certainly drove some added feature activity but our feature spending on this item is now at a level that's kind of commensurate with being the #2 player in the category. It allows us to generate some good solid growth in terms of the top line but also is living up to our performance expectations in terms of margins. Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And now you're going to put some marketing behind it and then sort of the innovation piece will come after that. Is that how we... Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes, exactly, Akshay. So the timing, I mean, we're looking at back-to-school time for the advertising. I mean, we're still settling on kind of the final new campaign themes and what the media elements will be. But I would -- you should look for it in the later part of our fiscal year as the kids go back to school in the fall. And then the new product innovation -- and we have some closer-end things that will hit the market here soon. But in terms of kind of a more major, what we talked about, sort of the out of the jar type newer opportunities, those definitely are more 2015, probably not even right out of the gate 2015. But we'll follow on soon after when the marketing kicks off. Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And just one last one on grocery, just can you talk a little bit about the environment. Obviously, the center of the store is quite pressured, and we've heard that a lot in CAGNY. But I don't think it's clear to anybody, really, why the consumers are so strapped especially on their food purchase. And so any -- what are your -- what's your read on that situation? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Well, for us, the center of the store was somewhat choppy. I mean, we had items such as SPAM and Compleats that ended up having declines year-over-year. And so certainly, you can look at those and say, gee, we're experiencing some kind of at least short-term contraction of those franchises in this current environment. On the other hand, we had several items that did well, like bacon bits and chili and HERDEZ and Wholly. And so we were, I guess, blessed, if you will, with a lot of niche relatively young items in some cases that are still finding more and more consumers. And so we're maybe a little less than the mode of having a lot of high household penetrations, extremely mature franchises. And so we seem to be able to expand our consumer base even in this current economic environment. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back to management for any closing. Jana Haynes : Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Hormel Foods. Have a great day. Operator : And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the conference call for today. Again, we thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 28 through 35 in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 26, 2014, for more details. It can be accessed on our website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Good morning. We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.52 per share, up 13% over last year. Operating profit increased by 14% with four of our five segments registering gains this quarter. In terms of the top line, we generated record sales of $2.24 billion, an increase of 4% over last year with a 1% volume decline. I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment profit increased 16%, aided in part by a favorable comparison to fiscal 2013, which included SKIPPY peanut butter acquisition cost. Dollar sales were flat versus last year. We have now left our acquisition of the SKIPPY peanut butter business. so we are no longer providing quarterly segment sales without SKIPPY peanut butter sales. Higher pork, beef and avocado input costs, squeezed margins in our Grocery Products segment. To mitigate these higher costs, we increased prices during the second quarter on our SPAM family of products, Hormel chili and Dinty Moore stew. These products, along with Hormel Compleats microwave meals, all experienced year-over-year sales declines. We also increased prices on our Wholly Guacamole products. Sales gains in Grocery Products were led by SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel bacon toppings and the HERDEZ line of products within our MegaMex Foods joint venture. We are excited about our new SKIPPY Singles peanut butter items launched this quarter. These six packs of single-served, one and a half ounce cups are offered in SKIPPY Creamy and SKIPPY Natural Creamy varieties and are excellent for on-the-go meals or snacks. Segment operating profit for Refrigerated Foods was up 38%. Higher pork operating margins and growth in our foodservice area, more than offset margin pressures due to higher raw material costs. Sales for Refrigerated Foods increased 10%, led by retail sales of our Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel REV Snack Wraps and Hormel Country Crock side dishes. We also enjoyed sales growth in our Foodservice businesses, including such items as our Hormel FIRE BRAISED Meats, Old Smokehouse Pecanwood Smoked Bacon, and Natural Choice deli meats. Segment volume was flat compared to last year driven by reduced commodity sales, as we increased internally utilization of raw materials in our value-added products. Our Foodservice team continues to focus on meeting the needs of our customers with our latest innovation, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon. This product delivers a crisp, delicious, pre-cooked bacon that performs in taste like it was cooked from raw. Segment profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store increased 2%. As we discussed on our call last quarter, the unusually cold winter along with abnormally high propane and natural gas prices, negatively impacted our live turkey productivity in margins, because turkey\u2019s average at 22-week growing cycle. these higher cost turkeys were marketed in our second quarter and will continue to work through our system. We have also experienced lower bird weights impacting volumes throughout our system to Jennie-O Turkey Store segment reported second quarter dollar sales, 1% lower than last year with a volume decline of 5%. Other macro conditions including lower corn costs and higher turkey commodity prices, along with growth in our value-added product sales allowed our Jennie-O Turkey Store team to generate at least a modest increase in operating profit during the second quarter. For example, our investment in Make The Switch media campaign drove heightened consumer interest in the featured product, Jennie-O fresh ground turkey tray packs and ground turkey chubs. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 26% and a sales decrease of 12%, largely driven by the expiration of the agreement in July of 2013 allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes into foodservice trade channels. Our Specialty Foods scheme was able to generate gains in our nutritional products business during Q2. Our International & Other team turned in another strong quarter. segment profit increased 34% and sales grew 23%. this is the first full quarter in which we are including our SKIPPY operations in China. Strong export sales of SKIPPY peanut butter and fresh pork along with growth in our China operations, drove the positive results. Looking ahead to the second half, we expect elevated beef, pork, turkey, and avocado costs to continue to squeeze margins on many of our value-added products. Pricing actions taken this quarter will partially mitigate margin pressures, but will likely impact sales growth. on the other hand, the addition of the SKIPPY peanut butter business has added additional balance to our portfolio, moderating some of these overall input cost pressures. We anticipate pork raw material supplies that tighten significantly later in our third quarter, impacting our great food segment. Our team has done a good job preparing for these potential raw material challenges. due to anticipated lower hog supplies, today, we notified our Fremont, Nebraska employees that we will reduce our harvest operations to four days a week beginning in June. We will work closely with our employees and customers to keep them up-to-date on any additional changes that may impact them. The overall impact of tighter pork supplies on our industry remains to be seen. We continue expect the year-over-year sales and profit growth from our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment, our growth will be at more modest level than initially anticipated. Finally, we are enjoying significant growth in our international segment and look for this to continue going forward. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 guidance range of $2.17 to $2.27 per share, but expect our full year earnings to be toward the lower end of this range. The elevated input costs due to tighter supplies of many of our raw materials are transitory in nature and will normalize over time. Until then, we believe our experienced team will navigate these challenges and continue to deliver growth. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information, relating to the second quarter. Jody H. Feragen: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 totaled $140.1 million or $0.52 per share, compared to $125.5 million or $0.46 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.24 billion, compared to $2.15 billion last year, a 4% increase. Volume for the second quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, down 1% from the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 7.4% of sales, down from 8% of sales last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher last year due to SKIPPY related transactions and transition costs, totaling approximately $9 million, and primarily reflected in the Grocery Products and international segments. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.3% and 7.6% of sales. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $3.6 million in the second quarter versus $7.2 million last year. The decrease is largely the result of higher input costs at our MegaMex Foods joint venture. Advertising expense for the quarter was $34.8 million, compared to $26.1 million last year. The increase was the result of the new Make The Switch ad campaign for Jennie-O Turkey Store and advertising for Hormel chili and SPAM luncheon meat. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. We expect interest expense to be $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34%, versus 31.5% last year. For fiscal 2012 rate was lower due primarily to the benefit of settlements with various foreign and state tax jurisdictions. For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was $263.9 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was $270.4 million shares. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.9 million, versus $31.3 million last year. we expect depreciation and amortization to be $125 million to $128 million for fiscal 2014. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $215 million unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $40 million, up nearly $17 million over last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $140 million to $150 million. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Rodney? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Farha Aslam of Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Good morning, Farha. Jody H. Feragen: Good morning. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.:  Two questions, the first one on your core business. could you just give us more color on the REV Wraps, and now that it\u2019s been in the market for a while, how it\u2019s performing, and the second one is on again, on your core business on the Compleats side, it looks like your shelf-stable microwavable meals just are soft and any actions you\u2019re taking to turn that around. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Thank you, Farha. In terms of REV, we\u2019re really quite pleased with the progress of that relatively new product line. We\u2019re hitting just about the one-year anniversary of it being available broadly in the marketplace. We\u2019ve already hit our trial goal with the product and we\u2019re very close to hitting our repeat purchase goal as well. To give you a sense of scale of the product line, I mean the IRI reported sales, whether you look at the last 13 weeks or last four weeks and extrapolate out on a full year basis, we\u2019re at a pace right now of $50 million to $60 million, so that\u2019s really a quite nice introduction. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, it\u2019s not presently contributing to Refrigerated Foods segment profit in any meaningful way, because this is an investment time for that brand both in terms of advertising and slotting, but we\u2019re very pleased with the progress thus far. Compleats is a slightly different story, where we continue to see sluggish sales, when it comes to that product line. There are certainly some products within the line that are doing well, including our new Compleats breakfast items. but overall, I would say that is a watch out for us. Our team is earnestly looking at different ways to either present the products in terms of the packaging, or in terms of what should be in the product line, pricing strategies, you name it, but we recognize that we need to restore growth in our Compleats product line. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then as a follow-up, you have a very strong balance sheet, and M&A is very prevalent in the space right now. Could you give us some commentary on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of transactions, what\u2019s of interest to Hormel, and any thoughts you\u2019d have in terms of international versus domestic? Jody H. Feragen: That\u2019s a lot of questions. Let me try to answer them. First of all, we like to look for acquisitions that would add to our strategic platforms, certainly, those that are in growing categories and we certainly like number one or number two. We like them to be accretive to the segment profits, as well as accretive to the company as a whole. And we\u2019re always looking for something where we bring more than just the checkbook to the closing. Certainly, anything that offers the opportunity to expand in the international area would be equally, or if not more appealing. So that\u2019s kind of some of the things, if you look back at the SKIPPY transaction, that\u2019s really what we got with that, so certainly looking for some of that. As far as transactions, where there has been a lot of them some expected, some unexpected. So I would say there\u2019s probably some divesting of orphan brands like SKIPPY was, and then probably some consolidation, so a mixed bag there. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: And anything that\u2019s of particular interest to you? Jody H. Feragen: I have nothing to comment on right now. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens Inc.: Okay, thank you. Jody H. Feragen: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi, thank you. Jeff Ettinger : Good morning, Robert. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Good morning. I\u2019m just wondering if you Jody, whether you feel like this is the cut-in guidance, is it going to be enough? because as I look at the back half of the year, the back half still requires quite a bit of operating profit growth in order to be delivered. You\u2019ve talked about the impact of the PED virus hurting your access to supplies, rising costs. And I think Jeff; I think you said that these price increases will partially mitigate to higher input costs. So it sounds like the back half is tough. You have a very tough comp in fourth quarter. What are the things that are going to help you deliver the back half? Jody H. Feragen: Bob, I think there are some \u2013 certainly some unknowns and we\u2019ve done our best job of making estimates of what those impacts are going to be for us. I will tell you that the macro industry conditions, relating to the hog supplies probably is hitting us a little later than we originally anticipated, but we\u2019ve done our best job in factoring that. We have a few levers we can pull as far as making sure that some of the businesses have the appropriate investments to drive their business. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I guess the only thing that I could add is, I mean at a segment level, to add to Jody\u2019s comment, I mean we think Refrigerated Foods is still in a position to be a strong contributor in Q3, given the delay and impact that we just discussed. And then, by Q4, we expect Jennie-O Turkey Store to be in a position to be providing positive growth, because they worked, by that time, they worked through these weather related issues that we\u2019ve referenced. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay. Is your outlook for Q4 for Jennie-O, is it any lighter than it was before, or is your fourth quarter the same as it was, because before you were talking about fourth quarter being a very strong quarter for turkey. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: The only remaining challenge that that group will be confronted with is that the grain picture is not as positive today as it was when the year started. So then that all comes down to how successful they are at balancing that against other production costs or pricing actions. but at this point, we do expect it to be a very solid quarter for them. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : And the spike in commodity turkey prices that happened recently is that a net positive for you in fourth quarter or is it kind of neutral? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: It\u2019s a positive, but it\u2019s not a massive positive and we really don\u2019t sell a lot of commodity turkey meat in the scheme of our overall operation, obviously, it\u2019s a focus on value-added. But clearly, we would acknowledge that that\u2019s a positive for the group. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from Akshay Jagdale of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Hi, Akshay. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Hi, first question just on SKIPPY. Can you give us a little bit more color on how the business is performing in the U.S. and internationally? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Sure. We\u2019re very pleased with how SKIPPY has been performing. The most recent quarter was a high single-digit sales gain in the U.S., so that\u2019s very strong. I think we\u2019re doing that on the basis of some of the distribution gains, we\u2019ve referenced in the past and having more effective promotions on the product line. And then we expect to complement that by fall with a new ad campaign to really kind of again, remind the SKIPPY consumers about this great brand. In terms of the outside of the U.S. sales, I mean we\u2019re just now kind of getting China online in terms of, we really don\u2019t have the comps there. The non-China comps were up as well. So overall, we\u2019re pleased with where SKIPPY is in both the U.S. and international markets. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And just a follow-up to that and more broadly, can you give us an update on your marketing plans for this year? You\u2019d started off with a pretty significant increase in marketing and if I remember correctly, the budget last year was around $100 million and you were expecting it to be up almost 30% this year. Can you just give us an update and let us know if anything has changed per se in that particular plan? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes. we do expect to still have a significant increase year-over-year in terms of our marketing spend. It won\u2019t probably be at the 30% level, it may be more like 15% to 20%. For example, we\u2019ll be coming out a little bit later with the SKIPPY campaign. We really want to make sure we got the messaging right, and we think the timing it to the back-to-school time is more effective than say an earlier summer launch, so that is one budgetary change we\u2019ve made. But overall we do expect to be in the kind of might be the 115 to 120 range in terms of those expenditures. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: But there the only change here is you sort of delayed some of the investments on SKIPPY, it\u2019s a timing issue, correct? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Well, SKIPPY I mean, once we do come out with it we\u2019ll certainly put a solid effort against an effort that will then overlap into fiscal 2015. So yes there is a timing change at least in relation to SKIPPY. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay and just on this commodity cost pressure issue and your view that it\u2019s temporary, can you give us a little bit more color on what product categories and more importantly, from a modeling perspective, I mean where does that flow through? It seems like Grocery Product is probably the division that\u2019s hit the most by it but you also have a significant value added presence in Refrigerated. So can you give us a sense as sort of where you\u2019re seeing more of the weakness from a segment perspective? And then just a little bit more color in terms of what products are getting impacted and are you taking more pricing now and as such when that flows through the margins should normalize? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Actually I would agree with the characterization that I think the Grocery group probably has the most franchises that are impacted by what the cost pressures we\u2019re experiencing right now. Our outlook would be that when it comes to say the pork prices, that we do think this will \u2013 it\u2019ll be several month process but we don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a systemic change in the cost picture in the pork industry. The beef price increases everybody kind of saw coming and certainly is a little bit more of a systemic challenge, I think in the long run they are expecting to build beef herds back but that\u2019s not going to happen overnight. We mentioned avocados pressures those are kind of related to the drought in California, although we don\u2019t source significant avocados from California. It is a Global Market ultimately and so when those supplies tighten up or expected to tighten up when prices go up we\u2019ve experienced cost increases even from our supplies in Mexico, Peru and Chile, as well. We clearly the value-added items within the Refrigerated Foods group are also being impacted by the cost increases. Our Foodservice team has been more successful to date in adjusting pricing to match up against new cost reality, but our retail Meat Products group is catching up and should be in a position to be back in a balance before the year is over. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So just to be clear, what changed internally from an input cost and sort of margin expectation? Is it just that the cost escalated more than you were expecting and as such, there\u2019s just a lag, or is it that the pricing is not as effective and that is not, you\u2019re unable to pass it through? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: It\u2019s really on the cost side. We talked about the impact of our operations in terms of the sort of expected four-day work week in June in Fremont, and so clearly from a hog intake standpoint that we\u2019re expecting the impact to our organization to be sort of kind of late third quarter early fourth quarter. But the price impact of what\u2019s going on in the country in terms of pork supplies was very pronounced during the second quarter and very sharp and that\u2019s always probably the hardest scenarios when we get a quick, deep increase in cost. Trim costs, selling costs, you name it, they\u2019ve rocketed up and those have been very difficult to price against. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Just one last one for Jody. Can you give us a little bit color into the cash balance that went down pretty significantly this quarter? It seemed like it was working capital related, but it was a little bit unusual at least from my expectations. Was that something you were expecting, or can you give us a little bit more color into what drove that? Jody H. Feragen: Sure, you\u2019re right. Working capital was a big use of cash for the quarter. We saw a pretty significant inventory build, part of that was driven by just those rapidly rising costs that were going into our products, so not necessarily more tonnage, but higher costs. And then also driven by, I think, some of the comments that we\u2019ve made about preparing for these potential holes in the hogs where we\u2019re taking certain of our valued primals and having them be in storage so we have enough supply for later. So those would be the biggest drivers on the inventory. We did see a reduction in our payables, specifically related to the timing of the tax payment. So that was expected. And then really from a free cash flow standpoint, our CapEx spending is up year-over-year and that as we messaged even from the beginning of the fiscal year, we\u2019re making certain investments in productivity improvements, we have new vendoring operation that\u2019s kind of just the cost of doing business that will be much more efficient with that. And then adding some capacities certainly the new bacon one product resulted in some expenditures to get that product launched, so a mix of some not repair and maintenance, but ongoing upgrades to existing facilities, as well as some new expansions. So those would be the biggest. I would expect by the end of the year that we will get our inventories down at some more normalized levels, but really trying to work through these difficult times that we\u2019re expecting. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Maybe first to kind of get a little bit more on the PED side, just trying to get a sense of if the impact of summary, you announced the closing of our reduced work weeks in one of your plants. If the impact is as you expected it would be, if it\u2019s been more pronounced and a longer tail and characterize how the evolution of PED has shaped up relative to your expectations. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. For our operations, Adam, it came a little bit more slowly than maybe we had originally feared, but clearly at this point based on our conversations with the producers with whom we have contracts, we expect tightened numbers now for the summer and that\u2019s what led us to go at our four day work week. Clearly a number of other processes in the industry had already made that move. There were other regions of the country where the impact of the illness that hit earlier, and so I think their tightening of numbers had already occurred. The other thing that everyone in the industry is monitoring is sort of is the recovery side from it and I think everyone would tell you at this point it\u2019s not a 100% recovery yet. That\u2019s what you seek to accomplish when you have an outbreak like this, but the entities that once they\u2019ve kind of had the exposure to it and they get back into operation, they are not in many cases hitting the 100% level and so that\u2019s a little bit of a wildcard for us as we head into the latter part of the year or even early next year, in terms of what kind of numbers we might see. Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it, and so it\u2019s really at this point too early to think about how long this tail can be, your discussions with your suppliers for the next few months will be the big determination on what the pork supply looks like in the first half of your fiscal 2015? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes, definitely an impact into Q4, but yes, kind of early to tell for 2015. Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay and that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe switching gears, following-up on Farha\u2019s question, obviously, your balance sheet is a great asset and in a great position; however, with the ownership of the foundation where it is, it kind of constrains you a little bit in your capital allocation. Can you talk about any perspective repurchases of shares from the foundation, or there would be any authority or interest in that regard to just give you a more balanced, more flexible capital allocation process? Jody H. Feragen: Well, that would obviously be up to the foundation, if their interest is in selling any shares. We certainly do have authorization that would allow us to do any repurchases of shares. We made some small purchases during the quarter and we continue to assess what our expected uses for cash flow are and balance that with what kind of ROI we get on the investment and our internal stocks. So I\u2019m not in control of what the foundation wants to do with their shares. Adam Samuelson \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right, fair enough, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks very much. Operator : The next question comes from Diane Geissler of CLSA. Please go ahead. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Hi, Diane. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : I wanted to ask about the turkey business. Is there any way to quantify what you think the impact of some of these sort of, I guess, call them one-off really terrible winter in the propane prices spiking. I\u2019m assuming that you had hedges in place, but that maybe you came under like a force Majeure, where your suppliers said that we don\u2019t have it and therefore, you have to go on to the spot market, was that a factor? And then I guess you said 22 weeks, so should we assume it will impact your margins all the way into the first quarter of 2015, or do you think that it will be limited to 2014? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Well, on the propane side, yes, we did have some forward positions in place and yes, we did get impacted by force Majeure clauses, as they had pipeline issues and other issues this winter, so that was \u2013 that certainly exacerbated an already difficult situation when it came to just share market pricing, because we don\u2019t forward by all of it clearly. so we did have to scramble and cover some of that on the open market. In terms of your second question on timing, 22 weeks, but the bite from the winter, really obviously, took place in the primary winter months kind of, December, January and February, even maybe a little March. So now, we don\u2019t \u2013 we really don\u2019t expect the impact from that to trail all the way into our fiscal 2015, in fact, even by the Q4, we should be in a better position when it comes to that impact. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Can you quantify the propane impact, just in terms of if it had been delivered on a hedged basis, versus you buying in the spot market? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I really can\u2019t give you that detail. I can give you that, just in terms of this overall for Jennie-O, we provided guidance at the beginning of the year that we really had expected and hoped that Jennie-O would be in a growth position really, frankly quarter-after-quarter in fiscal 2015, and you can see from the results that what\u2019s happened is it\u2019s been basically flat, where it\u2019s not like we lost a lot of ground, they still have really solid operating margins, but as basically, propane is one of the deltas that have driven it from a good gain to flat. But there\u2019s other ones such as the feed, not being quite as favorable as we thought that has been a factor as well. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Can I just ask what you\u2019ve actually communicated to your employees at the plant for furloughs like how long they should expect to be furloughed or has it ended? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay. so we just did that this morning. So we wanted to be on a consistent basis with public information, talking to them about an impact starting in June. We talked about being closed on Fridays within that plant, depending on the hog flow in a given week; there may be opportunities to make up some additional hours on the Monday through Thursday schedule. The summer in the past has sometimes been a time where people are looking to take vacation, or you have some scheduling differentials anyway. so what we\u2019ve said is kind of indefinite. We certainly anticipate that it will certainly last at least a couple of months, but we\u2019ll just kind of have to see on a rolling basis, as to when we think we have the numbers back to be in a position to restore that plant to full hours. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Larson of C.L King. Please go ahead. Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Hi Eric. Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: I have a very specific Jennie-O question, and it relates to your energy issues up there. I know there are a number of sort of natural gas pipeline projects going on in Wisconsin. and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re anywhere close to any of those gas lines that you could potentially put the CapEx into, and convert your grow-up facilities from propane to natural gas. Is there any distinct possibility that something like that could happen where you wouldn\u2019t then have to be so tied into specifically propane? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: It\u2019s a great question, Eric and indeed, the team is actively pursuing that. We actually were pursuing it even before the propane shortage, just because natural gas was looking attractive, obviously at a time before that. It\u2019s a somewhat gradual conversion for us, just fairly in-depth process, we\u2019re on kind of a maybe 20 farm a year schedule in order looking at a conversion in that regard. so there won\u2019t be an immediate solution to anything, but definitely a good point there in terms of a better long-term position for those facilities. Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay, good. I\u2019m glad to hear that you\u2019re actually within striking distance, where you can actually do some conversions, which over the long run, it\u2019s easier to hedge natural gas and everything else, and I think it would be a lot more reliable supply. The second follow-on question that I have, when you talk about the favorable turkey commodity markets, and I know that you have moved a tremendous amount of your volume away from those commodity markets into your further value add, is that still in general, can that be a significant swing factor quarter-to-quarter as to the performance of the commodity markets? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes, I mean it\u2019s still relevant. I mean we certainly still sell a number of the dark meat items on a commodity basis, either in international marketplaces, or in some cases to other manufactures. so I don\u2019t want to discount and pretend that that\u2019s not a factor at all. It definitely can be a relatively big swing, but clearly the emphasis for Jennie-Our, the 75% to 80% of the portfolio are the value-added items and we\u2019ve really taken pains to try to match up our overall production within the system to those value-added items. The fact that we were short weights this last quarter again, kind of dampened our ability to take advantage of those commodity markets on a more broad basis, because again, we needed to grab as many pounds as possible to make sure we were supporting the value-added items. Eric J. Larson \u2013 C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sachin Shah of Albert Fried. Please go ahead. Sachin Shah \u2013 Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. I just want to talk to you about your kind of acquisition strategy. There has been kind of a lot of speculation out there, what companies you may be interested or not interested in, so maybe, you can just highlight, maybe in a summary of just your acquisition kind of strategy and what you guys are looking for to deploy capital. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I think Jody addressed that earlier. I mean we clearly have been active in the acquisition community over the last dozen years, completing over $2 billion worth of deals that have helped the growth of our company. We clearly are in a position, we have the financial wherewithal, and I think the team capabilities to do other deals in terms of general spaces, I mean you can get online this afternoon and watch the Bank of Montreal conference and we\u2019ll have a slide in our deck that talks about different areas where we\u2019ve made acquisitions in the past. But we really don\u2019t provide any specificity about potential targets going forward and that\u2019s something that the team keeps on a proprietary basis. Sachin Shah \u2013 Albert Fried & Co. LLC:  Okay. Any just maybe follow-up comment on the deal activity in the space right now, I\u2019ve seen a few transactions already in 2014. So, just maybe some color on your thoughts on what that means for the sector, industry and use specifically. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes. I don\u2019t know that I have a perspective that would be any better than an investor who is following the space. Clearly, there have been some deals announced recently. I\u2019ve been in the shop now nine years and there has been an ebb and flow of deal during that whole timeframe, there\u2019s fairly notable changes in the industry, I think that\u2019s just part of what happens in modern business. But I guess I don\u2019t have any specific perspective to offer you at this point. Sachin Shah \u2013 Albert Fried & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions. Are there any other points you wish to raise? Jana L. Haynes: No, thank you. I just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and we will be holding a webcast later of our presentation today at 4 P.M. Eastern. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the second quarter earnings call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Hormel Foods\u2019 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Jana Haynes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jana L. Haynes: Thank you. Good morning.

It can be accessed on our website. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Thank you, Jana. We announced record third quarter earnings this morning of $0.51 per share, up 21% over the last year. Operating profit increased by 23%. We also achieved record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 6% over the last year with a 1% volume decline. The resiliency of our balanced business model was evidenced this quarter by our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth in a highly elevated input cost environment with three of our five segments registering profit gains. I will now take you through each segment. Our Grocery Products segment profit decreased 36% and sales were down 3%. Pricing actions taken earlier this year on our core canned meat and microwave meal items slowed sales of these products. Record high beef, pork and chicken input costs also significantly impacted margins. The center of the store has become a more challenging environment for many food categories. We have some franchises such as our Dinty Moore stew and Compleats microwave meals that appeared to be affected as well. However, we have several items positioned in the center of the store that continue to grow even in this more difficult time, such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel bacon toppings and the HERDEZ line of salsas and sauces within our MegaMex Foods joint venture. We will continue to build on the momentum of the SKIPPY peanut butter brand with national advertising during the back-to-school season this fall after many years off air. Segment operating profit for the Refrigerated Foods group was up 101%. The large increase was driven by beneficial pork operating margins, which were stronger than expected and growth of retail and foodservice value added products. Pork cutout values remained unseasonably high this summer, which more than offset record high hog costs. At the end of the quarter, we had anticipated volatility in the Refrigerated Foods segment due to tight hog supply, but our team did an excellent job by curing hogs and managing inventories to support growth of our key franchises. As part of the preparation for low hog availability, we\u2019ve reduced our Fremont, Nebraska harvest operation to four days per week through most of the summer. We have recently returned to a normalized schedule. Dollar sales for Refrigerated Foods increased 12% led by retail sales of our Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel REV Snack Wraps and LLOYD\u2019S ribs. We also enjoyed sales growth in our foodservice business, including such items as our Hormel FIRE BRAISED Meats, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, and Hormel fully cooked sausage. Segment volume was flat compared to last year driven by lower commodity sales, as we have increased internal utilization of raw materials in our value-added products along with higher pricing on key retail items to mitigate margin exposure. Our Refrigerated Foods team launched distribution of Hormel REV, A.M. Breakfast REVs this quarter. We introduced four varieties each with flatbread, egg, cheese and breakfast meat. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a segment profit increase of 42%, driven by value-added sales growth, strong turkey commodity pricing and beneficial grain input costs. The last of the flocks impacted by the harsh winter weather and elevated fuel cost, moved through our system during the quarter. Segment dollar sales rose 4% on a volume decline of 2%. High turkey commodity prices more than offset lower volumes driven by the timing of whole bird sales in the retail channel. Sales of our value-added items experienced nice growth this quarter, led by our Jennie-O Turkey Store ground turkey items, which continued to benefit from our turkey taco advertising campaign won earlier this year. Value-added products in our foodservice and deli lines also drove sales growth. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 25%, and a sales decrease of 10%, largely resulting from the expiration of the agreement in July 2013, allowing Diamond Crystal Brands to sell certain sugar substitutes into foodservice trade channels. This is the final quarter of challenging comparisons related to the expiration of this agreement. We completed the acquisition of CytoSport Holdings on August 11, 2014 and welcome the team to Hormel Foods. We look forward to realizing the synergies between CytoSport and our existing protein-rich sports nutrition operations and applying our innovation capabilities to maximize the potential of the Muscle Milk brand in the fast-growing sports nutrition space. Our international and other segment profit increased 12% and sales grew 18%. results were led by strong sales from our Beijing and Shanghai facilities into the foodservice channel, along with the addition of the SKIPPY business within China. exports of our SPAM family of products were impacted by high input costs, during the quarter. as we move into the fourth quarter, we expect elevated meat input cost to continue to squeeze margins on certain of our value-added products, especially in our Grocery Products segment. Pork operating margins will likely remain seasonably positive this fall, as hog cost began to moderate with better supply, but difficult comparisons to last year will minimize this factor for our Refrigerated Food segment in Q4. We expect our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment to finish the year strong with value-added sales growth, continued high turkey commodity prices and beneficial grain markets. Specialty Foods has lapped the expiration of it sugar substitute contract and should return to year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. CytoSport results will also be included for Q4, increasing revenues for the segment, but not materially impacting earnings net of the acquisition closing cost. We look for our International & Other segment to continue to drive growth, led by our China operations and SKIPPY peanut butter export business, offset in part by high U.S. meat input costs, impacting exports of our fresh pork and SPAM family of products in the near-term. Taking all of these significant factors into account, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 guidance range of $2.17 to $2.27 per share. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter. Jody H. Feragen:  Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 rose 21% to $138 million, or $0.51 per share, compared to $113.6 million, or $0.42 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.28 billion, compared to $2.16 billion last year, a 6% increase. Volume for the third quarter was 1.17 billion pounds, down 1% from the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 6.7% of sales versus 7% last year. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be about 7.1% to 7.3% of sales. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $3.5 million in the third quarter versus $1.3 million last year. The increase is largely due to the improved performance at our MegaMex Foods joint venture. Advertising expense for the quarter was $21.1 million, compared to $22.4 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. We expect interest expense to be about $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2014. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34.7%, versus 35.7% in fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2014, we expect the effective tax rate to be about 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was $264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was $270.4 million. We repurchased 267,000 shares of common stock during the third quarter, spending about $13 million. we have 8.9 million shares remaining to be purchased under the current authorization in place. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.5 million, versus $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be about a $130 million in fiscal 2014. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $34.8 million, up $11.5 million over the last year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million. As Jeff indicated, we closed on the acquisition of CytoSport Holdings using available cash and a portion of our $300 million credit revolver to fund the $450 million acquisition. We expect to repay the credit revolver by the end of fiscal 2014. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Danny? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Inc. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Hi, Farha. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Congratulations for a great quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Thank you. Jody H. Feragen: Thank you. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: We\u2019ve noticed a lot of variation between divisions in terms of performance and so just starting with Grocery Products those earnings were very impacted with the higher commodity cost. How do you think that recovery goes and when do you think earnings can get back to flat year-over-year and back into growth? Jeffrey M. Ettinger:  Obviously Grocery Products was the one hit hardest by the input cost environment during the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter to be still negative year-over-year, but not to the depth we\u2019re reporting here today. Now we\u2019re not in a position to give 2015 guidance here, but the long-term \u2013 our long-term outlook for the Grocery division is that it should be able to drive growth. We have some excellent franchises still within that business such as all our Mexican Foods businesses as well as SKIPPY and SPAM continues to have general strength on a long-term basis. So we\u2019ll provide more specific guidance on the next call in terms of what 2015 will look like that we should start trending in the positive direction. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Okay. And then a question really on MegaMex, I mean earnings in that business almost tripled. What is the trend? How should we think about that business going forward and what\u2019s driving the improvement? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Well, Q3 last year, I mean to be fair, we had a fairly significant hit, remember we announced in terms of the added earn out on the fresh foods component, and so in terms of comparison that that was an easier comparison if you will for the MegaMex group. They\u2019ve had some costs squeeze within their group as well frankly both on the Don Miguel side and in terms of the avocado based products. Avocado costs seem to be normalizing and so and the top line is excellent in terms of the Wholly Guacamole franchise, so we\u2019re encouraged and excited about that and the HERDEZ brand is very strong and we just continue to rack up double-digit of top line increases for the variety items sold under that authentic Mexican brand. So overall MegaMex is a key component not only to the Grocery Products, but to the total company period on trend products, and we think that\u2019ll continue to deliver growth for us. Farha Aslam \u2013 Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Hey, good morning, everyone. Jeffrey M. Ettinger:  Hey, Ken. Jody H. Feragen:  Good morning. Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  So, one strategy question, Hormel has been very successful of gaining outside market shares in niche categories, that\u2019s kind of your \u2013 over the last decade or so. You moved into SKIPPY, obviously you made a bid for Ragu. Could you think \u2013 and any of this performance you see what you are doing here, the success has been always in your niche categories. Do you think that you are starting to move away from that and do you think that\u2019s a good thing or bad thing? Can you talk about that and then I have a follow-up. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: : We\u2019ve had identified that we really thought we needed to provide more on the go offerings, and so hence our innovation with REV, that was a big motivator frankly behind the MUSCLE MILK acquisition was that \u2013 people are viewing those items in many cases as meal replacements, consumed on-the-go. And so again we are looking in most cases for leading share brands that we can drive with our marketing and hopefully operate on an efficient basis. Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay, my follow-up question, what would limit the Turkey margins from moving up from this 17% \u2013 16.9% or 17% level going forward, it seems like this quarter kind of as represented what the future will look like if not even better, is there something that I\u2019m missing here? Jody H. Feragen: : Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : So you don\u2019t think 17% is the right level to move \u2013 am I miss understanding you? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Well, I mean \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you are looking for a long-term number or a short-term number, as mentioned earlier we\u2019re not going to give 2015 number here today. But it would be fair to layout; obviously what\u2019s going on in the marketplace as we head into 2015 could well be in a market where the commodities are little less favorable. But I\u2019m recognizing that the grain markets could be more favorable, and so we\u2019ll just see what that \u2013 when we provide that guidance in November. Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets :  Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Operator :  We\u2019ll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Thank you, Akshay. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  So, can you give us an update on REV, the AM Wraps, you are launching I guess am I correct in understanding that the difference there is you\u2019ve added the sort of the egg component to it. So can you talk a little bit about why now with the AM Wraps instead of overall how is REV doing relative to your expectation? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Sure, Akshay. So, I mean I know on past quarters I was \u2013 I provided some estimates based on some of the early tracking with the brand, we\u2019re now in a position where we have 52 weeks of scanned data available, the sales on that basis were on $55 million on the last 52-week basis, that does not count sales into the college and university or convenience store channels, that\u2019s a little bit more, the lion shares through the Grocery channel. We\u2019re very happy with those that\u2019s one of our best ever first-year performances on our brand. We think the brand has upside in terms of its sales capabilities beyond that, even with the core items and then as you point out on top of that, we are introducing the breakfast items. a part of it is just kind of coming out with the core line first, a part of it is making through that you have the product ready and performing the way you want, I\u2019m actually really quite excited and pleased with the team, coming out with a year later if you contrast it for example to our complete line and it took a several years to get a breakfast offering, that was the right offering within that product line. Right now, we\u2019re focusing our attention on these breakfast related items on customers that already have a pretty good set of REV items. There are certain customers that really do have that in place, other certain regions of the country and certain retailers that\u2019s still spottier, or maybe they only carry three or four or five items. In those cases, we\u2019re probably saying that we may not want to come right out with two or three breakfast items until you settle little more legitimately. But we do think breakfast revenue is another excellent innovation that will drive new consumption to this product line and we\u2019ll continue to excite consumers who like the REV line. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just on SKIPPY, give us an update especially on the International operations you talked about it a little bit, but given what happened in the grocery segment this quarter it would be nice if you could sort of tell us if SKIPPY was impacted by any of that doesn\u2019t seem like it. And then more importantly, can you give us a little bit more color on the Cyto acquisition and strategically sort of longer term how that fits in and what kind of growth profile you expect from that? Thank you, and I\u2019ll get back in queue. Jeffrey M. Ettinger:  Okay. SKIPPY, we\u2019re very pleased with the domestic results for SKIPPY, on a net sales basis, lesser because of \u2013 that was a category that saw price decreases. But a volume high single-digit increase in volume still continuing to get good future activity, we\u2019ve had some nice placements in terms of distribution sales there. And we\u2019re going to work on innovating within the category, our SKIPPY Singles are off to a good start, the dark chocolate natural item is doing well; also and look for more items in 2015, maybe more in the middle of the year for that. On an international basis, it\u2019s still a little rocky to read. I mean it was positive in the sense that we obviously now own the China plant and all the production out of that plant is now being reflected in the sales. We saw a little bit of decline in business in Canada. And we also \u2013 in a couple of the Asian markets, we\u2019re still on kind of a conversion mode between our ownership and the prior ownership in terms of who has got the distribution and so forth. But overall, I mean that plant is in a good position to support growth and we expect to have that be a real growth catalyst for international going forward. On CytoSport, we were obviously very excited, last time we\u2019re on the phone with all of you was in the middle of the quarter, when we made the announcement related to the deal, we did close on that deal recently. A couple of follow-up questions that had kind of emerged, just even since we announced the deal related to the kind of this notion of all, what does Hormel bring to the party, when it comes to the Muscle Milk acquisition. So I did want to address that. We have knowledge of manufacturing and of the category, that perhaps has been overlooked a little bit, I mean our Specialty Foods group is a less branded group, and so sometimes doesn\u2019t get talked about quite as much, but we\u2019ve been manufacturing both powdered and ready-to-drink protein items for over 10 years with our Century Foods business unit that\u2019s under Specialty Foods, indeed to us. This was a great opportunity to bring a branded catalyst for that group to build apply that knowledge, the way we do in the rest of our companies to a branded item. We feel we\u2019re going to be able to bring deeper sales and category management skills to the largest market for this product line, which is the food, drug and mass market where we sell so many of our other items. And really, I mean anytime you\u2019re bringing a product line, that\u2019s frankly kind of a one-off product line, a single brand and bringing it to a portfolio where you have deeper relationships at least we found that we should be able to drive growth doing that, we certainly did that with Wholly Guacamole for one example and we should do that here. We also feel our innovation track record bodes well in terms of coming up with great new items that would fit under this brand. We\u2019re very early on; the category growth that we\u2019re looking at is still very significant. as we mentioned on the last call, our feeling and even the prior management were kind of conceded us, there was prior a little bit of lack of focus as they were in the sale process of the business. and so their share has not quite kept up with all the category growth, but notwithstanding that, I mean it still grew in terms of both the ready-to-drink components, the big Muscle Milk branded presence, as well as the full protein line. And so it should be a great growth catalyst for Specialty Foods and for Hormel going forward. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks a lot. that\u2019s excellent. Operator : Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Please go ahead. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Hi, Diane. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Congratulations on your quarter. I wanted to ask you about the outlook, which you maintained your guidance, it seems like an awfully wide range for having normally, one quarter left in the year. and I just wanted to make sure that that wasn\u2019t sending us a signal about one area of your business team, potentially problematic. I know the hog numbers have come down pretty significantly, but it sounds like you are finding adequate supply in the fact that you\u2019ve reopened your plant, the one that you have curtailed those. There is something we need to be aware of, as we move through the fourth quarter, that\u2019s kind of giving you pause and making you keep that that wide of a range for the fourth quarter? Jody H. Feragen:  So Diane, as we were sitting down this time for \u2013 at the end of our second quarter, there, we certainly did not expect the type of positive pork operating margins that we experienced in the third quarter. So I would say that\u2019s probably one thing that would lead us to have a somewhat wider range there going into the fourth quarter, but certainly feel more comfortable that we are in the middle range of that guidance instead of the lower end that we\u2019ve guided to at the end of the second quarter. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, all right. Well, that\u2019s fair enough. And then I wanted to follow up on Jeff\u2019s comments about the acquisition. so you guys have obviously signaled that you are looking to do bigger deals, I think you\u2019ve made sort of more aggressive comments at your Analyst Day last year after doing the SKIPPY transaction about big deals, small deals take as much time and kind of management time as little deals do, but if I heard you correctly Jody, you basically used your big pile of cash and your revolver, which will be paid out by the end of this fiscal year. So if you kind of rate back where you started from which is significantly under our balance sheet. So the question is really more, do you think that you could do another sizable transaction here in the near-term and then would it be a drain on the organization\u2019s ability to kind of integrate, or do you feel like you need to give the CytoSport acquisition kind of time to get integrated before you could go out and make another sizable transaction? Jana L. Haynes:  Diane, you are right. from a financial perspective, we certainly have the bandwidth to do another acquisition. And I think from organizational resource perspective, we also have the ability, especially foods might have trouble doing another one right on top of this, but we certainly would have the ability to do it from an organizational perspective. It\u2019s finding the right transaction that has the strategic fit that has the number one or number two brand, looking for something that is accretive to our margins and where we can really add some values. so something that has non-U.S. portion of the business is also very attractive. So we just need to find the right set and certainly, I believe our organization is ready to step up and do that. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC :  Can I just ask a \u2013 sorry expected to follow up to that comment, that\u2019s sort of accretive to your margin, but you\u2019re talking about accretive to your margins are on the whole, or just within the segment in which year? Jana L. Haynes:  We look generally\u2026 Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC :  Making acquisition. Jana L. Haynes:  The first step is segment, but with the ability to become accretive to the overall Hormel margins. Diane R. Geissler \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC :  Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi, thank you. I guess two questions. One is, everyone thought that the PED virus was going to have a negative impact, eventually on packing margins, and it really hasn\u2019t, are we thinking now that there is not going to be any negative impact on those processing margins? And then secondly, Grocery margins, I get it that the protein inflation flowed through here and hurt the margin, but I guess there\u2019s a little surprise that SKIPPY didn\u2019t stabilize the business enough to kind of keep them from going into single-digit. Our SKIPPY\u2019s margins lower than the margins in the rest of Grocery, and is that also an impact for why margins are lower? Jana L. Haynes: Well, I think I\u2019ll take the first part of your question regarding the pork margins. I think what the unexpected on result that we saw in the third quarter was that demands continue to hold up to cut out value. So we\u2019ve really had anticipated the hog prices to rise like they did. But then the final portions also seem to be supported by that. We are looking to continue to see that positive thread, but we are up against some pretty positive thread from the fourth quarter of last year. So don\u2019t expect that to have a significant impact on the Refrigerated Foods segment in the fourth quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: So on the Grocery side, SKIPPY\u2019s margins should be accretive ultimately for the Grocery Products group and are currently. that being said, I mean probably, the highest profitability element of the Grocery Products portfolio is the canned meat area, and that\u2019s the area where we clearly saw the biggest squeeze during the quarter, brought in part by the prior price increase that we\u2019ve taken based on just kind of long-term increases in the raw materials. and then when you add to it despite from PED in terms of the input cost on hog. I mean that really hurt their ability ultimately that deliver margin. So that\u2019s what needed to cover, that\u2019s what, to the earlier question, I mean we\u2019ll start seeing some recovery in that Q4, but not all of it and we have some of the inventories already put up with higher cost and so forth, but heading in the future we do expect that to normalize. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : And, Jeff, what is going to cause it to normalize? Do you need the protein prices to fall, because it sounds like you already to pricing earlier in the year? Do you have to take it again, or are you waiting for the protein to fall? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: That\u2019s well, I mean I guess waiting for that in the sense that we didn\u2019t feel, we\u2019ll show it, or we are in a very good position to take second pricing based off of a spike. if these inputs have become the new norm, we always do it and have to reevaluate that, but a lot of these input costs are already down, also really significantly even in the last couple of weeks. So I mean we do think that\u2019s what PED cost, it didn\u2019t end up hurting the processing margins, but it did end up driving very significant increases in inputs that we didn\u2019t still think we could price against, and we don\u2019t hopefully involve and we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ll have to, because we do think those are going to come back to a more normal level. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Just a last question, one of the concerns I hear a lot from investors about the process food industry in general is that people are paying more and more attention to help in wellness, and especially, in the meals part of the store like convenient meals. And I mean I will take the view that Dinty Moore, and chili and SPAM are kind of our own niche businesses, but microwavable meals like shelf-stable microwavable meals, I think are \u2013 could be just off trend. Do you have any view on the long-term for Compleats and what your strategy for investment there is? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: So I mean we had obviously, enjoyed very significant growth in the Compleats line during the 2000 decade almost right to the end of it. and then clearly, the product line has stagnated somewhat since then, one effort to try to attract new consumers and restore growth had been the notion of kind of going after the more health oriented consumer or a looking for higher end items and hence the introduction of our blue and green labeled subcomponents are complete. No. I think, we\u2019ve conceded here in recent calls that really doesn\u2019t seem to be working. I mean the consumer that really enjoys these types of items is looking for more of a basic meat , potato casserole type item, value is a very important element to this franchise and so as you kind of add more bills and vessels in cost to product that that doesn\u2019t seem to resonate well with the consumer. So we do believe we can get kind of go back to the basics and get this product line stabilized whether it\u2019s going to be a big growth catalyst for grocery products anymore. I mean at this point, I guess we\u2019re not seeing that, but we think between Mexican Foods, SKIPPY, and some of the other items grocery should be able to meet their growth objectives using those items, but I think your overall take is correct. My understanding know when it comes to single-serve meals that especially even if you look in the frozen segment which has also suffered. Even the health and wellness oriented items and frozen aren\u2019t doing all that well. So I do think it maybe a combination of \u2013 where consumers are looking for items, but also just kind of shear economic and who is getting hit the worst from that. Robert B. Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  That would make \u2013 I would agree with you that frozen isn't doing well either in that area. But I was focusing on your shelf-stable part of it because that\u2019s really where you play. Totally make sense. Thank you. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Thanks for taking the follow-up. The first one is for Jody. Can you talk a little bit about the corporate expense line item this quarter? It was significantly higher than the run rate that we've seen in the past. Does that include charges for the Cyto deal? Jody H. Feragen:  Not really those will get in our fourth quarter and we\u2019ll show up in the Specialty Foods segment lines. General corporate expenses really impacted this quarter by some employee related costs, as well as the write-off of a bad debt. Those will be the two biggest things, so we\u2019ll see the transaction cost in the next quarter. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  How much of that would be sort of one-time like the bad debt write-off seems unusual, right? I mean would you say first of all \u2013 sorry? Jody H. Feragen:  That was about $4 million. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Okay. Jody H. Feragen: It would hopefully be a one-time thing Akshay. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yes. And, just going back to the PED virus from my recollection and just talking to others in the industry I mean this quarter was the quarter where you expected the most impact on supply. It doesn\u2019t seem like it translated into any volume declines in Refrigerated Foods. Can you help us with how many hogs you process? I mean we\u2019re thinking the industry would see 6% to 7% lower hog supplies. Does that just not materialize or can you give us a sense of what\u2019s happening there with supply? Jody H. Feragen:  I think you can get a follow-up with Jana on the specifics with the industry numbers, but the amount of hogs being processed has increased week-over-week. The trouble is we\u2019re looking at some significant numbers from last year, so the year-over-year comparisons are still going to be down probably until the October timeframe. We \u2013 our team has just indicated, has done a super job of making sure that we have had the supply and we are now back up to normalized operations, a lot of the hog numbers that we\u2019re down were being offset by higher rates as well. So impact of the total industry isn\u2019t down as much as I think people originally anticipated, certainly helped by a summer that\u2019s been much cooler than normal and that allowed the hogs to put on the extra weight . Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Okay. and just one last one on the guidance range being as wide as it is, first, does it include these charges that you expect, or the Cyto deal, and if you can give us the order of magnitude that will be helpful and then just secondly, I mean you cited our margins that has been a main reason for your conservative approach there. What I can tell I mean margins so far have held pretty steady relative to the quarter you just reported. So is there something else that we should be thinking off when we are looking at that $0.10 range, which is unusual? Jody H. Feragen:  Okay. the first comment regarding the titles for the expenses, as we indicated on the call, when we announced the transactions, we would expect that any income from that operation would be \u2013 would offset the transaction costs. so those should be a net neutral in the Specialty Foods segment. Pork margins are being maintained at the levels that we saw in the third quarter to-date, but there has been a lot of volatility. the comparison that Jeff talked about was to fourth quarter last year, and they were unusually strong in our fourth quarter last year. so that year-over-year comparison for the fourth quarter won\u2019t be as beneficial to Refrigerated Foods as it was in the third quarter. Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.:  Okay, great. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) At this time, it appears there are no further questions in our queue. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Ettinger for any closing additional remarks. Jeffrey M. Ettinger:  Well, thank you. We are pleased to have achieved another record quarter, leveraging our balanced model to deliver consistent earnings growth. Our team will continue to deliver relevant, innovative and high-quality foods to meet the needs of our consumers and to drive long-term growth for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today. Operator :  As a reminder, this does conclude today\u2019s session. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation.",

Ettinger: Thank you, Jana, and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2014. Earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.63 per share, up 9% from a year ago, on sales of $2.5 billion, also a 9% increase. For the full year, the Company earned a record $2.23 per share, representing a 14% increase over last year. We also achieved record sales of $9.3 billion, an increase of 6%. I will now take you through each segment. In addition to discussing segment results, I will also provide an operating profit margin guidance range for each segment, which is our estimate of margin potential over the next few years given our current business structure, product mix and typical market volatility. Grocery Products segment profit was down 21% in the fourth quarter with sales down 3%. High meat input costs and related pricing actions hampered the growth of some of our brands, including Hormel chili and Hormel Compleats microwave meals. On the positive side, HORMEL bacon toppings, WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips and HERDEZ authentic Mexican foods grew during the quarter. For the year, segment profit was down 9% and sales were up 3%. We continue to support our iconic brands. This year we increased our Grocery Products' advertising spend by over 20%. At the end of September, we kicked off a national SKIPPY peanut butter advertising campaign after many years off air. Effective at the beginning of fiscal 2015, we will integrate Fresherized Foods, the maker of WHOLLY GUACAMOLE, into our sales and distribution systems to give this brand the full benefit of our consumer products sales force capabilities. Going forward, we will report 100% of the estimated $200 million in sales in our Grocery Products segment revenue. We will continue to report only 50% of the Fresherized Foods earnings, net of tax, in the equity and earnings line of the Grocery Products segment. Taking into account the addition of WHOLLY GUACAMOLE sales to our Grocery Products segment revenue, along with the similar integration of our other MegaMex Foods joint venture businesses in recent years, we expect Grocery Products segment operating margins to be within a range of 12% to 14% going forward. Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter operating profit increased 10%, with sales up 9%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up a robust 45% and sales increased 9%. Pork operating margins were a significant driver to the higher results this quarter. The Refrigerated Foods team showed impressive leadership by managing through especially volatile market conditions this past year and achieving excellent business results in the face of tight raw material supplies. Our Foodservice Group continues to deliver growth in our Refrigerated Foods segment with innovative solutions for Foodservice operators. These include products such as our HORMEL FIRE BRAISED meats and HORMEL Bacon 1 Fully Cooked Bacon, along with continued growth of HORMEL fully cooked sausages. On the retail side of the business, the reformulation and packaging updates of our HORMEL side dishes introduced just under a year ago have led to restored sales growth. HORMEL BLACK LABEL bacon and HORMEL party trays also delivered sales gains this quarter. Effective at the end of fiscal 2014, we dissolved our Precept Foods partnership by mutual decision with Cargill Meat Solutions. Sales of $115 million were associated with this business, but we do not anticipate a material impact to segment profit as a result of this change. Given our current product mix and taking commodity volatility risk into account, we expect Refrigerated Foods operating profit margins to be within a 5% to 8% range over the next few years. Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to build momentum delivering increased segment profit of 45% on a sales increase of 11% during the quarter. For the full year, operating profit was up 23% and sales increased 4%. Results at Jennie-O Turkey Store in the quarter were driven by continued growth in value-added sales, along with high commodity turkey prices. JENNIE-O lean ground turkey and JENNIE-O turkey bacon led sales growth this quarter. We increased our Jennie-O Turkey Store advertising spend this year with a Make The Switch campaign that started early in fiscal 2014, featuring ground turkey tacos. We plan to continue this advertising campaign in new U.S. markets early in fiscal 2015. We expect Jennie-O Turkey Store segment operating profit margin to be within the 13% to 17% range going forward. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit decrease of 14% and a sales increase of 31%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were down 4%. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed operating profit down 20% with sales down 3%. Full year sales excluding CytoSport were down 11%. We are pleased with our team's initial integration of the CytoSport business as we have started to leverage Hormel Foods strength in operating efficiencies, food, drug and mass marketing capabilities, and purchasing synergies to maximize the potential of this business. Excluding deal related costs and acquisition adjustments, CytoSport performed in line with our expectation this past quarter. We expect Specialty Foods segment operating profit margins to be within a range of 8% to 11% going forward. International & Other's fourth quarter operating profit increased 3%, with sales up 13%. Higher meat input costs pressured International segment margins during the quarter. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 19% and sales also increased by 19%. Our International team continues to do an excellent job expanding our business in China. To support that growth, we are announcing the construction of a new Refrigerated Foods plant in China, slated to open in the back half of fiscal 2016. This facility will produce pepperoni, bacon, ham and other refrigerated meat items sold in the foodservice and retail channels within China. Our expectation for International segment operating profit margins is a range of 14% to 17% over the next few years. From a total Company perspective, we anticipate operating profit margins in the 9% to 12% range, given our current business structure, product mix and typical market volatility. Moving into fiscal 2015, we expect to exceed our stated 5% sales and 10% earnings growth goals. We look for pork commodity prices and pork operating margins to normalize as the year progresses. We anticipate commodity pork prices will exhibit some volatility in fiscal 2015 with PEDV still lingering in domestic herds but not to the degree experienced in fiscal 2014. Lower meat protein prices will eventually provide input cost relief for our Grocery Products segment but will lead to challenging comparisons for our Refrigerated Foods segment. We plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2014 numbers. Lower corn prices should benefit Jennie-O Turkey Store throughout next year, offset to some degree by stubbornly high soymeal cost. We expect commodity turkey prices to normalize as fiscal 2015 progresses, down from the extremely high prices experienced in 2014. We plan to increase turkey production modestly in fiscal 2015 to support our value-added businesses, on the heels of no increase to our production level last year. In our Specialty Foods segment, we continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver earnings accretion of $0.05 per share in 2015, as disclosed in our acquisition call earlier this summer. We look for our China business, along with our exports of SKIPPY peanut butter and pork products, to drive growth in the International segment in fiscal 2015. We will continue building our brands in 2015 with a double-digit increase in our advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign, REV snack wraps, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter and MUSCLE MILK protein rich products. Late yesterday we informed our team that we will cease operations at our Grocery Products manufacturing facility in Stockton, California effective the end of February 2015. This was a difficult decision but a necessary step given available capacity and other more modern dry grocery facilities in the Company. We are also considering a potential exit from operations in Vietnam early in fiscal 2015, which have been part of a larger joint venture in the region. This business which includes hog production, feed mill and a processed meats facility, all located in Vietnam, has not delivered the results we expect from our international investments. As a result of the closure of the Stockton facility and the potential exit from the Vietnam business, we expect nonrecurring expenses of $0.04 to $0.06 per share to impact our profits in the first half of fiscal 2015. We are providing details about these anticipated nonrecurring items to allow better visibility of our long-term operating performance expectation. After taking all of these significant factors into account, we have established our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance range at $2.45 to $2.55 per share, excluding the expected nonrecurring charges. Our balanced model continues to benefit our performance, as evidenced by our track record of increased earnings in 27 of the last 30 years. We believe our strong brands in niche categories and our focus on innovation position us to continue to drive superior growth and shareholder value. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014. Jody H. Feragen: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for fiscal 2014 fourth quarter totaled $171.3 million or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $157.3 million or $0.58 per share a year ago. Net earnings for the 12 months of fiscal 2014 totaled $602.7 million or $2.23 per share, compared to net earnings of $526.2 million or $1.95 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion last year, a 9% increase. For the full year, dollar sales were $9.3 billion, a 6% increase from last year. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.34 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2013. For the full year, volume was 5 billion pounds, up 1% over last year. When we announced the acquisition of CytoSport, we indicated that the acquisition would have a neutral impact on fiscal 2014 earnings, net of transaction costs. Besides the expected transaction costs of $4.8 million, we incurred the fair value inventory adjustment of $4.5 million, which negatively impacted the results of our Specialty Foods segment. The inventory adjustment was not included in our original guidance. As previously stated, we expect CytoSport to contribute approximately $0.05 per share to our fiscal 2015 results. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 6.5% of sales, compared to 6.3% last year. For the full year, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales for fiscal 2015. The growth over fiscal 2014 will come as a result of plans for the increased advertising Jeff alluded to, including the marketing associated with CytoSport. Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $22.4 million compared to $16.6 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment and the national advertising campaign for HORMEL REV Wraps. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $5.7 million in the fourth quarter versus $2.1 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture. Interest and investment income was $0.8 million for the fourth quarter compared to $2.5 million last year. Year-to-date interest and investment income was $3.2 million compared to $5 million the year ago. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.4 million compared to $3.1 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $12.7 million, up from $12.5 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $12 million to $14 million for fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 34.1% versus 33.9% in fiscal 2013. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 34.3% compared to 33.6% last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 34.5%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 263.6 million and 263.8 million shares respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 269.8 million and 270.2 million shares respectively. We repurchased 666,000 shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, spending $30.9 million. For the full year, we spent $58.9 million purchasing 1.3 million shares. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. During the fourth quarter, we repaid our line of credit used to fund the CytoSport acquisition. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million, compared to $38 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $159.1 million compared with $106.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $180 million to $200 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.9 million, compared to $31.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $130 million compared to $125 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015. We announced a $0.20 per share increase to the annual dividend, making the new dividend $1. This represents a 25% increase, after an 18% increase last year and marks the 49th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] I will go first to Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Ken Zaslow : Can we just talk about the guidance for a second? I was just surprised by the muted tone of it. I guess when I think about it, if I strip out the CytoSport and I strip out some of the weather and issues that you happened to have last year, which I thought was going to recur, it seems like the internal growth is about mid-single digits. First of all I guess my question is, did I do my math right, and then second, does that strike you as the right balance, are you conservative on that, how do you think about that in terms of the internal growth, that's how I look at it? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Let me walk you through our thinking in terms of the guidance range that we've established for 2015. Starting with Refrigerated Foods, as we talked about earlier in the call, we do expect processing margins to not be as favorable as they were in 2014. Notwithstanding this, Refrigerated Foods we would expect to still grow modestly due to their value-added sales momentum in foodservice and with their retail brands and due to improved general efficiency, but it will be fairly modest growth in 2015 at a segment profit operating level. This more favorable cost environment should help Grocery Products, so we do expect Grocery Products to rebound to more normal growth rates, plus the fact that they will no longer have the earn-out as part of Fresherized Foods in their costs. The favorable cost will also help International. We expect International to achieve its fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth. For both Grocery Products and International, there are certain lingering high costs in the inventory that will continue to sort of dampen their results in their opening quarter of the year, but as the year goes on we'll be working through that inventory. Clearly Jennie-O Turkey Store, our expectation is to have another good year. They are in a more favorable grain environment, plus they have great value-added momentum, and this should move them towards the top of the operating profit range that we just articulated. That being said, there are some mitigating factors for Jennie-O Turkey Store. The grain benefit is partially offset by hedges. We've talked before about our hedge philosophy. The soymeal side of the grain formulas has remained stubbornly high. And we do have certain grain based contracts with foodservice customers within that segment. Secondly, we expect the turkey commodity meat markets, which have been at an all-time high, to not be quite as favorable in 2015. And then third, we have approved an enhanced advertising budget for Jennie-O Turkey Store, the Make The Switch campaign has driven good results, and so we're going to be investing further there. In fact, overall advertising spending, as we talked about, was up double digits in 2014 for the whole Company and should be again in 2015. For Specialty Foods, by the fourth quarter that the unit had recovered from the year-over-year SPLENDA change in business operations, their results were actually up modestly in Q4, if you don't count CytoSport at all. And so we expect again modest growth of the overall Specialty portfolio in 2015, plus they should attain the $0.05 a share benefit from the acquisition of CytoSport. So for us, this adds up to a range of $2.45 to $2.55, exclusive of the nonrecurring events. The midpoint of this range is a 12% increase over the year we just completed, on top of the 14% increase we generated in 2014. So that's our thinking at least in terms of providing this kind of guidance range. Ken Zaslow : That's great. And then just a follow-up, is the cost savings, is there a greater initiative at Hormel to focus on cost savings? I know obviously one facility you're closing down, you're thinking about the Vietnam, is there something that you're doing more broadly that we should be thinking about, maybe internal actions, and does it have to do with the retail environment, or these are just one-offs that I shouldn't read anything into it? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I guess I wouldn't read anything into it. I mean the timing on those types of decisions, I mean we've had the investment with our partner in Southeast Asia in the Vietnam operations for several years, and kind of given that we think a good try there but really feel we'd be better off focusing our attention elsewhere. In terms of the Stockton plant decision, I mean it's an older facility. We really had to kind of make a determination, do we pour more money into that facility or could we utilize the capacities we have available in more modern grocery facilities elsewhere in the U.S., and so we made that difficult decision for that reason. Ken Zaslow : Great, I appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc. Farha Aslam : I noticed you had a considerable step-up in your CapEx expectations for 2015. Is there something incremental that you're investing in for next year? Jody H. Feragen: Sure, Farha, this is Jody. Jeff talked about the new SPAM production facility that we're going to be \u2013 Refrigerated Foods production facility that we are building in China. So a portion of that plant will impact 2015. We had started the construction of additional SPAM lines domestically that will flow over into 2015 as well. And then we have several other initiatives that we're looking at to expand capacities for some of our product lines that are running at tighter capacities. So, yes, it is a step-up and then we have just the general repair and maintenance type CapEx that comes with operating many facilities across the country. Farha Aslam : Right. And then in terms of capital allocation overall, it looks like you have a net debt-free balance sheet. Could you share with us your uses of cash and kind of your priorities in terms of how you look to deploy that capital going into next year? Jody H. Feragen: We certainly took a good step forward with the 25% increase in the dividend that we made this year. So that's obviously something, a legacy that we are extremely proud of and would look to continue to do that going forward. We've made several acquisitions, SKIPPY in 2013 and then more recently the CytoSport acquisition in 2014. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there that fit with our strategies of brands that are number one or number two in the marketplace, transactions that can be accretive both from a margin perspective as well as overall profit, certainly looking for things that provide us the global footprint, and then more recently trying to look at things that fit more into a health and wellness type portfolio appealing to younger consumers addressing the snack area as well as our ability to add innovation to anything that we would purchase. Farha Aslam : And then share repurchase? Jody H. Feragen: You know that's probably a little more opportunistic. We did do some this year and I would expect that we'll take a look at doing that a little bit in 2015 as well. Farha Aslam : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Larson with Janney Capital Markets. Eric Larson : Thank you and happy Thanksgiving to everybody. I'd like to drill down just a little bit more on the cut-out margin. I think it's reasonable to assume that the cut-out margin would normalize a little bit more next year, but demand has remained I think a lot stronger than what we would have all expected. Now I think there can be a lot more competition from chicken next year as well, but can you \u2013 exports for pork have been particularly strong, can you try to put some of the demand context into that how you're looking at that cut-out margin? Jody H. Feragen: Sure, I'll give the wheel here. We certainly have seen some volatility in those operating margins in the first part of our fiscal year in November here, so they've been a little bit all over the board, certainly lower than they were last year at this time from that perspective. We do expect to see hog numbers increase 3% to 3.5%, we're not taking our harvest up that high, but that should provide lots of availability. The demand seems to be the equation that we'll see what happens with that. We would expect the cut-outs to come off the historical highs that they have been and we've seen some of that come already. So our balance is that they're going to go back more to a normalized range, maybe not as low as the five-year average, and that's what we've used in our assumptions. Eric Larson : Okay, alright. And then just one follow-up question on Jennie-O, obviously your ad campaigns have been very successful for your value-added products and you're going to bump up your advertising next year. Is part of that reflecting the fact that you might have easier fuel comps and fuel comparisons this upcoming winter, I mean Lord knows what that will be, but is part of the thinking that you'll just reinvest some of the positive variance in some of your operating costs in that division? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I mean we do pulse the advertising somewhat based on macro conditions, but clearly the Jennie-O brand has benefited from being on-air and from emphasizing this sort of Make The Switch theme, and the most recent version has been the taco campaign, but we had a burger campaign and a bacon campaign in prior years as well. Their plans right now are to kind of roll into some new markets with that advertising to support some product placements that we've been able to attain through our sales organization. And so, we'll definitely be on-air early in the year and we may complement that with more of a fall campaign as well. Eric Larson : Okay, thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I want to spend a little time in Grocery, if we could, and talk about the volume outlook there. I think they were down 5% in the quarter and it's been really challenged for most of the year, and help us think about some of the product categories, I know there's been a big focus on Compleats over the course of the year to right that, but maybe a bit of context in terms of the categories where that have struggled this year and some of the actions that you're taking or anticipating can drive an improvement in 2015? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I mean on the positive side, as we talked about, I mean bacon business had a fantastic year. We have two brands within the Mexican portfolio that are really on a roll in terms of double-digit growth, the HERDEZ brand and WHOLLY, and now the WHOLLY sales in 2014 were not being reflected in our results. So that would have changed the year-over-year results had we had those in there, and starting in 2015 we will have that. Our franchises, our iconic brands of SPAM and SKIPPY, had fairly flat Q4 results but both have what we hope are good solid marketing campaigns going forward and we expect growth out of both of those brands in 2015. The areas where we have struggled a little bit more have been some of the other traditional canned meat items, the Dinty Moore and the Hormel chilli items. And then we kind of continue to have coming up and down experience with our microwave meals, we are going to market with a little bit different tactics within that category in terms of tiered pricing and new offerings and we'll see if that works. That's our game-plan going into 2015. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that's helpful. Maybe that rolls into my follow-up on the 5% plus sales growth target, I would imagine in spite of 3% growth from CytoSport, if that layers in, I think you're consolidating some different parts of the business that you haven't in the past, but I would imagine that the commodity price environment in pork and refrigerated as well as in turkey would be a little bit of a headwind, and so I guess I'm surprised that \u2013 am I thinking about it right that the 5% is really about acquisitions and some of the kind of consolidating different businesses as opposed to underlying with offsetting price declines and more flattish volume environment across the portfolio? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Pricing is always a wildcard. I mean our long-term revenue goal is a 5% goal. We actually expect to exceed that here in 2015, in part because of the WHOLLY brand coming onto Grocery sales. And so in general, I mean if you look at our long-term track record, we have actually exceeded the 5% over the last five years, but that is definitely with some assistance from acquisitions such as SKIPPY and the MUSCLE MILK acquisition. So in general, clearly when I look at the grocery store environment, I think our perimeter based items, we do expect to be able to grow at that kind of a 5% clip. Center of the store, maybe not quite that robust, but we have had investments in acquisitions such as SKIPPY that have added to that portfolio and we think Mexican can definitely grow at that pace. Our Foodservice Group has done a nice job with that as well. So our target kind of not counting acquisitions is certainly in the 3% to 4% range, and then we've been able to round that up by virtue of finding the right prospects periodically. Adam Samuelson : Alright, that's very helpful. I'll pass it along. Operator : We'll go next to Diane Geissler with CLSA. Diane Geissler : I wanted to ask you about the normalized ranges that you provided this morning. It looks as if you've taken down the Grocery Products normalized margin by about 200 basis points, but you've improved your JOTS margin by 200 basis points. So my question is really in the Grocery Products segment, how much of the margin reduction is due to the fact that you'll be rolling in sort of 100% of the Fresherized Foods and what percentage is just due to your ongoing outlook for whatever tighter protein markets which impacts that margin or slower growth coming from the center of the store, is there any way to quantify for us what's going on with your outlook on the Grocery Products margins? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I can tell you for 2015, our expectation is that the net margin will be kind of equivalent to what you saw in 2014. So what you have there is the watering down effect of a lot of the Fresherized sales coming in with only half margin being reported, but an expected improvement in terms of \u2013 we said we had some very difficult operating cost challenges during 2014 and we don't expect those to recur. So altogether, those two factors should cancel each other out. I guess I would also point out that if you take away MegaMex, so I mean you've got a great growing business with great consumer franchises but franchises that were accounting 100% of the sales and only half of the earnings and the after-tax of that in some cases, the core Grocery Products portfolio not counting MegaMex is still, we still look to be in the high teens in terms of their operating delivery. So we really don't feel we've seen a denigration in the portfolio, we just are seeing the impact of MegaMex rolling through there in terms of that range we just provided. Jody H. Feragen: And I would add that MegaMex generally is growing at a little faster clip than our corp portfolio is. Diane Geissler : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. And then I wanted to ask about the new plant in China. I think you said, peanut, bacon, ham, pepperoni, whatever, I'm assuming that's going to be under a branded, like Hormel brand, and I guess if you could just few more details about what your strategy will be in China, do you expect to open retail outlets, do you have partners there who will be providing the sourcing materials, I mean can you just give us a little bit more clarity on what your plans are when that plant opens in 2016? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Sure. So right now we have three plants in China. One of them is a SKIPPY peanut butter plant, exclusively for that production, and so that one we won't count that right now but our team definitely operates that in terms of the G&A efficiencies of the total operation and it's a great sales vehicle for us in that and other markets. We then have two other facilities that we've operated for more than a dozen years, one in Beijing and one in Shanghai, that produce these similar refrigerated based items. Our team has done a very nice job growing that business over time, I mean that's many times a 20% plus growth trajectory, and so as we project forward with the kind of business we have, we needed new plant capacity and so the team has been working on identifying kind of where that should be and how that would roll together. And so that production in terms of the sourcing for the last several years, we buy meat from approved suppliers within the Chinese market, we don't raise hogs ourselves and we're not a basic slaughter in that market, but we're confident that we have sufficient meat suppliers to meet these growth needs that will go ultimately into that new plant. Operator : We'll go next to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Mario Contreras : You had mentioned PEDV briefly. I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more of your thoughts on what you've seen so far now that we're getting into the kind of early months of the core winter weather, and then how do you anticipate potential impact on profitability if prevalence is greater or less than maybe what you're expecting? Jody H. Feragen: This is Jody. That certainly could be a wildcard. What we have seen in the industry is, it slowed down during the summer months as one would expect, as the weather seems to be more conducive in the winter when it's cold and damp, but we've also seen a lot of the producers really increase their bio security and I think that will have a positive impact on any further spread of the disease. So our assumption is that hog production should grow in the 3% to 3.5% for the industry as a whole and that assumes that there is a lot less impact than there was last year on PED. Mario Contreras : Okay. And then one additional question, if I could, on the International segment, I believe you had indicated your volume was up 6%, but if I back out the benefit from SKIPPY China and CytoSport, is it fair to say that core volume was down, am I thinking about that right for that business? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I wouldn't want to do the math on the fly. I mean certainly it was flattish. It wasn't the best quarter either for SPAM in terms of we had high inputs and then some cases then had some deferred shipments to some of our export markets, and we had an uneven quarter in terms of SKIPPY, we have a couple of markets where it's going great but a couple of others where it receded somewhat. But overall, I mean they saw a double-digit growth on a full year basis for International last year and we expect a strong growth heading into 2015. Mario Contreras : Okay, so I guess it sounds like maybe you view that as more of sort of a one-off weak quarter with some timing issues but strong when we look into 2015? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Yes, with the other caveat that I mentioned earlier that from a margin standpoint International still will be kind of \u2013 SPAM is a major product line for example on the inventory carrying cost that they have from the spike in raw materials this summer will still impact them certainly through Q1, but after that they should be in better condition. Mario Contreras : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc. Akshay S. Jagdale: Good morning and happy Thanksgiving. So first question is on SG&A, you mentioned you expect an increase next year. Can you address where you ended up this year? I believe came in a little bit less than what you were expecting. So is part of next year's increase a timing shift and if you can just give us a sense as to why this year's SG&A to sales came in lower than what you were expecting? That's my first question. Jody H. Feragen: So, part of the driver for 2014 SG&A being somewhat lower was the timing of some compensation accruals we had last year but we didn't have this year. As far as 2015, the majority of that increase is really being driven by the increased advertising campaigns. Akshay S. Jagdale: Okay. And then with your long-term guidance on margins, very helpful, what timeframe should we be thinking of that margin outlook to be? And you've made a lot of portfolio changes, Jeff, so in general where are your portfolios today versus where it was five years ago? I mean do you feel generally better about expanding margins longer-term as a whole or you feel better about the growth prospects, organic growth prospects of this portfolio? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I guess we're probably putting these ranges out as reasonable over the next three to four years. I mean things can change, both in macro conditions and in our businesses, so we would want to keep an eye on those and update those as those things make modifications. In terms of your other question, I mean we certainly hope we've improved the portfolio over time, that's been the goal. I think it depends on which segment we're talking about as to whether the expansion of margins versus growth is the bigger area of emphasis. So clearly within Refrigerated Foods, that team understands very clearly that their mission is to expand margins. They had a very nice year this year in terms of moving upward and expect to hold that in 2015 and grow from there. In other areas such as Jennie-O Turkey Store or International, I think those are excellent growth opportunities. So the bigger those two pieces can become of our overall portfolio, the better off we'll be in the aggregate. When we announced the CytoSport acquisition, we conceded that at least on an onboarding basis, it was kind of even with Specialty Foods' margins, but we do think that as we get our hands around that business and drive efficiency and growth going forward that that can start migrating those margins up, and so that was why that range has an upside to it that's above where they are at today. So it kind of depends on the area of the business. Akshay S. Jagdale: That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert B. Moskow: Just a few kind of odds and ends questions. On Jennie-O, you said that you expected commodity turkey prices to be a little lower. Can you give me some of the drivers behind that? I thought supplies have been tightened quite a bit. Do you expect supplies to increase? Secondly, I think your competitor in peanut butter is taking a price cut. Are you going to do the same? And then lastly, I'm planning to visit your offices in January, any wardrobe recommendations for visiting Minnesota in January? Jody H. Feragen: Boots and a long coat. Robert B. Moskow: Alright, thank you for that. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: [Once you reach] [ph], we'll have you well taken care of. The roads are a different story. Robert B. Moskow: No golf outing this year in January? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: We'll find you a simulator somewhere. I don't know, that would be a [better idea] [ph]. So let's start with Jennie-O. We have seen increases in egg sets and poult placements recently. We had a flat year in 2014 in terms of total pounds brought into the system, yet our value-added businesses keep growing, and so we will be increasing our supplies somewhat going forward. The market also seemed like it kind of got an early jump last year when a number of entities had issues with propane and winter weather and so forth and the meat supplies tightened quite a bit. So we are expecting a more normal situation there. We have taken steps to get our hands on more of the propane ourselves so that we're not quite as much at mercy of the marketplace for that, and I don't know what others have done. But overall, I mean they were at very high levels this year and our best outlook is that it will still be strong levels next year but not at what we've benefited from this year. In terms of the peanut butter equation, going into this fall and going into our fiscal year for 2015, we had not been looking at taking further price decreases. The crops certainly have been more favorable lately and there was an overall decline in costs, but relatively speaking that decline has not accelerated in recent months, it pretty much was already priced into the crop. But when the leading share player made their announcement as to their strategy going forward, we huddled our group and really thought about, okay, what's our reaction going to be to this? We're still pretty early on in the ownership of this brand, we recognize that we're at kind of almost a 2-to-1 deficit when you look at market share in the U.S., and so we thought \u2013 and we're not really asserting that SKIPPY is a premium peanut butter product, it's a mainstream product, and so our assessment was, when the market leader has modified the price and that we want to in essence stay competitive with that price, and so we will be executing a price decrease in the marketplace. We think that this should allow fewer promotional dollars to be spent in the category because the bases are lower, so the feature that needs to come off with that doesn't need to be as deep, and so that will be our execution strategy going forward. Robert B. Moskow: Got it. So [indiscernible], yes, but the price cut, so that didn't really affect your profit outlook for fiscal 2015 for SKIPPY, you think that the promo adjustment will kind of balance it out? Jeffrey M. Ettinger: I guess I don't want to give you a one line item like that. I mean in the aggregate of our Grocery, what we expect for Grocery Products, what we're spending our ad dollars on, et cetera, we're comfortable with the returns that SKIPPY will deliver in terms of the overall growth we're expecting for grocery in fiscal 2015. Robert B. Moskow: Yes, okay. Alright, have a great holiday. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Jeffrey M. Ettinger: Okay, we will conclude our call. I am pleased with the opportunity to announce another record performance this year. This has been the result of the hard work and dedication of the really talented team here at Hormel Foods and we're looking forward to an even stronger fiscal 2015. So on behalf of our team, I want to wish you all happy Thanksgiving and thank you for joining us today on the call. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We're off to an excellent start to our fiscal year with adjusted net earnings up 22% from a year ago, on record first-quarter sales of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase over last year. In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods delivered a 19% increase in operating profit on a 1% sales increase. Our food service group achieved strong sales of branded items such as HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, HORMEL pizza toppings and MENUMASTER hams. Meat products grew retail sales of HORMEL GATHERINGS Party Trays, HORMEL pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice lunch meat. In addition to this value-added product growth, lower than anticipated hog prices were a nice tailwind for the segment during this quarter. The combination of lower feed cost, a more mild winter and a fairly quick rebound from the PED virus that plagued the industry over the past year is resulting in an increasing domestic hog supply. Pork remained an excellent relative value to consumers, and we continue to see solid demand from our customers. While we drove growth in our value-added Refrigerated Foods businesses, our overall sales increase was only 1% and volume was down 3%. We reduced harvest levels by 2% compared to last year, as certain market conditions did not support volume increases for much of the quarter. Also, as we announced on our last call, we dissolved our Precept Foods joint venture, which resulted in lower sales and volumes this quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered impressive growth this quarter, exceeding our expectations with segment profit up 56% and sales up 10% compared to last year. Results were driven by value-added sales and excellent execution throughout the segment, along with favorable commodity turkey prices and lower feed cost. Jennie-O lean ground turkey, rotisserie turkey and premium seasoned deli turkey led sales growth this quarter. We continue to support and build the Jennie-O brand though our Make the Switch media campaign which began running in new U.S. markets in January. Grocery Products adjusted segment profit decreased 8% this quarter, with sales up 2%. High meat input costs and varied pricing actions in key categories hampered the growth of some of our brands. Products including SKIPPY peanut butter and Hormel chili were down this quarter. On the positive side, our SPAM family of products, Wholly Guacamole dips and Herdez salsas and sauces grew nicely during the quarter. Grocery Products is dedicated to strengthening our brand through advertising and merchandising support with campaigns running in the first half of the year for SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel chili, and Hormel Compleats microwave meals. Out Specialty Foods segment reported an operated profit decrease of 13% and a sales increase of 34%. Excluding sales of CytoSport products, sales were up 3%. The lower operating profit was primarily driven by reduced contract manufacturing business during the quarter, which offset the incremental CytoSport results. Specialty Foods achieved solid distribution gains from Muscle Milk protein nutrition products in the food, drug and mass channel over the past quarter. International & Other adjusted segment profit increased 6%, with solid increases from both our retail and food service businesses in China, offset in part by lower results from SPAM exports due to high input costs and transportation challenges. First quarter sales for International were up 17%, benefiting from strong growth in China, increased SKIPPY peanut butter sales, and the addition of the SKIPPY China business. Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal, we believe hog and grain costs will remain favorable. We expect the high turkey commodity prices, which have been beneficial over the last several months, to trend down as the year progresses. We anticipate sales of our value-added products in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store will remain strong throughout the year. Lower meat prices will provide input cost relief for some of our Grocery Products categories after we work through higher-cost inventories. Specialty Foods will maintain its focus on maximizing CytoSport synergies, gaining distribution, igniting innovation and building the Muscle Milk brand to drive segment growth. We continue to expect the CytoSport business to deliver the $0.05 per share earnings accretion we have previously guided. We look for Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments to contribute to our growth goals in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect International to build on its growth trajectory in China with some challenges to its export business over the next few months, offsetting a portion of that growth. Due to our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our fiscal 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range, excluding the non-recurring charges, from $2.45 to $2.55 per share up to $2.50 to $2.60 per-share. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the first quarter. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. On a GAAP basis net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $171.7 million, up 12% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.64, a 12% increase. Excluding non-recurring charges, non-GAAP adjusted net earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.3 million, up 22% from net earnings of $153.3 million last year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.69, up 21% compared to $0.57 per share a year ago. The first quarter included pre-tax non-recurring charges of $10.5 million related to the Stockton, California, plant closure and $9.5 million for the exit of international joint venture businesses. Sales for the first quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the same period last year, a 7% increase. Volume for the first quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, up 3% from fiscal 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 7.5% of sales compared to 7.4% for the same period last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales for fiscal 2015. Advertising expenses for the first quarter were $42.2 million compared to $36.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year was primarily associated with advertising for CytoSport products in the Specialty Foods segment. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $1.7 million in the first quarter versus $4.7 million last year. Charges associated with the exit of international joint venture businesses totaling $9.5 million offset improved performance from our MegaMex Foods joint venture. Interest and investment income was $1.1 million for the first quarter compared to $1.2 million last year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 34.7% versus 34.4% in fiscal 2014. We expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35% for fiscal year 2015. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 263.7 million shares. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the first quarter was 270.1 million shares. We did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. We have 8.2 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Total debt at the end of the quarter was unchanged at $250 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.7 million compared to $37 million last year. For fiscal 2015 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million to $190 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.8 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Steve? Operator : Our first question is from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. This is Jason filling in for Adam. First off, congratulations on the great quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jason. Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I was hoping you could talk a bit about whether 1Q is in line with your internal expectations. I guess I'm curious on whether the guidance increase was more a function of the 1Q beat or kind of a stronger-than-expected remainder of the year. And if the latter, can you talk a bit about what's changed from your original outlook given lower pork prices and higher commodity chicken? Thanks. Or on turkey? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Yes, really the guidance range increase is pretty much recognizing the beat for the first quarter. As we look at the remainder of the year, we had a robust growth plan already submitted for the year. We're still confident that we should be able to deliver against that plan. There are things that are trending more strongly and there are things that are more challenging, but all in we're comfortable that this new range reflects our best estimate of where we think the year should turn out. Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Farha Aslam from Stephens, Inc. Your line is open. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Good morning. Could you update us on your two acquisitions, the Hormel acquisition of SKIPPY as well as CytoSport? Are they performing in line with your expectations? Or do you think CytoSport's going to deliver that $0.05 accretion that you anticipated given that you're spending pretty heavily in the first quarter against that? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. SKIPPY has been a wonderful acquisition for the company. Even this current quarter where we experienced some down sales in the grocery part of it, the domestic U.S. part, we really feel that's a short-term reaction to kind of the pricing activity going on within the category and we're still very, very bullish on the item long-term. We've done a good job of gaining new distribution. We have our new ad campaign that we have confidence in going forward. We are looking to create innovative products, the first of which are the SKIPPY Singles items out in the marketplace. And even this quarter SKIPPY on a international basis enjoyed very good results and we're pleased with where that's heading. CytoSport is also off to a good start. A lot of activity has gone on in these first few months of ownership. We've already seen some really significant sales achievements within the food, drug and mass channel that we frankly kind of knew that Hormel would be an advantage for us bringing that skill set to that brand. And we continue to bolster efforts in some of the other channels as well, the club and specialty channels. The team is hard at work at creating the right cost structure for that overall business. We're now running that business on a collaborative or combined basis with our previous Century Foods organization. That was a custom manufacturer within the sports nutrition world. And so we're definitely confident in the $0.05 accretion that we've called out for that business going forward. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. And then, as a follow-up, there's two businesses up for sale in the protein area. Can you just comment generally what you think about valuations and transactions in the food and protein space right now and Hormel's interest in M&A? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Well, Farha, I'm not sure what two transactions you're talking about and we wouldn't comment on any specific businesses that are available. But still go back to the things that we're looking for in acquisitions and really to meet the platforms of global, certainly things that have an international component are very attractive. We've done some nice work in the snacking and on-the-go business. So meeting things that meet that criteria, better-for-you as well as things that can add accretion to our existing margin structure. We like number one and number two brands. And certainly anything that adds a component where we can bring some innovation is obviously attractive to us. So we continue to evaluate opportunities. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I just have two questions. One is on grocery, what are the prospects for the top line growth in that business? I know it struggled a little bit, but on the flipside is what are the key inputs that have broken your way in terms of \u2013 and what's the timing to which you're going to be able to realize some of those breaks in the input prices? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. On the top line side, we enjoyed really an excellent quarter on the MegaMex franchise, particularly the Herdez and Wholly brands and so those definitely should be superior delivery vehicles for Grocery Products going forward. Our expectation is that SKIPPY is going to be a solid growth contributor for our company and it has been every quarter that we've owned it, except for this one. And so we need to get through this price decrease activity that occurred during the quarter and move on and restore our growth there. We continue to enjoy growth with our SPAM product line, have good consumer marketing against that line and continue to add flavors. So overall, we're encouraged that Grocery Products should be able to deliver growth within its segment. On the input or more cost oriented side, I mean we were talking about probably the second half of the year is where we really expect Grocery Products to start showing significant year-over-year growth. That will come in part we think from the top line benefit of the ad campaigns that we referenced in our earlier comments. We're in a better raw material cost picture. When you look at churn (18:54) costs, for example, they're much more favorable right now than they were a year ago. And we're still working through some old inventory before we can fully reflect those, but that definitely will be a help. We should be in a better position in terms of our production resources following the closure of the Stockton plant and moving a couple of those lines as well as some new lines of production at Dubuque that we previously announced. So those are all reasons why we're bullish on the second half for Grocery Products on the input side. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): You expect to have volumes up in the back half of the year. Is that fair? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And then just, I guess, follow-up is, can you just talk about what is the impact of the West Coast port issues? Have you had any major impact? Did you foresee it? Do you think it's going to get resolved? Is it one-time in nature? Any sort of color on that. I know it's a loaded question, but just curious on that. Thanks. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean compared to a lot of companies, we're probably not as exposed, but we still do care about our International business and it's certainly a pain to have some of our important branded products being held up and not being able to deliver them to our customers in the marketplace. We're as hopeful as anyone that the thing will get resolved, but I don't know that I have any better perspective than anyone reading the paper can provide as to how likely that is to happen, but we're a little hand to mouth with some of our inventories right now in terms of shipping overseas, but in terms of total impact to the business, it has not been meaningful. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Eric Larson from Janney Capital. Your line is open. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Two questions. Margins in the turkey segment were obviously off the charts this quarter. Can you give us a little bit of help? I know that a year ago in the extremely cold weather that we had we just had crazy fuel costs, mainly in propane and even shortages. They were even hard to get it. Could you give \u2013 possibly quantify the potential year-over-year benefit you received Q1 from that? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I can't put a price tag on that, Eric, but in terms of the trend, you're absolutely right. I mean not only was propane short, it was very expensive. So the market for the product is much better this year. On top of that we basically operate in Minnesota and Wisconsin. That's where all our turkey barns are. It has been relatively speaking a more mild winter here, so in terms of propane usage it's not been as significant. So those are both definitely benefits that have been part of what you described as sort of the off-the-chart performance by Jennie-O, coupled with commodity meat markets that have remained higher than we had thought they would, although they certainly are starting to trend back to a more normal level. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yes, obviously your commodity meat markets are going to have a much bigger impact. The next question is probably for Jody. Jody, in the quarter your year-over-year corporate expense line was down sharply. Was there a one-time issue in last year's number or was there a one-time positive issue this year or how should we look at corporate expense? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : So I would say there were one-time positive issues this quarter. We had some miscellaneous sale of assets as well as some sales on (22:38) use tax refunds and that would get parked in that corporate line. So I would guess that last year is more representative of a going forward rate. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Diane. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Good morning. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey, I wanted to ask about your comments about the food service strength in the Refrigerated Foods group. Could you talk a little bit more about that? I think we've seen some improvement in comp trends recently in the restaurant space. So maybe your forecast and what you're hearing from your customer base that would be helpful? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Yes, we definitely have heard more positive commentary in terms of the general outlook for the marketplace. The lower gas prices seems to kind of play itself out fairly quickly within that segment in terms of traffic builds. We obviously hope and I think we've delivered over time performance over the trend line for the overall business. And I guess I would attribute that to some of the innovative new products that the team's come out with, including the BACON 1 that we're having good success with right away this year. And then also their focused approach on certain of the business segments, some of the non-commercial areas such as colleges and universities and healthcare that they've really been able to create new items for and really create some excellent relationships and service that again hopefully allow them to perform above that market trend. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up on Eric's question actually on the JOTS margins. So obviously very strong this quarter, but you did indicate that you felt that commodity prices would begin to soften as we move through the year. Can you just tell me what your expectations are for the margin structure in JOTS in the back half of the year, comparing your expectations on the commodity side versus what I think will still be beneficial raising cost year-on-year, not only the roll-through of the inventory in terms of the propane and terrible weather last year, et cetera, but also lower grain prices? I guess what I'm asking is when you look at the second half of the year, do you expect your JOTS margins to be above your normalized range or do you think the pricing dynamic will bring JOTS margins back into a normalized range? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We did provide heading into the year a new sense of what we thought was a normalized range of 13% to 17% and certainly acknowledge this quarter exceeded that. Now all the ranges we provided were annualized ranges. Jennie-O has historically had stronger profit delivery in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and then as you get into the summer months the cost picture is a little more challenging typically and some of the demand changes. So it's hard to give you a quarter-by-quarter sense of that. I mean for the full year, we certainly expect Jennie-O will come in nearer to the top of the range than in the middle and they definitely still should enjoy the benefits on the grain side, but we expect less benefit in terms of the commodity meat performance. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Greetings from sunny Florida. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It's only two degrees up here, so... Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Oh, don't make me jealous. Don't make me jealous. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's my line. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. But I think it's very rare that we get to see 9% volume growth in a meat business and you're seeing it in Jennie-O, and is it really a function of greater demand for value-added products that you're selling? Is it new customers that you brought along or is there a commodity element in that 9% as well? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, there is some commodity element, but we did enjoy solid high-single-digit growth really throughout the value-added pieces of Jennie-O. The most heralded part of the brand would be the retail products that we're enjoying excellent success on ground turkey, sold both in tray pack and chub forms that are being supported by the ad campaign, but also a nice quarter from the deli group, rotisserie and some other premium seasoned items. Food service also had a good quarter. So I think we do look at it as we've been able to spur greater demand for the value-added products. The consumers that have found the Jennie-O Turkey Store brand are trying more items and enjoying it more often. And while we've enjoyed really great growth, not just this year but over a number of years, when you look at overall household penetration, it's still very low. And so we think we've got all sorts of room to go. The trend toward health and wellness is certainly a tailwind that Jennie-O takes advantage of. And so I think we're well positioned to continue to grow this item. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So, when you say that the commodity benefits in turkey aren't going to stick around forever, are you also referring to that top-line number or are you just referring to the pricing in turkey has to fall due to \u2013 I don't know \u2013 increased supplies or something? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, our focus at Jennie-O is clearly trying to have a supply chain that delivers against the value-added portfolio. Although we've done a great job of creating items that utilizes dark meat portion of the turkey, the reality is, as with most companies, there is an element of that product line that ultimately ends up being exported or utilized in the non-value added form and it will probably, I don't want to say it will always be that way, but it's certainly been that way for the last 10, 15 years and it certainly is trending that way. So that aspect of it we think the dollar sales will definitely be lower because those prices are coming down on a market basis. But in terms of then the $1 billion plus worth that go out in a value-added form for Jennie-O, those we see holding their own even in this diminished marketplace for commodity. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I'm going to cheat with one follow-up. You raised your guidance $20 million or so pre-tax. How much of that do you think is just a commodity benefit and how much of it do you think is like really earned kind of value-added business? Is it possible to break that out? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't think it is. I mean when you look at the total portfolio, I mean there's elements that Jennie-O probably had some commodity benefit, but there are other parts of the business that are still experiencing general input pressures frankly that diminish their usual returns. So I mean all in, we're all about our balanced model and we're comfortable that for the course of the year with that $0.05 we certainly attained for the first quarter and we expect to be able to hold our plan then for the rest of the year. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mario Contreras from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Good morning. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, I wanted ask in the Refrigerated Foods business, I guess looking at pork, their cutout values, the spread between the cutout values and live hog costs are bit wider than what they've been on a historical range. Is there anything in particular that you see driving this? And how do you see it playing out over the remainder of the year? Is it your expected normalization or is it still going to kind of remain a bit wider than where it's been historically? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Yes, this is Jody. We certainly have seen that spread remain high, although the year-over-year impact to Hormel was not significant. So that was not a big driver for our Refrigerated Foods business this quarter. And we'd expect them to be in more normalized ranges for the rest of the year. The hog prices have come down, but the value of the inputs have also come down and they've maintained that respective spread. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, in the International business, it looks like you confirm the exit of the Vietnam joint venture. I guess I wanted to ask is given that Asia has been kind of a focus in terms of you've talked in the past about wanting to expand there both organically and by M&A. Your experience in Vietnam, does that change your outlook in terms of what you want to do in that region from a growth perspective? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A good question, Mario. No, it really doesn't. I mean maybe it's a refinement that we're going to just redouble our attention on the markets where we have enjoyed better success; China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea. And Vietnam, it's a combination of how that business was structured. We just were not able to find a way to profitability given its verticality. It was feed mills, pig farms, a meat processing business and then ultimately the sale into the marketplace. And after trying for several years in collaboration with our partner there we just decided, look, this doesn't seem to be working for us. And so we've sold our interest to the partner. But no, that should not be seen as a reflection of any sort of abandonment of Asia overall. We're still very high on that. We've been happy with our new plant in China that came onboard with SKIPPY and our ability to grow in Asia with that franchise as well as many of our meat franchises. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Larson from Janney Capital. Your line is open. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thanks, everyone. Thanks for the follow up. I was going to ask this and I didn't. Could you just give us \u2013 and you've talked about this in the past, Jeff, about (32:42) the opportunities with CytoSport for distribution gains. Can you give us a rough idea of what your ACV penetration is today across all the various channels? And then the one thing that CytoSport did bring to you where you didn't a lot of presence was access to the convenience channel, the C-store channel and I believe that was really with the liquid beverage product form for Muscle Milk. Can you give us an idea what we can look for more distribution gains or where we sit on that front? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, on the specifics of ACVs that's probably something maybe Jana could go over with you. I don't have those numbers with me right now, and it kind of does depend by channel. But I certainly can get to the second part of your question. We were fortunate within the convenient store channel to be partner with the Pepsi organization. They do a terrific job within that area. They've enjoyed being partners with the Muscle Milk team for a long time and have been really appreciative of the redoubled effort that we're now able to do to our new product innovation in that area. And so they see it as a growth vehicle for their distributors to utilize and we clearly see it as a growth area for us as well. It does enhance our overall knowledge of the C-store area and we kind of handle the food aspects of the C-store still with our own team with products such as our Don Miguel products and REV and those other types of items, but as we become larger within that segment that can only help in terms of our ability to develop the types of items that the C-store world is looking for. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, thanks, everyone. I'm really pleased with the opportunity to be able to talk about another record performance for the company this quarter. We recognize that there are still a number of challenges that face us this year, but I'm confident that our teams have the plans in place to drive continued growth for our shareholders. Thank you all for joining us today. Operator : This does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making.

Please refer to pages 29 through 36 in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 25, 2015 for more details. It can be accessed on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone. We announced record second quarter earnings this morning of $0.67 per share, up 29% over last year. Segment operating profit increased by 29% with all 5 segments registering gains this quarter. We also generated record sales of $2.3 billion, an increase of 2% over last year on a 5% volume increase. In terms of segment performance, Refrigerated Foods grew segment profit 52%, driven by strong performance by our value-added businesses and lower pork input costs. Segment sales were down 8% this quarter despite a 1% volume increase. Lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by declining pork market values. Additionally, the dissolution of our Precept Foods joint venture announced at the beginning of the year impacts Refrigerated Foods segment sales by approximately 2.5% each quarter in fiscal 2015. We enjoyed strong sales of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of HORMEL pepperoni, HORMEL GATHERINGSTM party trays and Lloyd's Ribs. Foodservice sales of HORMEL BACON 1 fully cooked bacon, OLD SMOKEHOUSE bacon, and HORMEL pizza toppings also delivered solid growth. We launched a new AUSTIN BLUES competition-style barbecue meats line in the Foodservice channel this quarter as we continue to drive innovation in the category. Grocery Products segment profit increased 1% on a 1% increase in sales. Segment results were aided by lower pork input costs along with strong sales growth from SPAM luncheon meat and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. Sales volumes of SKIPPY peanut butter grew this quarter, benefiting from our new advertising campaign, however, dollar sales decreased as a result of the category price decline earlier this year pressuring segment margins. Sales of HORMEL COMPLEATS microwave meals were lower this quarter. Grocery Products continues to drive sales by leveraging our iconic brands in new and innovative ways. We recently kicked off the coast-to-coast SPAMERICAN Tour with our food truck travelling to popular events across the country this summer, featuring SPAM creations by Food Network Chef, Sunny Anderson. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 11% and a sales increase of 32%, largely led by the recently acquired CytoSport business. During the second quarter, we announced that we will be closing the Benicia, California CytoSport manufacturing facility in June and moving portions of the production to our Century Foods operation in Wisconsin and to a third party facility near Benicia. The planned closure of the facility negatively impacted second quarter segment results by $4.5 million. The team continues to achieve additional distribution of our MUSCLE MILK protein-rich products, delivering gains in the club, food, drug and mass and convenience channels this quarter. International and other segment profit increased 2%, while sales fell 7%. Improved joint venture results were mostly offset by lower exports, a result of port issues and a strong U.S. dollar during the quarter. We did experience higher sales of SPAM luncheon meat gift packs, which are popular gifts in South Korea during celebration of the Lunar New Year. Meat sales in our China operations were also up, primarily driven by growth in the Foodservice business. Jennie-O Turkey Store increased segment profit 41% and grew sales 15%. Results were driven by robust sales of value-added products and lower grain and fuel costs as compared to last year. Sales growth was led by Jennie-O lean ground turkey and Jennie-O rotisserie turkey. The Midwest began experiencing significant outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in late March. To date, approximately 55 farms have been impacted that were to supply Jennie-O Turkey Store with turkeys. While we experienced modest financial impact from the outbreak in the second quarter, Jennie-O Turkey Store is estimating a loss of approximately 15% of second half sales. This sizeable estimated loss of volume is not only due to bird losses over the past month, but also takes into account the fact that many of our barns remain empty under quarantine. Due to lack of internal turkey supply, we will be purchasing some additional meat from external sources but at a higher cost. We are also planning for lower sales as we are forced to rationalize some business. As a result of the turkey supply shortages, on May 5, we regrettably announced a temporary layoff of our second shift employees at our Faribault, Minnesota facility. We look forward to welcoming our team members back when bird numbers and production levels return to normal. Our team is working closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control the spread. As always, employee safety and food safety are top priorities in our organization, and we remain focused on safety even as we work through these unprecedented challenges. Looking ahead to the second half, operating margins of Jennie-O Turkey Store will be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain, reducing expected segment operating margins in the back half to the 10% to 12% range. Refrigerated Foods should continue to benefit from strong value-added sales and lower input costs, although segment earnings growth is expected to be less robust in light of difficult comparisons to last year's third quarter. We look for Grocery Products to deliver strong segment profit growth in the back half, benefiting from lower input costs, and softer prior year comparisons. Specialty Foods is positioned for strong performance in the second half as the team has realized synergies, achieved distribution gains and ignited innovation in the recently acquired Muscle Milk business. We expect our International segment to deliver growth in the second half as well with improved export sales and solid results from our China business. Based on our assessment of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store to date, and given that Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments delivered excellent results in the first half, we are maintaining our fiscal 2015 adjusted guidance range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, but expect full year earnings to be near the lower end of this range. Our balanced business model provides Hormel Foods the ability to navigate challenges, such as this year's unprecedented turkey supply shortage and continue to deliver consistent growth over the long term. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $180.2 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to $140.1 million, or $0.52 per share a year ago. Dollar sales for the second quarter totaled $2.28 billion, compared to $2.24 billion last year, a 2% increase. Sales excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products were down 3%. Lower pork prices, the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture, lower exports and the price reduction on SKIPPY peanut butter products were the primary drivers. Volume for the second quarter was 1.29 billion pounds, increasing 5% from the same period last year. Tonnage was up 1% excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport and MegaMex products. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 8.3% of sales, up from 7.4% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher this year due to employee-related expenses along with higher advertising expense. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be between 7.5% and 7.8% of sales. Advertising expense for the quarter was $39.5 million, compared to $34.8 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the MUSCLE MILK brand, which was acquired last August. Equity and earnings of affiliates was $7.9 million in the second quarter versus $3.6 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Foods acquisition not repeated this year, and also savings associated with the exit of the international joint ventures last quarter. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.6% versus 34% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015 full year, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 264 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 270.4 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million versus $31.9 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million in fiscal 2015. Total long term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $27.3 million, down $12.7 million compared to last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $165 million to $180 million. At this time, I will turn the call over to Hanna for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Hanna? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Adam Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, I guess the first question in Jennie-O, I want to understand \u2013 it seems like, Jeff, the details you gave about a $0.09 to $0.12 or so EPS impact in the second half from AI guidance and the full-year range maintained despite moving towards the low end. First, help us bridge what got better in the rest of the business as you think about the outlook that has allowed you to maintain the EPS range. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the first half has been a very strong half for us. Q1, as you recall we were able to raise the guidance range at the conclusion of Q1. Q2 was also a very strong quarter for us. And honestly, but the for the avian influenza incident, we would be talking to you today about raising the guidance range. So, clearly that provided some momentum. I also have the expectation that the other four business segments will generate positive results year-over-year during the second quarter and we'll then be able to offset much of what's going on at Jennie-O for the half. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's great. And maybe at Jennie-O specifically, I want to \u2013 the guidance \u2013 is it \u2013 I mean does it reflect kind of the status quo today? I know no more \u2013 no further cases of AI in Minnesota or in your facilities or does it give you some cushion for some further outbreaks? And how do you think about the impact into 2016 at this point as you still have to get the barns repopulated and potential volume impact as it slips into next year? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We did attempt to bake in at least some sense of, okay, if there's some added percolation going on, there where there might be another outbreak or two and indeed, if you look at it over the last two weeks, we had one fairly significant barn complex encountered the disease. So, we have tried to factor in that somewhat, but also are expecting that the thing should slow down during the summer. The fall is a wildcard in terms of if and when it comes back. In terms of next year, and we really are not in a position to give you any quantifiable new range for Jennie-O or for the whole company for that matter. We're just beginning our planning process. But I do believe it would be fair to say that at this point, the outlook for the first half of the year for Jennie-O Turkey Store should be somewhat subdued based on the issues that you've raised. I mean, it is going to take them some time to get back into full production. I just \u2013 I can't tell you whether that 10% to 12% range though that we gave you for the second half is the right range for the first half yet, but it probably will be something short of what we experienced this year. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And maybe just quickly on that point. The repopulation of the barns, can you walk us through the timeline there? Just help us think through how long it will take to get your volume back to where it was in March? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I can't really give you any precision with that because we're in somewhat new territory. We're working with the government on that. It's going to depend in part upon the continuation of no outbreaks for a timeframe. We do understand that there's recently in Wisconsin the repopulation of a chicken-based facility, so it wasn't one of ours, but \u2013 so the process is at least beginning. But I really can't give that to you with great precision, I mean other than to tell you, obviously once we do get the poults in barn, I mean it's 22 weeks after that before we would be bringing them to the manufacturing facility for our tom based turkeys. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Great. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Could we talk about your Refrigerated Foods business? The results there were exceptional. How sustainable are the results in the second quarter? How long do you think the hog commodity tailwind is going to benefit you? And how are you thinking of product innovation in that segment? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Wow, you loaded a lot of questions into one there, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's all one, yeah. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : She is counting it as one. The hogs, we expect supply to be up 5% to 6% for the year, so I would assume, particularly given the extremely high comps that we had last year due to the disease issues in the industry, that we'll see some reasonable hog prices, so that's a good thing. Domestic demand seems to be pretty robust at this point in time. We do see that exports have fallen a bit so we'll keep an eye on that. But it's really our value-added businesses that are driving the results for Refrigerated Foods. They didn't have a big benefit from any pork operating margins this quarter. It really was the value-added side of the portfolio that was delivering for them. They came in above our guided range, but we'll continue to monitor given the amount of volatility that can occur in that segment. So, I'm not willing to call that this is the new norm going forward. And innovation? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I just would mention \u2013 I mean we received notice here recently that both the REV product and our WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis were named IRI Pacesetter Top 100 New Items from kind of the last 12 to 18 months of introduction. Our Foodservice group has really enjoyed some excellent results with their BACON 1 product and also their Fire Braised meats, so innovation still is a key component to what we're seeing for success for Refrigerated Foods and our other segments. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Great. And then in terms of CytoSport, that acquisition was expected to be roughly $0.05 accretive to EPS this year. Is it on track, is it ahead or behind pace? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, the first quarter was probably slightly behind. The second quarter, if you look at operating results, we were very happy with the results. They did have the additional $4 million plus charge as we made the decision to close the Benicia plant. Over time, that should enhance operating returns and heading into next year then hopefully, we'll be able to increase on that. But we're still comfortable with that number. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: So still around that $0.05 number? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : For this year. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Diane. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : I wanted to ask on the Turkey business, so could you give us an idea about given where things stand today, and obviously can't know about future outbreaks if that happens, but what you expect industry production volumes to be this year down kind of year-on-year for the full year? And then I was also curious to know, do you expect sort of ramped up CapEx to maybe, I don't know, fortify your positions around the barns or whatever to protect from potential future outbreaks? I know we don't get high path AI very often, I think the last outbreak was over 10 years ago. But I guess I'm just curious \u2013 it seems to have decimated turkeys and I guess table egg layers. And so, I guess the question is should the industry be spending more to defend against potential future outbreaks and would that include you as well? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Both good questions. On the expected turkey volumes. I mean, I can tell you the USDA has not modified their number from the 3% to 4% increase that they expected for the industry. I mean, given our experience and given that we're sort of tied for one of the lead players in terms of volume in the industry, I guess I have a hard time seeing how those numbers happen if we're going to be short 20% in terms of at least turkeys coming into our system and about 15% net of the meat we're going to have to buy. So, I don't have an adjusted total industry number for you, but I guess I'm skeptical as to the industry's ability to hit that 3% to 4% gain number. In terms of ramped up CapEx, I think the theory that you've laid out is probably correct. We're still a little too early to know exactly what might be required. But in talking with APHIS and just kind of studying, okay, what are better ways to potentially prevent this in the future. And also given the fact that there seems to have been airborne introduction this time, and so that may cause some added fan and ventilation requirements that will be different than what we've done in the past. I think it probably would be safe to assume some additional level of CapEx spending, but I don't have any ability to tell you whether \u2013 what the delta is versus normal either for Jennie-O or for the total company heading into next year. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Is the AI outbreak covered under any insurance plan you might have, business interruption or any other \u2013 or is it seen as sort of an act of God and is non-insurable? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : It's a non-insurable event, although as it has been in the press, the government helps farmers with birds that they have to euthanize. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Larson with Janney Capital Markets. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and good morning, everyone. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Eric. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Good morning. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Jeff, just kind of a strategic question with Jennie-O. I mean, obviously your production is highly concentrated and it is highly efficient obviously with your manufacturing facilities in the upper Midwest, Minnesota. Is there any thought that maybe you should geographically diversify some of your production over time? I mean maybe via an acquisition somewhere that gives you \u2013 maybe try to get off the Mississippi flyway or some other thing. I mean, does this prompt some different thoughts strategically how you might run the business? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I guess I would concede that this is \u2013 given this unprecedented and rare incident that's kind of exposed a little bit an Achilles' heel to the strategy of being very centralized. It had been a tremendous advantage in the past in terms of just knowledge of feed within an area and growing practices, the ability to move meat from plant to optimize products and so forth. And indeed, all of our facilities are either in Minnesota or Wisconsin. So, whether this is something that then prompts a change in that, we're still on the triage mode right now and I guess that's something on a strategic long-term basis I'll be talking with the team about. But it's a valid question. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay, thanks. And then just back to the Refrigerated division again, it's very impressive to see the fact that your hog prices are so low, but you're able to hold your pricing at retail with your value-added products. Can you give us a rough idea of what percent of your Refrigerated volume today would be, quote, value added? And I don't know how you want to define that necessarily, whether it's your all marinated products and flavored products. And is there a way that we can think about that, that helps us \u2013 because it looks like it's a longer-term positive margin shift for you that's become more apparent in the last 12 months. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : So, I think we've discussed before that about 70% of our Refrigerated Foods portfolio would be considered value-added. But understand included in that 70% would even be things that have pricing that's more market-driven such as bacon and hams and our marinated fresh meat. And even on the Foodservice side, some of the contracts they have for items are driven by market forces. So, yeah, the team has performed well, they have a focus on providing great value for our customers, but also making sure that there's a margin left for us. Eric J. Larson - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Next, we'll go to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Mario. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: In terms of M&A, how is the company's acquisition pipeline relative to recent quarters? And then secondly, does the increased company resources focused on avian flu limit the company's interest in pursuing M&A, at least in the near-term? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I guess from a pipeline standpoint, I mean, we're \u2013 I don't have anything different to report than normal. I mean, we certainly have a track record of generating growth through M&A along with our product innovations and doing a better job with our traditional items. And we continue to look for both family-owned businesses and institutional properties that might come out, but I don't have anything to report specifically on that. In terms of AI, clearly it is a time-consuming challenge, particularly for the Jennie-O Turkey Store team, but it's not having any impact in terms of our overall team's ability to seek out M&A opportunities, nor would it have any issues in regard to our ability to finance such a transaction. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then, just as a follow-up, I guess maybe stepping back a little bit, there's been a pretty significant or increasing industry focus on ZBB and overhead reductions. So, how do you feel about Hormel's overall overhead spending? And do you anticipate any changes to the company's strategy regarding that? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Well, I do not plan to announce any special cost reduction initiative. I think that's kind of the culture that we live by day-by-day. We always run a pretty lean operation with a lot of processes in place such as Jeff signing off on any salaried employee that's being added to the payroll. So, everything gets a pretty difficult look. We do \u2013 I would argue that we already have been doing zero-based budgeting for many years, but we just didn't call it that. So, I'm pleased with the initiatives we have underway with the constant look at expenses and keeping things in line. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go next to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Lubi J. Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning. This is actually Lubi on for Akshay. Just with regards to your Jennie-O outlook for the second half, can you just talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about the cadence between third quarter and fourth quarter? I mean, will it be fairly evenly distributed, or do you think things sort of get progressively worse before stabilizing again? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I mean, they're both significantly challenged and to a pretty close level, is our best shot at it right now. And we're short the birds already in terms of what's been going on over the last several weeks, so we're in it. Lubi J. Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And then, could you provide us maybe an update on how SKIPPY performed during the quarter domestically and internationally, and also REV Wraps? Thank you. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. SKIPPY on a domestic basis, we were pleased that we returned to volume growth and expect that to continue going forward. We did see with the price decline, our net sale number was down. And as I mentioned in the introductory comments, that did squeeze our operating margins a little bit on SKIPPY. We're happy, thus far, with the performance of the ad campaign. We've been able to see demonstrable results in advertised markets that were enhanced over the non-advertised markets. And we also continue to look for new product innovation, and we'll have some things to show the marketplace later this year in that regard in terms of the SKIPPY brand. Outside of the United States, so far, our experience in China has been \u2013 it's kind of an up and down quarter-to-quarter business. The second quarter wasn't particularly strong this last quarter, but in visiting with the team, they're very comfortable that they will see overall growth in terms of the SKIPPY international portfolio for the second half of the year as they have programs in place to generate that. In terms of REV, we're kind of making a little bit of a transition with that product. We, upon advice of some of our trade customers, we've changed the case, we've changed the product packaging somewhat. We're trying to attain a price point that we think is going to be able to stimulate the next wave of growth for that item. And so, second quarter kind of was the transition quarter for that. The new products are now in the marketplace and then we're complementing that with a new ad campaign that just launched at the very end of April. And early reads on that are positive, but we'll be able to give you that full report when Q3 is done. Lubi J. Kutua - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : Next, we'll go to Rachel Nabatian with Credit Suisse. Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So I wanted to ask about the normalized margin range for Refrigerated Foods. With demand for protein being quite strong and pork input costs going longer due to the rising supplies, isn't this pretty much an ideal scenario for the Refrigerated Foods division and maybe even Grocery? And do you think that we can assume that margins can stay at the high end of this normalized range for quite some time? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : I think I addressed it earlier, but never hurts to reemphasize. We're certainly pleased with how the value-added portfolio within Refrigerated Foods delivered for this quarter. But given the fact that we have pork operating margins, as well as a component of commodity sales within that portfolio, we're still sticking to our 5% to 8% range, and when we see that, that's been sustained for a period of time then we'll take a relook at it. The guidance we've given is for over the longer term and through different types of market cycles. So I would expect that the value-added piece should still keep going. Grocery Products definitely should benefit from lower pork input prices particularly on the SPAM family of products, and that should help drive their results in the back half. Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. And then the pork packing margins that we track has been very good so far this year. Can you just remind us how this \u2013 how the pork processing trend (33:38) flows through your Refrigerated Foods business and how maybe excess supply might benefit that business later on in the year? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : So, it's all in \u2013 the pork packing margins, or the pork operating margins, as we call it, are included in the Refrigerated Foods. And, yes, they were \u2013 they have been lower than last year. Part of that is due to the \u2013 what they call the dropped credits, the parts of the animal that traditionally are sold overseas. And with the port issues and the continued strong dollar, we've seen those values go down. So, I think that's impacted the whole industry. I would expect that some of that may pick up in the back half, as we work through the port issues. I'm not recalling the last part of your question. Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Oh, yeah, I was just wondering if maybe there was too much supply, if that might be a benefit for the processing operations. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP : Usually, we like to see \u2013 low hog prices are the best thing for our operating divisions. Rachel N. Nabatian - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, this is Jeff. I just wanted to conclude by saying we're very pleased with the record second quarter earnings we were able to announce today. While the next few months certainly will be challenging for our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment, we will look to our experienced team and our balanced business model to deliver a successful year in fiscal 2015. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the Hormel Foods Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jana Haynes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jana L. Haynes - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6 :00 AM, Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter, and then Jody will provide detailed financial results. The line will be opened for questions following Jody's remarks.

An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11 :00 AM Central Time today, August 19, 2015. The dial-in number is 888-203-1112 and the access code is 1732023. The audio replay will be posted on our website and archived for one year. Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks. Please refer to pages 34 through 40 in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 26, 2015 for more details. It can be accessed on our website. Also, please note the company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Discussion of non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jana, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share, up 10% over last year with four of our five segments registering gains this quarter. We generated sales of $2.2 billion, a decrease of 4% versus last year on a 3% volume increase. Sales were lower due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets, primarily impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments. To illustrate the dramatic change in pork markets, the average USDA pork cutoff price in July of 2014 was $133 compared to $83 in July of 2015, almost a 40% decrease. While across the company our team is generally focused on our goal of 5% top line growth, in this particular market scenario, volume growth may be the more appropriate metric by which to gauge results. I will now take you through each segment. Refrigerated Foods finalized the purchase of Applegate near the end of the third quarter on July 13, 2015. I am pleased to welcome the Applegate team to Hormel Foods. Refrigerated Foods grew operating profit 9% inclusive of incurring $8.6 million in transaction cost related to the acquisition of Applegate. Results were driven by lower pork input cost and strong performance by our value-added retail and food-service businesses. Refrigerated Foods sales were down 11% this quarter despite a 2% volume increase. As I mentioned earlier, lower sales were primarily due to pricing decreases on items such as bacon, driven by the declining pork market values. We enjoyed strong sales growth of many of our value-added items during the quarter, including retail sales of Hormel pepperoni, and Hormel Gatherings party trays, and foodservice sales of Hormel Natural Choice deli meats and Hormel Fire Braised meats. Grocery Products delivered an excellent segment profit increase of 57% on an 8% sales increase. Segment results were driven by favorable raw material cost, and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter, HORMEL chili, and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE refrigerated dips. WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis in a single-serve container have been a key driver to the brand's growth this past year. They squarely meet consumer's desires for portable, better-for-use snacking options. Grocery Products continues to build brand equity and drive sales with marketing support for key items. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit decreased 45% and sales decreased 12%. Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza, as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now repopulated approximately two-thirds of the farms' previously impacted and we expect to complete the repopulation process during the fourth quarter. While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat from other suppliers to partially offset flock losses, Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to estimate approximately 15% lower sales in the fourth quarter versus last year, similar to the sales impact in the third quarter. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks. Our Specialty Foods segment reported a robust operating profit increase of 79%. Improvements to the cost structure in the CytoSport and Century Foods operations, along with stronger performance in our Specialty Products business benefited results this quarter. Specialty Foods segment sales increased 31%, largely driven by the recently acquired CytoSport business. The CytoSport team has achieved additional distribution of MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products with big gains coming from one of our more recent product introductions, MUSCLE MILK PRO SERIES. Innovation is a top priority for our CytoSport business, and we look forward to the launch of some great new items currently in the pipeline for our MUSCLE MILK brand. International & Other segment profit increased 3%, while sales declined 6%. Higher royalties on sales of our SPAM family of products, strong performance by our China businesses, and increased sales of SKIPPY peanut butter drove the profit gains. However, sales and margins were hampered by significantly lower pork exports due to soft demand in key markets in East Asia. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Refrigerated Foods to benefit from value-added sales increases and lower input costs. We look for Grocery Products to deliver another quarter of strong segment profit growth, with favorable raw material cost and volume growth in key categories. Jennie-O Turkey Store will continue to be significantly challenged due to the impacts of avian influenza on our turkey supply chain. However, we do anticipate modest margin improvement as compared to third quarter results. Specialty Foods should finish the year well based on the fast-paced growth and improved cost structure of our recently acquired MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. And we expect our International segment to continue to face headwinds in the pork export markets over the near term, partially offset with anticipated gains from our China businesses. Given the strong results through three quarters, along with our positive outlook for Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Specialty Foods as we close the year, and better visibility of the impact of avian influenza on Jennie-O Turkey Store in the near term, we are raising our fiscal 2015 non-GAAP earnings guidance range from $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up to $2.57 to $2.63 per share. I am proud of our experienced team as we have demonstrated our ability to navigate an unprecedented raw material supply challenge and still be on track to deliver another double-digit increase in earnings in fiscal 2015. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $146.9 million or $0.54 per share, compared to $138 million or $0.51 per share a year ago. Excluding the impact of Applegate-related transaction cost of $8.6 million, non-GAAP earnings were $0.56 per share. Consistent with our guidance, given on the announcement of the deal, we expect the Applegate acquisition to be net neutral to fiscal 2015 earnings. The bulk of deal-related expenses have been booked in the third quarter. The non-GAAP adjusted earnings guidance Jeff provided of $2.57 to $2.63 per share for fiscal 2015 assumes this neutral impact on a full year basis for the Applegate acquisition. Dollar sales for the third quarter totaled $2.19 billion compared to $2.28 billion last year, a 4% decrease. Sales, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate, and MegaMex products that were not included in last year's results, were down 10%. Lower pork prices, lower turkey supply, and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year. Volume for the third quarter was 1.21 billion pounds, increasing 3% from the same period last year. Tonnage was down 2%, excluding the incremental impact of CytoSport, Applegate, and MegaMex products not included in last year's results. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were 8.4% of sales, up from 6.7% last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher compared to last year due to increased advertising expense, the Applegate deal cost, and employee-related expenses. For the full year, we expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales. Advertising expenses for the quarter were $34 million compared to $21 million last year. The increase was due mostly to advertising expense at CytoSport for the Muscle Milk brand which was acquired last August, as well as increased Hormel Brands support in the Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segment compared to last year. Equity and earnings of affiliates was $6.4 million in the third quarter versus $3.5 million last year. The increase is largely the result of prior-year incentive expenses related to the Fresherized Foods business not repeated this year, as well as savings associated with the exit from the international joint venture businesses announced in the first quarter of this year. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.1 million, unchanged from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 35.6% versus 34.7% in fiscal 2014. For fiscal 2015, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 34.5% and 35%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 264.3 million. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 270.6 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33.3 million versus $33.5 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2015. Total long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, unchanged from last year. The Applegate acquisition was funded in July with cash and $350 million of short-term debt. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $41.8 million, up from $34.8 million last year. For fiscal 2015, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million to $165 million. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Levi? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Congratulations on a good quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: I have questions regarding two of your smaller businesses. The first one's on Specialty. How has the restructuring of the supply chain benefited you? And how sustainable do you anticipate those Specialty margins to be? They were pretty strong this current quarter. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : When we announced the Muscle Milk deal, we mentioned how one of the benefits we saw was that we did have familiarity and experience within the segment with our Century Foods operation. They're a manufacturer on the powdered side of that business. We have taken the opportunity to combine the previous manufacturing capabilities in Benicia with the Sparta, Wisconsin-based Century operation. And you're seeing some of the benefit of that already being reflected in the Q3 results. Another key area of gains has just been the general management of the business in terms of organizing the sales and marketing structures and so forth and then a lot of top line benefit. I mean, the business is growing very nicely. We've been able to gain distribution in the food, drug, and mass channel. We've been able to rejuvenate the portfolio in the Specialty channel. We continue to enjoy an excellent relationship with Pepsi in terms of distribution into the convenience channel and also parts of the food, drug and mass. The Muscle Milk franchise, on a Nielsen basis, the ready-to-drink items grew in the high single-digit levels and the powdered items grew double-digit. And so that's all contributing to very solid results, and I do believe this new level of performance for Specialty Foods should be repeatable in Q4. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then on International, you were quite positive about your Chinese business. With all that's going on in China, could you just share with us your reasons for being positive, especially given the more constrained pork supplies in China, and then your outlook for that division as it relates to exports of U.S. pork? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. I mean, we're really happy with the performance of the China group. I mean, you look back even four years ago, that business was not making money, or maybe barely making money. And this year, it's going to be a solidly double-digit returning entity. We provide niche products in that market, particularly to the foodservice channel. Obviously, SKIPPY would be another retail-based item. And so to us, at least so far the macro level things going on with their currency and their stock market and so forth, we really have not seen any detrimental impact to our sales capabilities or our margins on that business. In terms of exports, it was a more challenging quarter for International. We've had some port issues. Obviously, there was the U.S. port issues earlier in the year, that was less of an effect in Q3. We continue to have Philippine-based port issues, though, that did impact Q3 results. We've seen a little bit of a turndown in demand in some of the key Asian markets, particularly Korea and China that we sell some of our products to. So that was a more challenging area. I mean, typically, for the last four years, you've seen International deliver top line and bottom line double-digit growth, and we clearly haven't done that the last couple of quarters. So we need to turn that around. But notwithstanding that, I mean, China is growing double-digits, SKIPPY is growing double-digits. So we're very high on what International should be able to achieve overall. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you for the added color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for the question. I guess, a couple questions. One is that I definitely understand the declining export environment into China. And, I guess, my concern had been that it might lead to excess supplies domestically. And certainly you're already seeing the price of cuts of pork falling quite a bit. Jeff, is there any concern that the declining values could lead to more, I guess, price competition for bacon and for cold cuts, and then threaten the spreads that you're getting on the value-added side, and then perhaps even the packing spreads as well? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director: So Jeff's pointing at me, Rob. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : She's our resident expert. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director: Yes. I do agree. Hog supplies are up and prices are low, which have been a benefit to our value-added franchises, and we do have some items that are considered more supply chain such as bacon and ham that will move with pricing, but we've been able to maintain a nice margin profile. And then we have a lot of our portfolio that just doesn't move quite as rapidly with changes in market conditions such as the items Jeff called out being pepperoni and the party tray business. We're fully expecting hog supplies to continue to increase for the balance of the year. Exports will remain a wild card, if you will. I think the USDA is calling for them to be up over 4% for the year when they're down 4% through June. So we'll see if that happens or not. Pork operating margins have been lower than last year. We saw extremely high results last year in our third quarter. We're expecting them to be, say, neutral to our results for the fourth quarter. So that's kind of my take on the pork markets. Hopefully I answered all your questions. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. I mean, to the degree that it's possible. I guess as you look at fiscal 2016, is it fair to say that you could still have a very, very strong year in Refrigerated just because of the value-added pricing powers there or is it kind of a year where you're like, well, maybe it's kind of more of a normalized year? Because your margins are well above your normalized levels and that was just my thinking about 2016. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director: So, right now we are just in the beginning of putting together our assumptions and market conditions for our 2016 planning process. So, I really can't even comment on what we're thinking at this point in time. We do continue to believe that our value-added franchises should continue to grow as well as provide nice margin results. So, we'll give you an update on 2016 on our next call. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Diane. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : So, I wanted to ask about Applegate, which I appreciate you've owned for about 30 days. But you did give some commentary on your expectations for fiscal 2015 I think net neutral to EPS this year. As you make your way through the transition process of bringing that on to your books, et cetera, is there anything that you've seen would makes you more excited or less excited? And then, Jody, I wanted to ask on the debt that you took on for that. I think you said short-term, so I think there's a bit contingent of us on the Street that's looking for you guys to really kind of lever up your balance sheet. But to me, it sounds like you've taken on some short-term debt to fund that and you probably will pay that off with cash flow in the next 12 months. Is that how we should be thinking about that? I'm just trying to model your interest heading into 2016. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'll take the first part. We're still very excited about Applegate. As you point out, I mean, it's been a month, counting today, and if you really look at the quarterly results, I mean, you're talking barely even a couple of weeks of results. However, if you just look at the general business trends, they're still rocking along at double-digit growth rates and we're very excited about the ability of that franchise to connect with consumers. A lot of activity has been going on in terms of getting the teams to meet each other and seeing if there are opportunities to take advantage of each other's capabilities. But we're still very high on what Applegate should be able to deliver for us in Q4 and beyond. Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director: So, as far as the debt, you are correct. We are expecting to have any outstanding amounts repaid in 2016, I would say mid-year, which leaves us with a very good balance sheet capable of taking on other opportunities and we continue to look for strategic investments, whether it's internally or externally through acquisitions. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Great. And then, just a quick question on JOTS and AI. I mean, you're repopulating. It sounds like you'd be fully repopulated by the end of the fourth quarter. Is there less risk during this upcoming migration? Because the wild birds are going from the northern tier to the southern tier or do you \u2013 are you at all concerned that there's going to be sort of another kind of flurry of AI activity that would put those newly repopulated birds at risk for contagion again. I'm just trying to \u2013 sounds like you're filling up the barns and there's a little bit of risk associated with that. I mean, what are you feeling about that? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think your last line just summed it up very well. We are filling up the barns but there clearly is at least a little bit of risk associated with that. We've heard a similar theory as to perhaps birds go south faster than they come north and they may not linger as long in the areas, and so that might be a positive factor. But I mean, at this point, it's just such a wild card. I mean, this was an unprecedented incident already. We're trying to learn from it, the government's trying to learn from it. It could hit other parts of the country, it could hit another time of the year, it could go away, it could come back in a smaller manner. And so, we're trying to be ready for any contingency. And the best I can tell you right now is we haven't had a system outbreak since early June and that frankly even if something did hit this fall, it won't affect 2015 results. Because I mean, you just wouldn't see the loss of bird flow that quickly. But by the time we're talking again in November, we should have a much better sense of whether something seems to be occurring on a fall basis this year or not and what potential impact that might have. Even if nothing occurs, however, and as we indicated the last call, I mean with the 22-week lifespan and with egg shortages and so forth, I mean, we're expecting volume struggles even in the first half of next year until we cycle through this. Diane R. Geissler - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you for the additional color. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. This is Jason filling in for Adam. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jason. Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, Grocery volumes were flat year-over-year in 3Q after falling 3% to 5% for the prior four quarters? Do you think this is reflective of easy comps or some of the efforts that you've made to stabilize volumes in that segment? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we'd like to think the latter, but I mean, I would acknowledge there's some element of the former going on. The Grocery results continue to be \u2013 I mean, you really have to kind of read them carefully in the sense that one of the things we pull out is the Fresherized sales. But when you pull out sort of both years' worth of Fresherized sales, I mean, you're neglecting the fact that that's one of our fastest growing franchises. That's a double-digit gainer when you look at it on a apples-to-apples basis. So, we're excited about that. We had double-digit gains from HORMEL chili this quarter. We had gains from Dinty Moore and Mary Kitchen hash. So it's all \u2013 a number of items doing quite well. SPAM was down slightly after last quarter being up 10%, so that franchise overall, I'm really quite content with where they're headed. So overall \u2013 and then SKIPPY had a good quarter which we're happy to see. Overall, I think that the trend for Grocery is positive. I'm happy to see the changes that have been made. Jason M. Fraprie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. This is Patrick filling in for Ken. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Patrick. Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States): You kind of touched on this earlier. Can you discuss or give a little bit more color on the pricing environment across some of your key categories, especially with the input prices declining? I guess is promotional and pricing activity picking up or which category you should see limited pricing? Jody H. Feragen - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President & Director: Sure. Obviously those items that are more supply-chain related, bacon and ham, would have it as well as any fresh items, our flavored fresh items, and small amount of commodity will move with the marketplace. We do have a large foodservice business. Some of those contracts have levers that react to marketplaces. But, I think the team has done a really nice job of looking at really stressing and selling the innovative items that we have in the marketplace and those have a tendency to not be as volatile to commodity price movements. Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And just a quick follow-up. I guess, we were expecting your deli customers to switch from high-priced turkey breasts to hams. That hasn't really played out. Do you expect that to happen sometime soon over the next couple of months, next year? What are your thoughts on that? Thank you. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, it's not just a matter of the price. I mean, realistically, we have seen within both the Hormel deli group and the Jennie-O deli group, we've not been able to fill orders on a complete basis. We've been on an allocation to customers, an allocation internally. And so, clearly, we've made the effort to try to convert some of those sales into ham-based items, and we've seen some of that go on. But, overall, it's not just the price that's constraining our ability to service the deli with turkey right now. Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Mario. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I just wanted to ask, first, in the Jennie-O Turkey segment, can you confirm how much, I guess, of the volume loss, how much of that was loss of your supply versus external purchases that sort of helped bridge the gap? And then I guess in addition to that, as far as the EBIT headwinds, how much of that was volume deleveraged versus, again, the higher cost of these external purchases? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, on the first question, I mean, I can give you \u2013 it's not exactly an apples-to-apples, but it'll give you directionally what we're talking about. I mean, the bird loss, if you will, ended the system near 20%. And then when you netted it out and there's some price differential here, I mean, it was a 12% sales drop. So, we were able to buy in some meat, mostly on the dark meat side during the quarter in order to try to mitigate that effect. And we're looking at similar levels for Q4 realistically. In terms of the EBITDA drop, I mean, I really don't have a way of quantifying exactly what's what. I mean, there were some costs in the live production system that were reimbursed by the government. There were some costs that weren't. When you're that short in volume in your plants, that creates all sorts of overhead issues. When you literally don't have products to sell, I mean, you're losing that margin and that volume. So there were all those factors combined that moved us down from the kind of run rate Jennie-O had been operating at to what we thought we would hit and what we did hit this quarter. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. I see. And then one follow-up, moving to the Refrigerated Foods segment. There has been some consolidation in the pork industry, a couple of your key competitors, looks like there's a pending consolidation going on there. Is there any impact on your strategy? I mean, how does \u2013 does that change the way that you fit into the industry? What are your thoughts on that? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think it really does. I mean, our philosophy when it comes to pork is we do want to control our own destiny and we have for years, so even years ago when Oscar Mayer and Sara Lee chose to get out of being vertical in hog processing and rely on others for their meat supply, we made the decision to stick with it. And frankly, as the industry consolidates, to me that decision is even more firm that we need to be able to control our own destiny. That being said, we've never tried to be one of the big players when it comes to pork slaughter. And so, we're still four, five, six, somewhere in that range, and I would expect us to stay there. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go to another question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Wow. Look how fast this call goes without Akshay around. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : He'll be back next quarter. I'm sure he's listening to it. Hi, Akshay. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Sure he is. But, SKIPPY, just one point of question here. In the Nielsen data it did not show really much growth at all in SKIPPY, and you had said it had a really good quarter. So is there something that we're not seeing there, maybe some alternative products that are doing well on test or channels that are not being measured? Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I probably should let Jana follow up with you rather than speculate on that. I just know in terms of our shipment data domestically, it was a solid quarter both for volume and net sales. Outside of the U.S. it was a double-digit gain, but that wouldn't be \u2013 being reflected in the data you're looking at. But why don't I let her give you some added color as to the match-up of Nielsen versus the shipments. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : It would seem at this time, we have no further questions. Jeffrey M. Ettinger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, I'd like to just make a little concluding statement. 2015 is shaping up to be an excellent year in terms of earnings growth for the company. Based on the increased non-GAAP earnings guidance range of $2.57 to $2.63 per share, we would expect to deliver a 15% to 18% earnings increase over our record performance in fiscal 2014. Our balanced business model has again allowed us to limit volatility in a challenging supply situation, while our experienced team has demonstrated their ability to navigate changing market conditions and continue to drive growth. Thank you, all, for joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's conference. We appreciate your participation.",

Patrick Chen - BMO Capital Markets Heather Jones - BB&T Capital Markets Diane Geissler - CLSA Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Operator : Good day and welcome to the Hormel Foods Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jana Haynes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ma'am. Jana Haynes : Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6 :30 AM, Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Snee, President and Chief Operating Officer and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide a review of the operating results for the quarter, and then Jim will comment on our outlook and guidance for fiscal 2016.

An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11 :30 AM Central Time today, November 24, 2015. The dial-in number is 888-329-8893 and the access code is 6355504. It will also be posted to our website and archived for one year. Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the Company are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 34 through 40 in the Company's 10-Q filed on September 4, 2015. It can be accessed on our website. Additionally, please note the Company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors with the better understanding of the Company's operating performance by excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items effecting comparability. Discussion of non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted earnings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey Ettinger : Thanks very much, Jana, and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report a strong finish to fiscal 2015. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $0.74 per share, up 17% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, down 6%. For the full year the Company earned and adjusted $2.64 per share representing an 18% increase over fiscal 2014. On an adjusted basis, all five segments registered earnings growth this year. Sales for the full year were $9.3 billion, a decrease of 1%. Lower sales for the quarter and the year were primarily due to turkey supply shortages in our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and price deflation in the pork markets impacting sales within our Refrigerated Foods and International segments. I will now take you through each segment. Grocery Products operating profit was up 57% in the quarter. Normalized input costs and improved productivity drove the gains. Sales grew 4% this quarter led by SKIPPY peanut butter, DINTY MOORE stew, HORMEL chilly, and WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips. For the year, adjusted segment profit was up 23% and sales were up 4%. We are especially pleased with the sales growth of our SKIPPY peanut butter products given a price decrease in the peanut butter category earlier this year. We continue to build momentum in our snacking portfolio with excellent results from our WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis along with positive early reads on our most recent innovation SKIPPY P.B. Bites!. Refrigerated Foods' fourth quarter segment profit increased 27%, with sales down 5% and volume up 2%. For the full year, operating profit in this segment was up 26% and sales decreased 6% on a volume increase of 1%. Results in the fourth quarter were driven by nice increases by our affiliated foods businesses, higher pork operating margins, the addition of the APPLEGATE business, and an improved product mix. Our Refrigerated Foods team had a heightened focus on margin expansion this year and has made nice strides. Lower dollar sales reflect price reductions on some items compared to last year's record high pork markets and the dissolution of Precept Foods the latter of which we will have lapped after this quarter. Our Foodservice group continues to deliver innovative solutions for foodservice operators with notable growth on items such as our HORMEL Fire Braised meats and HORMEL pizza toppings. On the retail side of the business, HORMEL pepperoni, HORMEL refrigerated entrees and HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays delivered sales gains this quarter. We have owned the APPLEGATE business for a few months now and we are pleased with its performance constrained partially by the availability of pork and turkey raw materials during the quarter. The APPLEGATE team remains on track to deliver results consistent with our initial guidance for this business. Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit declined 23% on an 18% sales decrease. For the full year, operating profit was up 1% and sales decreased 2%. Results were impacted by high pathogen avian influenza as flocks lost earlier this year created large volume shortfalls in operations and sales. We have now completed the repopulation of all of our turkey barns. We've not experienced any new outbreaks thus far into the fall migration of wild birds. While we have been able to purchase some turkey meat to partially offset flock losses, turkey breast prices remain at a record high due to overall industry shortages. Our team continues to work closely with government agencies and other organizations as they study this virus and work to control future outbreaks, and with our customers as we managed through the turkey breast meat shortages. We have made many adjustments and are prepared to minimize any future impact to our operations in the event that the virus returns to our area as the migration season progresses. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an adjusted operating profit increase of 155%. Muscle Milk sport nutrition products sales increased nicely though the gain was not enough to offset some reductions in contract packaging sales, leading to a net 3% decrease in overall segment sales this quarter. Full year results for Specialty Foods showed adjusted operating profit of 48% with sales up 22%. The positive fourth quarter segment profit results reflect synergies captured within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain and a beneficial comparison to last year CytoSport acquisition related costs of $9.3 million. The CytoSport acquisition is meeting our valuation expectations. We have decided to explore the sale of a portion of our Diamond Crystal Brands business. While the business is still performing acceptably, we feel it no longer fits within our strategic priorities. We will pursue a sale over the course of the next few months allowing us to redeploy capital and investments that better support our growth goals. International's fourth quarter operating profit increased 3% on flat dollar sales and a 5% higher volume. Results were driven by strong SPAM luncheon meat exports and continued growth of our China business muted by soft demand for fresh pork exports in certain markets. For the full year, adjusted operating profit in the International segment was up 4% on flat sales. In October, the leader of our International segment for the past few years, Jim Snee was elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer and was appointed to our Board of Directors. Jim is only the 10th President in our Company's 124-year history. In his new capacity, Jim will be responsible for all five reporting segments. While the finance functions including M&A, R&D, legal, supply chain, and human resources will continue to report to me. Jim's vast experience in both our Refrigerated Foods segment and our emerging growth markets internationally position him exceptionally well to take on these additional responsibilities. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our long-term segment margin guidance and 2016 outlook. James Snee : Thank you, Jeff. Good morning to all of you. Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect renewed revenue growth as the year proceeds. Grocery Products should benefit from improved pork and beef input costs this year especially as compared to the first half of 2015. Along with positive sales trends for our key product lines including WHOLLY GUACAMOLE dips, SKIPPY peanut butter, and our SPAM family of products, we have made significant improvements in manufacturing efficiencies over this past year, giving us the confidence to raise our long-term Grocery Products segment operating margin guidance from 12% to 14% up to the 13% to 15% range going forward. Our value-added businesses and Refrigerated Foods should benefit from favorable raw material costs and the segment is positioned to start the year with strong earnings momentum. We expect modestly lower pork operating margins and hog prices in 2016, and plan to increase pork production by 1% to 2% over fiscal 2015. While Refrigerated Foods clearly benefited from favorable market conditions in 2015 our team has also made significant progress in their efforts to improve product mix and drive sustainable margin improvements. Given these advancements, we are increasing our long-term segment profit margin range from 5% to 8% up to 7% to 10% going forward. We look for Jennie-O Turkey Store to return to growth in the back half of the year if there are no significant recurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Volumes will remain constrained in the early part of the year as we continue to rebuild our system after significant bird losses last spring. In addition to lower volumes, Jennie-O Turkey Store is also facing difficult comparisons to fiscal 2015's strong first half performance. We expect turkey breast meat prices to remain elevated until the industry can see the impact of the spring bird migration. Lower grain input costs will be a tailwind in 2016. In terms of long-term segment profit margin guidance, we are modestly tightening our guidance range for Jennie-O Turkey Store previously at 13% to 17% narrowed to 14% to 17%. We expect the Specialty Foods segment to deliver increases through the growth of our MUSCLE MILK protein nutrition products. Protein nutrition products remain on trend and promising new products in our innovation pipeline for this category should continue to drive success. Our long-term segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods remains at 8% to 11%. Though we are encouraged to see their upward migration within this range, the range does include contributions from the Diamond Crystal Brands business. If a sale occurs, we will provide an updated guidance range for this segment. We look for the International segment to achieve year-over-year improved results through increased sales of our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products along with expansion of our China business. We are maintaining our long-term International segment margin guidance at 14% to 17%. From a total Company perspective, in light of the improved ranges mentioned, we are increasing our operating profit margins range from 9% to 12% to a new range of 10% to 13% reflecting our current business structure, product mix, and typical market volatility. Deporting our brands remains the top focus for us. In 2016, we are planning a double-digit increase in advertising support over the prior year. We will focus advertising dollars on REV's snack Wraps HORMEL GATHERINGS party trays, HORMEL pepperoni, our SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, MUSCLE MILK protein rich products, and in the back half of the year, we expect to reignite our Jennie-O Make The Switch campaign. The MegaMex joint venture will also continue to provide significant marketing support to the wholly and [Herdez] brands of Mexican food products. We also plan to reinvest in our business through higher capital investments in fiscal 2016. We expect to complete the construction of our new plant in [Zhanjiang], China and start production there by the end of 2016. Here in the U.S., we intend to increase capacity for our HORMEL bacon products and Jennie-O fresh turkey tray pack items. Additionally, we plan to expand our research and development capabilities through the construction of a newest new facility to support our team's constant focus on food safety, quality, and innovation. After taking these significant factors into account, we've established our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share. At this time, I will turn the call over at Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015. Jody Feragen : Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. On a GAAP basis, net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $187.2 million, up 9% over last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, a 10% increase. Excluding non-recurring charges adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 totaled $199.9 million, up 17% from net earnings of $171.3 million last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.74, up 17% compared to $0.63 per share a year ago. As Jeff mentioned, we made the decision to sell a portion of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. This business has now been classified as held for sale and asset impairment tests were performed as part of the evaluation process. The fourth quarter included pre-tax non-recurring charges of $21.5 million relating to a goodwill impairment charge for this business and that is reflected in our Specialty Foods segment. We also had a positive $8.9 million adjustment due to a reduction of a contingent consideration liability related to the CytoSport acquisition. This adjustment was due to an updated evaluation of the earn-out targets associated with the acquisition. The CytoSport earn-out agreement requires aggressive financial targets to be met and sales got off to a slower start than anticipated in the earn-out. To be clear CytoSport continues to meet the base business case used in our valuations. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.64 representing an 18% increase over last year with all five segments contributing to the earnings growth. Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion for the same period last year, a 6% decrease. Sales were down 10% excluding the incremental impact of APPLEGATE and MegaMex products not included in last year's results. Lower pork prices, turkey supply shortages due to high path avian influenza and the dissolution of the Precept Foods joint venture were the primary drivers of sales declines compared to last year. For the full year dollar sales were $9.3 billion down less than 1% compared to last year. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, down 2% from fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of lower sales for the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. For the full year, volume was 5.1 billion pounds up 2% over the prior year. Selling general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were 7.9% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. For the full year, selling general and administrative expenses were 8% of sales compared to 7% last year. We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to be approximately 8% of sales for fiscal 2016. Advertising expense for the fourth quarter was $29.6 million compared to $22.4 million last year. Full year 2015 advertising expense was $145 million compared to $114 million last year. Equity in earnings of affiliates was $8 million in the fourth quarter versus $5.7 million last year. The increase is largely the result of improved earnings at our MegaMex joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $3.4 million last year. Year-to-date interest expense was $13.1 million up from $12.7 million last year. We expect interest expense to be approximately $14 million for fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 35.2% versus 34.1% in fiscal 2014. The year-to-date effective tax rate was 35% compared to 34.3% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 264.3 million and 264.1 million respectively. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fourth quarter and full year were 270.9 million and 270.5 million shares respectively. We repurchased 400,000 shares of common stock spending $24.9 million in the fourth quarter. We have 7.8 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million unchanged from last year. During the fourth quarter, we paid down $165 million of the $350 million short-term debt associated with the APPLEGATE acquisition. The remaining $185 million is expected to be repaid in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $47.3 million unchanged from last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $144.1 million compared to $159.1 million last year. The primary driver for the lower capital expenditures was our decision to delay the addition of capacity for Jennie-O fresh tray pack products in the face of lower turkey supply in 2015. We plan to move forward with this project in 2016 assuming there are no significant recurrences of avian influenza. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million as several projects in process during 2015 are completed in 2016, including the construction of a new plant in China and other projects Jim mentioned earlier. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $34.4 million compared to $32.9 million last year. For the full year, depreciation and amortization was $133 million compared to $130 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $130 million in fiscal 2016. As Jim mentioned earlier, we have established a fiscal earnings guidance range at $2.85 to $2.95 per share for 2016. This guidance includes a full year of contributions from our Diamond Crystal business. When a sale of the business occurs, we will provide updated earnings guidance. Fiscal 2016 also includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We have assumed the 53rd week will contribute approximately 1% of the earnings increase over last year in our guidance range. We announced a $0.16 per share increase to the annual dividend making a new dividend $1.16 per share. This represents a 16% increase on top of a 25% increase last year and marks the 50th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend rate. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions and answers. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question, we'll hear from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Hey, yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Jeffrey Ettinger : Good morning. Adam Samuelson : So I guess more detail on the margin, so let's say in the quarter and in the outlook the normalize ranges that you provided. Maybe in the quarter can you provide a little more clarity on, and especially in Grocery and Jennie-O, the very sharp year-over-year margin improvement that you saw, and maybe give a little more color on the drivers there? Was it simply timing of raw materials, manufacturing efficiencies, mix, a little bit more granularity there? And then on the long-term target, I appreciate you updating the long-term ranges, but I'm just trying to think about where you are today and especially Grocery, Refrigerated, and Jennie-O still running near at the high-end of the ranges that you've laid out and thinking about the contributors to earnings growth going forward, if you still think your margins are near the high-end of the normalized range? Thanks. Jeffrey Ettinger : Thanks, Adam, this is Jeff. So in terms of the current quarter, on the Grocery Products side, what we feel we're seeing is a return to normalized margins in terms of some of the raw material inputs coupled with some systemic changes in our overall operations environment, while we feel we have added efficiencies that will stick and we attribute that to the strong quarter they just generated and also that was why we have now increased that earnings guidance range by 1% on either end for the Grocery Products group. In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you'll recall we provided our best shot at what our second half adjusted guidance range would be in light of avian influenza and it pulled the range down to the 10% to 12% range. We certainly did see better returns in that in the fourth quarter on the aggregate for the half that turned out to be closer to 14%. They were able to do better on some of the dark meat-based items than we originally anticipated and they did a nice job of obtaining as much efficiency as possible in their operations.  In the case of Jennie-O Turkey Store, you will see, we really are not changing the upper end of the guidance range, but we did tighten up the bottom end like partially to their success and being able to achieve what they did this quarter.  The only other thing I guess I would add in terms of the long-term target ranges is clearly the Refrigerated Foods group with their performance this year broke out of the previous range and we were at a 5% to 8% range and they exceeded 9% this year. We have confidence in that business unit\u2019s ability to maintain margins and grow them over time from that level, and hence we've raised that guidance range to the 7% to 10% range.  Specialty Foods have seen improvement within the range as Jim indicated in his comments, but the overall results for the year are still within the guidance range we had previously provided, so we're leaving that unchanged especially with the DCB issue still lurking out there.  Overall, what we felt it added up to was a 100 basis points change in the total Company margins and so we're looking at now 10% to 13% as being what we think we can look at going forward versus the 9% to 12% we had previously provided. Adam Samuelson : It's very helpful, Jeff. And maybe just on Refrigerated piece, as you think look about the 200 basis points increase in the range there, would you attribute that to any particular part of the business? Bacon comes to mind as an area that's been seems to be particularly strong this year or really just manufacturing efficiencies and value-added mix, any more color there? Jeffrey Ettinger : It's been a strong performance all the way around and we think it's a sustainable progress with these brands. Bacon is clearly a shining spot for that group both on the meat products and foodservice side. While both of those value-added units had excellent results beyond just the bacon franchise as we mentioned some of the brands that did well in the release, pepperoni and party trays and entrees for the Refrigerated Foods retail group and then on the foodservice side pizza toppings and Fire Braised meats and other items. The affiliated part of Refrigerated Foods which is our Farmer John, Burke, and Dan's Prize operations, all had excellent years and contributed nicely to the results and they too as I mentioned with Grocery we've tried to attain some long-term efficiencies Refrigerated Foods certainly has not been quiet in that respect also. And so it all really adds up to that new level that they are now able to attain. Operator : And next we'll move on to Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc. Farha Aslam : Hi good morning. Jeffrey Ettinger : Good morning. Farha Aslam : Could you share with us your pork margin, basic pork margin estimates for this year and also if that's factored into your guidance and then the longer-term outlook what's kind of in your longer-term guidance? Jody Feragen : Sure. I guess everybody is pointing at me Farah. I have to take the pork's operating margin question. So certainly they were stronger than we expected in the fourth quarter and moving into the first quarter of 2016, they are pretty robust. I would expect as the year goes on that those will trend downward and we'll see modestly lower pork operating margins. Supply seems to be robust. Demand at this point in time is robust as well so that's basically what we factored into our business model going forward. Really this was the first quarter where we saw pork operating margins for Refrigerated business unit being a contributor to the year-over-year results and that's really been an improvement on their mix and the value-added products. Farha Aslam : And just as a follow-up. Could you talk about the recovery in the turkey business and the timing of that recovery? Jeffrey Ettinger : What we're seeing in terms of the supply challenges, fortunately it's been a benign fall thus far and there is obviously close watch even in terms a wild bird testing to make sure that we're not encountering the renewed presence of high pathogen avian influenza and kind of knock on wood thus far, we've not seen that. We were able to completely refill our barns, but as we talked about before, the primary turkey for most of our value-added items is our tom turkeys. It's a 22-week market cycle and so we will not been fully back to normalized volumes throughout the earliest of second quarter of fiscal 2016. That being said, the team has done the best job they can with making sure that we have the product allocated fairly among our customers in terms of what is available. And then ultimately as Jim indicated, if everything continues to go well and we don't have any further outbreaks, we should be in a position by second half of next year to renew our successful Make The Switch advertising campaign and restimulate growth for Jennie-O Turkey Store brand. Operator : And next we'll move on to Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital. Patrick Chen : Hey good morning. This is Patrick Chen in for Ken. A quick question about pork exports, we understand that China has opened its borders again to a couple of processing plants including yours. Just wondering what the broad implications are for your pork exports, your pork margins, and input costs for other parts of your business? Thank you. James Snee : Good morning, Patrick, this is Jim. Last year 2015 was a struggle with the pork exports especially in our International business. One of the bigger contributing factors was when Russia banned the imports from the European Union that supply had to go somewhere and it did find its way into the Asian market in general at similar favorable currency rates, and so more supply, favorable rates really were almost a perfect storm against us last year. Certainly the opening up of the China market and the approval of our plants, while we don't export pork directly into the China markets because of their ractopamine or lack of ractopamine requirement, what we do think it'll do though is really maybe redistribute the supply of the available product. And so as we're looking into 2016 for our pork exports in the International business specifically, we think sometime in the second quarter, the back half of the year, we'll be able to return to more normalized levels of our export business which is still a very important part to our overall International business. Patrick Chen : Great, thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : And next we'll move to Heather Jones with BB&T Capital Markets. Heather Jones : Good morning. Jeffrey Ettinger : Hey Heather. Heather Jones : I had a question first on your pork business. Talking about, it sounded like you have a pretty bullish outlook on the fresh pork side. And one thing that we've been hearing from a number of companies in the industry is that, you were looking at the USDA cutout? Just how that's trending? Is there seem to be a widening gap between what USDA is reporting on that cutout and what company are seeing on a blended basis? And I understand you guys have not a value-add, but just wondered if you're seeing a similar trend, so that maybe the USDA cutout is not as good proxy as it used to be for just trend for pork prices? Jody Feragen : I'm not familiar with where your data is coming from, but one of the contributing factors could be the fact that the drop credits that are not included in the cutout have significantly declined from normalized type level, so that could be causing some of it -- those are credits or items that aren't traditionally sold in the U.S. or byproducts of the productive process. Heather Jones : Yeah, I was talking about on the cutout specifically, but it sounds like you're not seeing same things. On your Jennie-O business, what do we understand Hormel is backwards integrated back to the greeters where it's quite a bit your competitors not, so it sounds as if Hormel's Jennie-O's volumes may return to normal borrowing another operate quicker [indiscernible] overall industry will return to normal from the volume perspective. It's what we understand basically on our conversations. And I guess my question is, I understand the difficult comparisons for the first half, but as we're thinking about late Q2 and Q3, I know a lot of your business is valued-added and more fixed price contract type of thing, but the part that is on the market, should we see some benefit from you guys having your volume return to normal quicker than the overall industry and there is still being benefit from some elevated pricing? Jeffrey Ettinger : Well, Heather. Let me I guess make sure we're on the same page in terms of the verticality of the Jennie-O operation. We don't actually engage in the breeder stock, we do have our own hatcheries, so we do have a direct egg source. Our egg experience from what we're seeing in the industry maybe a little bit better than the overall industry number, but that's as close as I can get to being able to compare ours to others. In terms of that the second half outlook, we've frankly been the leader when it comes to branded value-added products for some time. I mean we're the one that's advertising. We're a local company that creates innovative new products. We have a dedicated team that focuses on the sale those items into multiple channels, and so definitely if we have the supply in place, that team is primed and ready to renew our momentum of growing the value-added businesses indeed. I mean before this thing hit in the first half of this year, all three of our groups the Retail deli and Foodservice at Jennie-O Turkey Store, their value-added sales were all up double-digit, so they were really on a roll here and we would expect during the second half of this year, if we have the meat supplies available and can turn the advertising back on to renew that kind of growth. Operator : And next we'll move to Diane Geissler - CLSA. Diane Geissler : I just wanted to ask on Diamond Crystal. So you obviously took a charge there, I'm assuming that's in anticipation of potential sale. Can you help us just how big is that business and what are its topic contribution then so as we model out this year, we can kind of get an idea for what the potential dilution to your EPS would be? Jody Feragen : So I don't think we specifically called out any profitability numbers on that business and we will provide you the appropriate guidance when we do have a transaction to talk about. From the sales perspective, it's about $250 million to $260 million, without a margin structure that's generally lower than the guided range that we have further Specialty Foods segment. We'll try to help you when we have something to talk about. Diane Geissler : Okay. I appreciate just given quantification on the size of the business. And then Patrick ask about China, so you talked about the plant additional CapEx this fiscal year to finish the construction there. How do you think about the timing in terms of obviously for SPAM etcetera that's been a product that you had introduced [indiscernible] poll. Can you just kind of talk about what your plans are with regard to when the plant is up and running and how long you think it will take to get products, kind of out of the door and under shelves and just kind of the maybe a longer-term 12 to 24 months outlook on your business in China. Thank you. James Snee : Thanks Diane and this is Jim. Our business in China really has been performing exceptionally well here over the last couple of years. That team is really hit their strides. In terms of needed capacity, the sooner we complete this plant the better offer going to be. We are expecting the plant to be completed in the fall of 2016, so if we think about the September timeframe, and as a reminder that plant will be a combination of Refrigerated meats and also our in-country SPAM production as you mentioned. So that plant in the capacity that's going to be made available to our business in China. It's really going to keep us on the path of sustained growth that we've been able to deliver here the last couple of years. Business is very well developed both in the retail and foodservice channels, not only on the meat side, but with our SKIPPY business, and so as we think about it going forward we're exceptionally well-positioned to continue to grow the business in me instantly and were very excited about the synergies that will get within country production a stamina and being able to leverage them against what we've learned through the SKIPPY business. And so as we think about it going forward we're exceptionally well-positioned to continue to grow that business in meats and SKIPPY and we're very excited about the synergies that we'll get with the in-country production of SPAM and being able to leverage them against what we've learned through this SKIPPY acquisition integration, so lots of the letter great things coming out of China. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And next we'll move on to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Mario Contreras : So I wanted to clarify on the guidance for fiscal 2016, on the 53rd-week mathematically would expect that to add 2%, so given it's not going to add 1%. I'm just curious is that related to timing or some of that extra week profit going to be reinvested back into the business? Jeffrey Ettinger : Okay, Mario, this is Jeff. Our business is the hybrid business between the store grocery channel and in the protein base channels, and I guess the way we assess it is yes on the protein side when you have meat coming at you in the system, you should anticipate frankly a full extra week, you'll have full cost and frankly should deliver full margins. When it comes to the Grocery side of the business which impacts not only our Grocery product segment, but also our international piece is significantly Grocery base. Our experience in the past has been, non-buying programs or those types of items, you really don't get a whole extra week. A lot of them are on monthly programs and so forth and so we're just trying to provide the guidance based on what our best experience has been. I would say though there is a certain element of reinvestment going on. We've have [stuffing] up ad spend on an annualized basis, and this current plan no exception to that. We have a number of brands that we're excited about that we think we can continue to build momentum in the marketplaces, so there is a little bit of element in general of us making sure we're reinvesting in our brands. Mario Contreras : Okay, thanks for that. And then just one additional clarification there, corporate expense was a bit higher than its historical trend? Was there anything unusual there this quarter and what type of run rate do you think would be appropriate going forward that line item? Jody Feragen : I would expect that, well in the fourth quarter we really had some higher employee related expenses as we took a look at all of our incentive programs and made adjustments there. We also had some higher legal expenses for some activity that was going on there. On a normalized level, I think he could look at possibly 5% increase over where we finish this full year. That ends up being a spot where lots of miscellaneous adjustments, so it's little harder to forecast. Operator : And next we'll move on to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hey there. A great year, great two years in a row, so here is a question about turkey. I literally just bought our turkey at Stop & Shop $75, $3.12 a pound. I mean it seems like a shockingly high priced. Jody Feragen : Probably Jennie-O. Robert Moskow : First question, would it be cheaper the Jennie-O. The second question, I look at your pricing back half of the year, there was no pricing despite the fact that the industry is sort of volume constraint and I'm trying to think about next year for Jennie-O. What is the pricing kind of flattish and for next year, will it continue to be flattish? And then I'm still not quite sure, I understand the cautious guidance for the first half for '16 for Jennie-O if fourth quarter came in loudly above what I had forecasted and I understand the volume constraints, but can you give us an order of magnitude on the first half profit guidance for Jennie-O? Jeffrey Ettinger : I mean first of all, when whole bird pricing, I mean it's a relatively small percentage of the overall results of the business and you're also dealing with something that's very retailer specific and retailer dependent. I mean it ranges from apparently you hadn't experience where the retailer was certainly seeking to attain some margins out of their whole turkey sales, all the way to kind of the more historical treatment. Frankly there is a lot of retailers usually there is a lot sweeter and so you'll see a price out there and you might think that's breathtakingly low sometimes, that's not necessarily what our value was into them. It's up to the retailer to decide how to price the product. James Snee : In the aggregate we came up with as many whole birds as we could for this year given the shortages we were fronted with and allocated them out on a national basis. In terms of your question about pricing in general and the guidance, fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest quarter, most favorable feed conversions and so forth in your birds. You do have the added bump if you will of the Thanksgiving sales rolling through. We know we're going to be short product again in Q1. We're certainly going to try to perform as strong as we can. We're going to be comparing against a very robust performance by Jennie-O Turkey Store in Q1 and Q2 in fiscal 2015. So we're comfortable that Jennie-O will be a solid contributor to the guidance range that we've provided you on an aggregate basis with most of it coming in the second half of the year. Robert Moskow : Okay, but pricing like -- there is no pricing in Jennie-O right now and I imagine no pricing next year either and in the capacity constrained environment, I would have expected pricing to be higher. Is it because of those contracts in place with retailers or is there something else? James Snee : It kind of runs the game, Robert. In some cases you're dealing with product shortages. In a significant enough shortage position, you may end up having a raise of price of what you have left. There are other aspects or other portfolio that you are on more of a contract basis or on a committed basis, so it's just kind of ends up blending out to the position you're seeing. Clearly there have been a steep increase in the commodity turkey pricing, but I think as we've talked about in the past, even in years and we're not sure of turkeys, we're not really a net seller of breast meat at commodity meat markets, and so these very lofty $4 and $5 rates that you're seeing on the commodity breast side that's not something we're able to enjoy in our sales. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff for any additional or closing remarks. Jeffrey Ettinger : Well, thank you very much. I just want to conclude by saying that I'm proud of the excellent quarter and full year performance by our team as we achieved record earnings for a 10th straight quarter. It's an extraordinary experience of our employees throughout the Company and that's such a key factor to our ability to consistently deliver strong results for the Company. On behalf of this team, I want to wish all of you Happy Thanksgiving, and thank you for joining us today. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Executives: Jon Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, CAGNY Co-Chair  Jeff Ettinger - Chairman and CEO Jody Feragen - CFO Jim Snee - President and COO Jana Haynes - Director, IR Analysts : Farha Aslam - Stephens Inc. Rob Moskow - Credit Suisse-North America Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Jon Feeney : Good morning everyone. Once again, I\u2019m Jon Feeney, CAGNY Conference Co-Chair. And once again, I have the pleasure of introducing Jeff Ettinger, Chairman and CEO, Hormel Foods. But first, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank Hormel for hosting lunch today, featuring many of their leading branded retail and foodservice items, that\u2019ll be immediately after this presentation. Hormel was nice enough to move up their strong earnings release this morning for this presentation, which you probably saw this morning, just like they\u2019ve been nice enough to lead the industry in returns for the past 15 years and to grow dividends every year for the past 50. For 125 years, they\u2019ve been the protein Company everyone else would like to be. And through the recent acquisitions like Skippy and Muscle Milk, they\u2019re very quickly becoming the food and CPG company everyone would like to be. Today, their CFO, Jody Feragen will cover the highlights of their earnings in lieu of an earnings call first, while both Jeff and recently named President and COO, Jim Snee will follow up and focus on their long-term strategic efforts, of course followed by your questions. So, Jody, welcome. Thank you, and take it away. Jody Feragen : Thank you, Jon for that introduction. Before we get started this morning, I need to remind you that certain statements will be forward-looking and they are based on current conditions. And I would refer you to the risk factors in our 2015 annual report. Additionally, 2015 results are non-GAAP numbers that exclude certain adjustments and those too are detailed in the annual report and also in the back of the presentation deck that you received when you walked in today. As Jon said, we did wait to deliver our record quarter for this morning, $0.43 per share, our 11th consecutive quarter of record earnings. And we were pleased that four of our five business segment contributed to the growth. Now, sales were down 4% due to lower pork markets as well as the turkey harvest supply issues that we\u2019ll talk about later. You\u2019ll note that the earnings per share and all the earnings per share numbers in the presentation have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split that our shareholders approved on January 26th and became effective on February 9th. So, taking a look at the segments, Grocery Products segment operating profit was up 26%, really benefitting from improved operational and supply chain efficiencies. In the first quarter of 2015, we rationalized our plant in Stockton, California and moved that production into other facilities. So, they\u2019re seeing a nice benefit from that and they\u2019re also winning with favorable raw material costs. Sales were down 4%, as we saw some softness in the canned meats area but we were really pleased with the results of our HORMEL bacon toppings, our CHI-CHI foods products and our Wholly Guacamole items. Refrigerated Foods had an outstanding quarter, segment profit up 65%. And really, it was great improvement -- a great performance across all our value-added businesses as well as strong pork operating margins. This segment also benefitted from the inclusion of the Applegate Farm operations. That was the business we acquired in July of 2015 and it continues to perform as we expected. I think you\u2019ll hear a little bit more about that later in the presentation today. Sales were up 2% on a 5% volume increase as the higher sales were offset by those lower pork prices. We did see nice gains in our HORMEL refrigerated entrees, our HORMEL party trays in the retail side as well as OLD SMOKEHOUSE bacon and FIRE BRAISED meats from the foodservice side. Jennie-O Turkey Store operating profit was down 2% for the quarter, really still recovering from the impact of highly pathogenic avian influenza that hit our farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota midway through 2015 last year. We are seeing improved performance and we would expect that by the end of our second quarter, they should be back at normalized operations, providing we see no further widespread outbreaks of AI. And then they\u2019ll also benefit from lower feed costs as grain prices have been lower. Sales were down 15%; volume down 23% and really that was just a supply issue, as we are vertically integrated in the turkey side of the business. Specialty Foods operating profit was up 44% on the 10% decline in sales. They too benefitted from favorable input costs and also some supply chain efficiencies, as we look to rationalize the MUSCLE MILK production into some of our existing facilities. We were pleased with the growth of our MUSCLE MILK products, particularly the ready-to-drink items. But, we did see decreased sales of some contract packaging sports nutritional items that were at a low margin basis. International saw 1% increase in operating profit on a 7% decline in sales. We were very pleased with the strong SKIPPY sales, both on an export basis as well as SKIPPY sales within our China operation, but they couldn\u2019t offset softer pork exports as we continue to battle challenging market conditions. Our China results were lower year-over-year. First quarter 2015, we were able to import SPAM and sell that in the domestic marketplace in China, that\u2019s no longer an option, so they are up against those difficult comparisons. But, we are fully looking forward to our plants that we are building in China to provide us the opportunity to sell SPAM to that marketplace. Some other financial metrics that we traditionally go over on our call, advertising spend was $48.1 million, up nicely from last year; we would expect full year to be up low double-digits area. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% and we\u2019re expecting approximately 33.5% to 34% for the full year. Depreciation and amortization was slightly under $32 million while our capital expenditures were $33.5 million. As a reminder, we guided at the end of our fourth quarter that we were expecting approximately $250 million in CapEx, and you\u2019ll hear about some of the projects later in the presentation. From a market outlook perspective, we are expecting hog production to be up about 2%. And while we benefitted from historically high favorable pork operating margins in the first quarter, we would expect those to moderate as the year goes on. Turkey production, assuming no widespread outbreaks of avian influenza, expected to be up 5% to 6%. And as that production increases, we should see prices moderate in the back half. Grains will be favorable year-over-year versus 2015. And as a reminder, we traditionally looked to hedge between 25% and 75% of our needs on a two-year forward looking. We have a very strong balance sheet. The $185 million of short-term debt that was on the balance sheet at the end of our fourth quarter related to the Applegate transaction was repaid. And we now have $250 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet which we really believe gives us the opportunity to continue to look at all types of investments. And I believe we could have $3 billion of additional debt on our balance sheet and still remain investment grade. Our excellent earnings results coupled with our disciplined capital model has allowed us to generate cash flows over the last five years of 21% growth rates. And if you look at the trailing 12 months ended in the first quarter, we\u2019re up over 65%, so, certainly generating the nice cash flow. And our priorities have remained the same, pretty consistent year-over-year. We look to invest in our businesses as well as to return to our shareholders. We\u2019ve invested about $2.8 billion in growing our business, some of that organic being capital investment. We\u2019ll talk about adding capacity to meet some of the demand for our value added products, and then about $2.1 billion in strategic acquisitions. The way we look at these investments is the same regardless if I\u2019m adding internal capacity or looking at a strategic acquisition, we build the base case business model, we use a long-term cost of capital and we do a discounted cash flow, and we believe that that allows us to make the best decisions for our shareholders. Speaking of shareholders, we believe in returning to our shareholders our excess cash flow. Our share repurchase is a little more opportunistic given our ownership structure, but we certainly are pleased with our dividend results. And as Jon referenced, 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. Our Board of Directors approved a 16% increase for 2016 and our average growth rate over the near term has been about 18%, in excess of the excellent bottom-line that we\u2019ve been able to deliver, as we try to get a payout ratio and the dividend yield closer to our Pepperidge [ph] food peers. So, excellent earnings results; disciplined capital allows us to put up a return on invested capital that\u2019s in the top quartile of our peer group. And with that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jeff Ettinger. Jeff Ettinger : It\u2019s our pleasure to be with you this morning to be able to share what was an outstanding quarter for Hormel Foods, and to be back at CAGNY after a few year hiatus and what you know what we\u2019ve been up to and what our priorities are going forward in terms of our brands and our team. As Jon was nice enough to mention, we\u2019re also hosting the lunch. So, we don\u2019t have a formal Q&A session after this but we\u2019ll all be available including others of our team during the lunch to take any additional questions you might have. One of the questions you could ask anybody in there is what does 5 and 10 mean to Hormel Foods. 5 and 10 have been our consistent goals within our corporation for the past 10 years, what we strive to achieve 5% revenue growth each year and 10% earnings or operating income growth. These are among the most aggressive goals within the food industry and even in our past presentations here at CAGNY that Jody and I have done, you should have consistently seen that these were our goals at those sessions as well. Importantly, we\u2019ve really done a nice job at achieving those aggressive goals. Our track record over the past five years on the topline is indeed at that 5% rate. We\u2019re now a $9.3 billion Company. And in area of earnings, we\u2019ve actually been able to exceed our 10% goal with the 12% CAGR capping out last year. What I want to share with you is kind of how we\u2019ve done that and a little bit of our thinking behind some of the decisions we\u2019ve made that have led to these types of results. We\u2019ve grown our Company on a topline basis and certainly significant profit contributions in three ways : Through M&A through new product innovation; and by continuing to expand our traditional product portfolio. In the area of M&A, we certainly had an active decade during the 2000s with a number of deals, somewhat smaller deals ranging from about $15 million to $200 million in deal value, over a broad spectrum of products. This array of deals enabled us to gain confidence in our ability to integrate and to look for new prospects but as we headed into the most recent timeframe, we kind of did make a couple of changes in our mentality toward acquisitions. We look for somewhat larger deal as our Company\u2019s getting bigger and in order to move the needle, we recognized we needed to look at bigger opportunities. And so, four out the five largest deals in the Company\u2019s history have come in the past four years. Wholly Guacamole at a total deal value of north of $200 million counting, an earn-out off, Skippy which we completed in 2013, a $700 million deal, Muscle Milk in 2014 was a $450 million deal and then most recently Applegate at $775 million. In addition to the deals being larger, we also looked critically at our portfolio and said, you know, I mean our core portfolio, we love a lot of the items that have been with us a long time and we\u2019re continuing to grow those items but honestly, it was a very American dominated portfolio with a lot of kind of traditional American food type items. Neither SPAM nor bacon items are probably going to be accused of being health oriented items any time soon and we recognized the consumers are more and more on the go, and our portfolio is really dominated by kind of sit down meal type items. So, all four of these acquisitions, and Jim\u2019s going to give you more detail on these, really are aimed at making our portfolio more global, more multicultural to add that element of health and holistic attributes and to provide on the go solution. Another decision you have to make when you acquire something is, how are you going to run this operation? We\u2019re still headquartered in Austin, Minnesota, a small town, two hours south of Minneapolis and indeed for some of these properties, particularly businesses or brands that we buy from another company or corporation, we tend to fold those and run those in-house. And so that was true of the domestic Skippy business, it was true of the Lloyd\u2019s barbecue line, it was true of the Country Crock Side Dishes who are now named Hormel Side Dishes. For some of these recent deals however, we have looked at those deals and said look, to really optimize the consumer connection and the uniqueness of some of these opportunities provide, we may need to look at running them a little bit differently. We still try to find ways to harmonize and gain synergies on a back room basis in every chance we get. But in terms of that direct to consumer connection point, for example Skippy in China, it came at the plant in China from which we sell to most of Asia, and so they are Chinese team that have been in place for over 15 years, that\u2019s taken on that business. Muscle Milk had a strong presence in Northern California, was kind of a young vibrant market and we wanted to maintain that, so we\u2019ve left that team there supplementing with a few folks in the Hormel organization. MegaMex into which we put the Wholly Guacamole acquisition is a joint venture. Our partners are two companies from Mexico, Grupo Herdez and Grupo KUO. And so on a combined basis, we run that entity from Southern California, which certainly is a hot market for understanding the Mexican food experience. And then very recently with Applegate, this team and this business really had both a unique supply chain of organic and antibiotic free natural products and also very strong consumer connection to -- and unique set of folks that we wanted to make sure we preserve that connection. So in order to go with the theme of kind of providing you with a little bit of a behind the scenes mentality of what we\u2019ve been seeking to do, I want to share with you now a video that kind of depicts what the Applegate experience is all about from the mouths of their team members.  [Audio/Video Presentation] New product innovation is also a key element of our growth story at Hormel Foods. Indeed, our founder George Hormel founded the Company on the principle of innovate, don\u2019t imitate. We\u2019ve had a number of notable successes over the years including our party trays franchise, NATURAL CHOICE, our Bacon 1 items for the foodservice trade. Within the retail world, we recently were recognized as an IRI Pacesetter for three of our items. This is a tracking of the last 52 weeks sales via the IRI organization of the best selling new products in the United States. And so, we were pleased that our MUSCLE MILK Pro Series, our REV snack wraps and our Wholly Guacamole minis all made this list. In the nature, [ph] the editors from Progressive Grocer magazine bring in products from all over the country and have their editors try these items and see what they are excited by. And we were excited to see that we had eight items from our overall organization, ranging from Farmer John to Jennie-O Turkey Store, to our meat products group to our grocery products group that made this list. The third area of growth I mentioned in top of M&A and innovation is continuing to emphasize the growth of our core items. More often when we\u2019re talking to the press, we\u2019re kind of known as Hormel \u2018maker of SPAM\u2019 still, so that\u2019s a long term core item we\u2019ve had. And I\u2019m going to share [ph] a secret, SPAM is still growing it. It\u2019s growing at 3% GAGR over the last five years in the U.S. and a 7% CAGR outside of the U.S. But in addition to SPAM, we own a number of other items within the portfolio that we\u2019ve been able to create really nice household penetration growth, ranging from our flavor bacon portfolio to HERDEZ authentic Mexican sauces to Jennie-O Turkey Store lean ground tray pack and chubs [ph] items to our Hormel pepperoni items. And the story is a little bit different for each of them in terms of what\u2019s driven that growth. For the flavor bacons, these were items that frankly we borrowed from our foodservice team. We came up with these innovative flavors for the restaurant trade and they were so popular there that we created retail versions of the items. For HERDEZ it\u2019s been geographic and consumer expansion, as authentic Mexican food is going into more and more cities in the U.S. and is seen as an authentic eating experience by more and more consumer who are working for that kind of local item. For Jennie-O Turkey Store, it\u2019s been the advertising, the Make the Switch campaign that has enhanced awareness of overall Jennie-O and has enabled us to ride the wave the consumers looking for more health oriented items. And even pepperoni minis that have been around for a 100 years, we\u2019ve been able to grow households recently. And in that case, I think recipes have driven a lot of it, as we\u2019ve encouraged consumers to put pepperoni pieces and slices on many more items.  I mentioned to you that this growth of our overall company, the top-line where all the items I just mentioned and that some of the bottom-line has come from the enhancement of these portfolio items but clearly some of that 12% CAGR on the bottom-line has come from cost efficiency gains. We don\u2019t tend to have kind of active projects going on; we try to really watch this on a continual basis. Another one of the founding principles of George Hormel was continuous improvement, always seeking to find a way to do the job a little bit better day-in and day-out. One of the ways this manifests itself is through our best of the best projects. We encourage our teams from throughout the corporation to have projects during the course of the year to offset inflation and maybe even be able to provide enhanced bottom-line returns as well. We had over 1,500 such projects during the past year. And these projects drive cost control; they allow us to better utilize our raw materials; they can create yield improvements; and they can allow us to better utilize our capacity. An example of those enhanced returns within two of our most vertical oriented units are seen in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, as over the past five years Refrigerated Foods has enhanced our overall operating income percentage by 250 basis points, and at Jennie-O Turkey Store that\u2019s about 590 basis-point increase. One other way to see the leveraging of efficiency is the growth versus the kind of the overhead within the Company or the corporate team. So, we\u2019ve grown the top line in the past five years at an aggregate 28% but our corporate staff team during that same timeframe grew at 14%. So, 50% leverage opportunity there. Or if you look at overall sales, the CAGR of 5.11 versus SG&A without advertising at 3.95, again about a 20% leverage point -- versus our sales versus that total cost picture. One last aspect of the secret behind Hormel Foods that I\u2019d like to share with you really relates to our team, where we are -- I mentioned to you we\u2019re in a small town in Minnesota; we\u2019re little bit of a throwback in that regard. When someone joins our organization, they tend to join it for a life and indeed our average tenure of our officer team at Hormel Foods is 26 years, that\u2019s not 26 years of industry experience, that\u2019s 26 years of experience at Hormel, which I think does make it somewhat unique in the industry. We had our chance of -- I saw the earlier presentation from General Mills and they\u2019re celebrating their 150th anniversary, which is fantastic. Hormel Foods is celebrating our 125th anniversary this year. And in anticipation of that event, I had a little gathering here recently with my two predecessors in the CEO, President roles at Hormel Foods, Joel Johnson and Dick Knowlton. We were taping some things for that 125th anniversary celebration and then we kind of had a little breakfast session for some of our favorite SPAM recipes and had a chance to share some of the things we thought have made the Company strong over the last few years. And I want to share a couple of minutes of that video with you right now. [Audio/Video Presentation] So, between Dick, Joel and I, we\u2019ve been President of the organization for the past 35 years; it\u2019s been our privilege to do that. But this last October we had an exciting announcement, it was the announcement of just the 10th President in our Company\u2019s 125-year history. Jim Snee. And let me tell you a couple of things about Jim. So, this maybe the first time for many of you to be introduced to Jim. Jim also has 26 years of Hormel Foods. So, he hits the average on the nose; so, we don\u2019t have to change that slide with him moving into this. He came up to our organization from the foodservice, sales and marketing team. He ran three different regions for our foodservice team. Jim was then asked to head up our corporate-wide purchasing function; after that he was inaugural Vice President of our affiliated foods group within Refrigerated Foods, running Farmer John, Burke and Dan\u2019s Prize. And then for the past four and half years, he lead the International team. And during his tenure, his team grew segment profit for international from $26 million to $88 million. Without further ado, I\u2019m going to bring Jim up to podium, and he\u2019s going to share with you many of the exciting initiatives we have going forward. Jim Snee : Thank you, Jeff. First, since this presentation is doubling as our first quarter earnings call, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to update all of you on our outlook for the rest of 2016. And during our fourth quarter conference call, we set our 2016 earnings per share guidance at $1.43 to a $1.48 per share. And those numbers are adjusted for the recent stock split. Now, while sales growth will continue to be challenged, as we navigate lower pork markets and the reduced turkey volumes at Jennie-O, especially through the first half of the year, we do expect our earnings to continue to be favorable. And our strong earnings performance in the first quarter led by Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products, Specialty Foods as well as improvements in our Jennie-O Turkey segment, as we recover from the turkey supply pressures, has given us the confidence to raise our guidance for the full year to $1.50 to $1.56 per share. And that represents a 14% to 18% increase over 2015. Now, while the Jennie-O Turkey Store business is still recovering from the impact of avian influenza last year, production volumes are expected to return to more normalized volumes by the end of the second quarter. And that will position them for strong growth in the back half of the year. Now, this expectation for normalized production volumes does assume that we do not have any new outbreaks of avian influenza in our operations, which are located in Minnesota, and Wisconsin. We look for continued favorable input cost for our Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segment. Refrigerated Foods will also benefit from strong pork operating margins. However, we do expect those pork operating margins to moderate as the year progresses. Specialty Foods should continue to benefit from an improved mix of higher value added items as our Muscle Milk franchise grows and we shift away from some lower margin business in other parts of that segment. That team\u2019s done a nice job capitalizing on operational efficiencies between our existing Century Foods business but also our recent acquired CytoSport business. And we expect Specialty Foods to continue to benefit from those efforts. And we do expect our International segment to be able to deliver improved results as the year progresses with improved export sales of both SPAM and SKIPPY. Now in terms of total Company performance, one of the reasons we\u2019re able to consistently set and hit our aggressive long-term growth goals is the balance that\u2019s built into our business segments. And when you put it altogether, our business model supports growth that exceeds the average for packaged food companies but is also inherently less volatile than our protein peers.  Now, in the first quarter, you\u2019ve heard it several times, we certainly are pleased to post another record in terms of earnings which grew at a significant double-digit rate with four of our five segments delivering earnings growth, really demonstrating our balanced model. But the long term success of this model really is borne out over time, as we\u2019ve delivered year-over-year earnings growth in 27 of the past 30 years. And its financial consistency\u2019s not only due to the diversity across the business segments but also the balance built throughout our business model. And so, we have product offerings that are both protein centric but also packaged foods and that has really served us well over time. And the deep investments that we\u2019ve made in both our pork and turkey supply chains, allow us to better control the quality and consistency of our products and remove costs from our system. This is balanced by our position of buying other key inputs such as peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes on the outside. And that reduces our exposure to potentially volatile growing cycles but it also minimizes our capital investment. And we have a very strong presence in both the retail and foodservice channels which allows us to serve consumers with meal solutions, both at home and away from home. And both our retail and foodservice businesses are strengthened by our dedicated sales force that concentrates exclusively on our family of brands. We have a strong sense of financial conservatism that serves the Company well. And as you saw earlier from Jody, we certainly have a strong balance sheet that gives us great flexibility. Now, this conservative nature is complemented by a relentless pursuit of innovation that\u2019s allowed us to maintain relevancy with consumers. And it drives our success in both process and product improvement. So, this right balance allows us to prosper in various commodity cycles, and our diversified portfolio helps insulate the business in various market conditions. And we have purposely prioritized our investments to expand the growth platform that we think positions our Company for long term growth, while complementing our existing portfolio of very strong brands, ultimately creating a platform of foods that fit the many consumer needs. Now, even with the faster growth that we\u2019ve seen in our International business over the last several years, we acknowledge that our business is still primarily a U.S.-based business but we continue to seek opportunities to expand our global footprint. We also view multicultural items with new and adventurous flavors such as those items that you\u2019d find in our MegaMex portfolio of items as a strong growth platform. We believe there are more opportunities to expand our multicultural food offerings going forward. Additionally, our innovation and acquisition efforts have been focused on delivering foods that fit today\u2019s busy, on the go lifestyles and the growing interest in products that are not only nutritious but has significant holistic attributes. So, now let\u2019s take a deeper look at each of these platforms. Our International business has achieved significant top-line growth over the last five years. We\u2019ve seen a 15% compound annual sales growth rate. And this segment is built on some long standing partnerships that we have with Purefoods in the Philippines, CJ in South Korea as well as a very a well-developed export business with iconic brands like SPAM and SKIPPY. And in China, we\u2019ve developed businesses in both foodservice and retail channels, leading to our decision to expand production capacity in that country. We broke ground this past April on our new production facility in Jiaxing China that will be completed by the end of calendar 2016. This facility will not only produce refrigerated and frozen meat items but it will include in-country SPAM production, allowing us to manufacture SPAM family of products in-country for the first time in our history. And this significant investment will give us much needed capacity and allow us to meet the growing demand for our products in China from both consumers and foodservice operators. Now, while we\u2019re pleased with the great work that our team has done to deliver this organic growth, we continue to seek opportunities to increase our global exposure in a more meaningful way. I want to spend some time this morning, talking about some specific brands in our portfolio that support our growth platforms and the efforts made by our team to deliver innovation to meet the needs of today\u2019s consumers with food best fit their lifestyle. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we have had and will continue to have aggressive expectation to grow our business at a rate of 5% on the top line and 10% on the bottom line. The brands I\u2019ll be highlighting today are going to be key drivers to support this aggressive growth trajectory. So, the Jennie-O has become a clear market leader through our team\u2019s efforts to build awareness. Their innovation and marketing efforts have led to 15 different items that hold the number one or number two market share position in their respective categories. And their Make the Switch advertising campaign highlighting turkey\u2019s versatility as an alternative to beef has been a huge success for the brand, driving both awareness and trial. Consumer awareness for Jennie-O brand now exceeds 95% and it is driving purchase intent and share growth as consumers continue to look for fresh, nutritious meal solutions using Jennie-O Turkey products. In addition to the growing demand for these Jennie-O Turkey products, we believe our fresh supply chain focused on ground turkey is the best in the industry. And these efforts show up at the retailer, as Jennie-O share of ground meat business has shown fantastic growth over the last five years. We hold the number two item in the retail exactly meat category, the only turkey item in the top 10. We have worked hard to achieve that success and we have great retailer support, as they recognize the importance of these types of items and their growing demand from consumers. The healthy attributes of the Jennie-O Turkey product portfolio, our brand leadership and our rapidly growing share of the ground meats category position the Jennie-O Turkey segment to be a strong growth driver for our business for many years to come. Now WHOLLY GUACAMOLE is part of our MegaMex portfolio of brands, and it\u2019s another brand that meets the growing demand from consumers for fresh, natural, fun organic products. This cool, on trend brand holds a 42% market share in the refrigerated guacamole category. and much of that growth has been built through digital media campaigns in conjunction with a strong social media presence and aligns well with our targeted growth areas with its healthy and holistic attributes. And of course, it has multicultural appeal. And from an innovation perspective, our introduction of WHOLLY GUACAMOLE minis has been a huge success as it\u2019s made this great product easy for consumers to take on the go and have anytime, anywhere they want. So, when we acquired the SKIPPY brand in 2013, we knew there were immediate opportunities to capitalize on the brand\u2019s existing recognition among consumers. We were able to make early distribution and share gains commensurate with the SKIPPY brand position. We also knew that we could grow the brand by going back to the basics with the commitment to advertising and innovation. And when we looked at innovation, we were not only looking for close in ideas but we wanted to bring to consumers the great flavor of SKIPPY beyond the jar. And we were able to do that with the introduction of SKIPPY P.B. Bites. It\u2019s a terrific combination of SKIPPY peanut butter with a pretzel or peanut butter center for a delicious protein infused snack that\u2019s perfect for on-the-go and anywhere snacking. SKIPPY peanut butter also enjoys the leading peanut butter brand from a natural perspective, allowing us to provide more choices for consumers. And while the team has done a lot of great work since the time of acquisition, we believe that there\u2019re still many opportunities to grow and innovate with this iconic brand. Now, our Specialty Foods team is capitalizing on the 2014 acquisition of the Muscle Milk brand. Muscle Milk holds the number one market share position in the ready-to-drink protein beverage category. And they\u2019ve also been able to reinvigorate the brand\u2019s innovation efforts, introducing new items like MUSCLE MILK Pro Series and MUSCLE MILK organic products. With innovation even more critical in this fast growing protein category, our team has developed a robust pipeline of exciting innovations that we\u2019ll be sharing with you in the months to come. We\u2019ve also been able to leverage our team\u2019s capabilities to significantly expand distribution of Muscle Milk products with traditional retailers. And we expect our Muscle Milk franchise to continue to grow this premium protein category well into the future. We got a peek at the Applegate brand earlier but I can tell you that we are still very excited about the addition of this great Applegate business to our portfolio of strong brands. Applegate is the number one brand in the natural and organic value-added protein category. And the acquisition was perfectly aligned with our interest in adding brands that resonate with consumers that are younger and more socially engaged. This acquisition has also expanded our distribution into the natural and specialty foods channel. It\u2019s provided us a faster path to creating a significant presence in this high growth attractive margin segment. It also affords consumers more choice, providing access to foods that fit the demand for more holistic products. Now, as we anticipated and we communicated when we announced the acquisition, our team continues to work on securing supply to meet the high demand for some of our Applegate products. The team continues to deliver nice growth with chicken-based products such as our Applegate natural breakfast sausage and Applegate organic and natural breaded chicken. I believe Jody said it earlier, if not, I\u2019ll say it for the first time that I\u2019m pleased to share with you that our Applegate business continues to perform in line with our expectations. And so, our approach of supporting our core items, driving innovation and strategically investing in acquisitions has allowed us to create a product portfolio that resonates with consumers of all ages, foods that fit many different lifestyles. So, many of our core brands have been well-represented in shopping carts for years. Our efforts on new product innovation and acquisitions have been focused on keeping our products relevant with changing consumer needs and trends, brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Natural Choice, Applegate, Muscle Milk and Jennie-O have broad appeal with millennials and a younger, more socially engaged consumer. This broad and balanced portfolio of brands is another key to our long-term sustained growth. And these are strong brands. We have 30 -- we have over 30 brands that hold the number one or number two market share in their respective categories, helped in no small part by our dedicated sales team\u2019s effort to communicate the power of our brands and their value proposition in both the retail and foodservice channels. Many of these brands are familiar to consumers for generations. They\u2019ve grown and strengthened over time and we strive to keep them as relevant with today\u2019s consumer as when they were first introduced. And we remain committed to supporting these brands and strengthening these brands, and advertising is an important component. We expect a double-digit increase in our advertising spend this year on the heels of a similar sized increase last year. Now, I\u2019d like to show you an example of some of our most recent investments, which represents a nice mix of both traditional and digital media. [Audio/Video Presentation] We certainly have some creative individuals working across the Company on these ideas. Jeff shared with you earlier a slide sharing some of the great household penetration gains that we\u2019ve made over the last five years. And while yes, we have made a lot of gains, another reason we\u2019re optimistic about our ability to continue to deliver strong growth is that many of the products still have a long runway ahead of us. I spoke earlier about the growth in Jennie-O Ground Turkey products and they\u2019re only scratching the surface with a household penetration rate of 9%. Items such as Applegate sliced meats, Hormel Natural Choice deli meats, Wholly Guacamole still all in the single digits with great consumer demand for these types of items, and even our iconic brands such as SPAM, Hormel pepperoni and Skippy peanut butter have significant runway growth ahead of them. And Jody mentioned our CapEx plans earlier for fiscal 2016 of approximately $250 million. Now some key items in that plan are the China plant that I mentioned earlier as well as some production capacity expansion for select bacon item, including Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon which is an item that is developed for our foodservice group. Bacon continues to be on trend and it\u2019s been a great growth vehicle for us. We\u2019re also expanding production capacity for Jennie-O ground turkey products. Now, this was a project that we have scheduled last year but we put it on hold with the outbreak of avian influenza. So, we\u2019re just refreshing it this year. And then, not all projects are about production capacity or plant efficiencies. And to keep pace with our innovation efforts, new technology and to maintain our laser like focused on food, quality and safety, we are making a significant investment in our research and development facility, which will be on line at the end of this fiscal year. And so our efforts to innovate and keep our products relevant with consumers have delivered strong financial results. And clearly we\u2019ve been rewarded for those results in the marketplace. We\u2019ve enjoyed stock performance that exceeds the S&P 500 and an index of our food peers. In fact, an investment at the end of our fiscal year 2010 would have tripled by the end of our fiscal year 2015. And while we are pleased with this stock performance, our team understands that we must remain focused on those things that we can control. We will continue to concentrate on building our branded, value added portfolios and making the right investments today that will drive sustainable growth in our business over the long-term. So, thank you for your attention this morning. We are now prepared to take your questions. And I do want to introduce Jana Haynes, who is our Director of Investor Relations. Q - Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking the question. So, congratulations on another great quarter. Can you talk a little bit about M&A? Obviously your returns have been above and beyond any of your peers but your balance sheet is still under-levered; you mentioned $3 billion in dry powder. The last three deals on average have added I think 4% to your earnings growth on average. What do you expect M&A to add to your growth algorithm going forward? Jeff Ettinger : We talk about 5% and 10% but we\u2019ve said that that\u2019s inclusive of M&A. I think over maybe a 10-year timeframe, the M&A is in more like 1 to 1.5 of the 5. Over the last five years, it\u2019s been a little bit more robust as we have done some bigger deals. We clearly have the financial wherewithal to tackle more acquisitions. We\u2019ve talked in the past and if you look at even the recent ones, some are corporate properties, so SKIPPY came from a corporation; Lloyds. From time to time companies are changing their portfolio. And we will certainly look at items within those portfolios that makes sense to Hormel. But a number of our more successful acquisitions have been family-owned business that frankly we try to establish a relationship over many years with a hope that at some point if that family has made the decision to sell the business that we might be a preferred buyer. We certainly have a number of hooks in the water and keep looking for the things. We know we can handle financially, we also know we can handle in terms of the capacity of our Company to integrate and handle more businesses. Jody Feragen : And I think importantly is the disciplined model that we put around when we are looking at whatever our investments are and taking a long-term view because we do buy things that we intend to keep for the next 125 years. Jim Snee : And I would add that we would probably keep them tied to those growth platforms, I discussed. So, when we think about global multicultural, healthy holistic and on-the-go, those are going to be key drivers for us as we go in the future. Doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t look at a business that perhaps adds scale to an existing portfolio that we have but really we want to focus on those growth platforms in the years ahead. Jana Haynes : Farha? Farha Aslam : Results today really highlighted the success of your allocating raw material to the highest opportunity, particularly your Jennie-O Turkey Store had volumes that were down kind of 20% plus but your earnings were nearly flat. So, kind of as you look forward, what more opportunity do you see in both turkey and pork, going forward. Jeff Ettinger : I think from a turkey perspective, clearly it\u2019s exactly what you said. I mean the team has done a great job allocating those raw materials. But as we get in to the back half of the year, we will see that return to more normalized returns. We need to make sure that we\u2019ve got our business, our distribution back to where was pre avian influenza because there were some rationalization that had to take place. And so, we\u2019ve got the great fundamentals of the Jennie-O Turkey Store business. And now, if we can go back and put the supply on top of that we think that we are going to be well-positioned for future growth. On the pork side, again, it\u2019s a pork operating margins could have an impact in the back half of the year. But when you look across the Refrigerated Foods in total, we\u2019re talking about meat products, foodservice, a number of different businesses that all -- they don\u2019t all have the same direct impact. So, I mean we expect to be fine on the pork side. Jana Haynes : Rob Moskow? Rob Moskow : Thanks. Also I thought what helped the quarter were bacon margins, deli prices were way down and bacon retail seemed really high. Was that a big driver of refrigerated margin in the quarter, and is that also sustainable given the volatility in deli prices historically? Jeff Ettinger : That was a piece of it. I mean clearly if you look at the portfolio of items that we have available, whether it\u2019s Hormel pepperoni, bacon, certainly the Refrigerated Foods or the items in our foodservice group also has a bacon component to it as well. And so our team does do a good job of staying current on pricing, as it does, there is some volatility and fluctuation. So, I mean I think the margin management piece of it, the discipline our team, does a pretty nice job. And I would expect that we would keep that going forward. Rob Moskow : Just to follow up, in turkey, is the industry going to come out of this AI event in the stronger position than it was before because maybe some excess capacity came out? I mean your pricing is up at a time when all other proteins are down. Can you explain how turkey pricing kind of takes [ph] once all that? Jim Snee : I think turkey is kind of unique in the sense that it is a niche protein, even as greater job as our Jennie-O brand has done in proliferating the brand in the marketplace and adding these value added items, I mean it\u2019s not the lead item that the retailers going to feature in their ads, except for Thanksgiving. So, I think the pricing model for us is really fairly consistent one. As long as we build innovative items with true points of difference, we can attain a good margin with those. And we clearly want to support that with the advertising position. Hard to tell from a macro standpoint. I mean this year the whole industry is obviously going to be closely watching this spring to see if there are any further outbreaks. You\u2019re seeing cold storage stocks go up a little bit already. I think that frankly folks are holding to any surplus breast meat or other items they have in anticipation of a potential challenge. We didn\u2019t see any recurrence within our region in the fall. There was a recent incident in Indiana but was a fairly limited one of a different strain. So I think the AI dynamic is going to continue to affect the marketplace at least through the spring and then if it turns out we have a clean spring and we\u2019re kind of out of that mold, then things could change by next year. Jana Haynes : Mario? Mario Contreras : Mario Contreras, Deutsche Bank. So, I wanted to ask about your long-term targets; 5% sales, 10% earnings growth. It\u2019s obviously implying a decent amount of margin expansion over time. But, if we look at your specific segment margin ranges, you are already kind of at the high-end or even above the high-end in some cases. So, can you talk a little bit about where you expect to see that margin expansion come from over time? Jody Feragen : Well, certainly we\u2019ll look to do some of that leveraging on the corporate and the G&A side of things, like Jeff talked about. But really it\u2019s about focusing on what the consumers are looking for and trying to find the value-added products that fit within the growth platforms that we\u2019ve put out there. Some will come from one of the things that we -- criteria we look for when we\u2019re looking at M&A transactions or even those internal investments are -- we expect the margin profile over those investments over the long-term be accretive to the segments that they\u2019re in. So, lots of different things working towards those goals. Jeff Ettinger : As Jon mentioned in his introduction, we certainly have endeavored to shift the portfolio to become more and more of a prepared foods player but our aggregate margins are still well below the average of that universe. So, we think over time and we\u2019ll certainly move the segment margins as we see a logic behind that; we think over time the total Company margins can definitely migrate northwards. Jon Feeney : Well, thank you. I think that\u2019s all the time we have on the webcast. Just as a reminder, lunch is immediately after this. I believe Hormel management team will be available for your questions. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to thank Hormel once again for what is sure to be a great lunch and for their support of CAGNY, had a great presentation. Thank you.",

Jeff Ettinger : Thank you, Jana and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report record results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016. Earnings in the second quarter were $0.40 per share, up a robust 21% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% increase despite lower turkey volumes at Jennie-O Turkey Store and soft export demand in our international segment. We reached an agreement to sell Diamond Crystal Brands in the second quarter and completed the transaction in recent days. This business, which was part of our Specialty Foods segment, represented approximately $260 million of annual sales. While Diamond Crystal Brands performed acceptably, it did not fit our long-term strategic priorities. As a result of the transaction, there was a small goodwill impairment recorded this quarter to reflect the final sales price. Our Specialty Foods Group will retain Hormel Health Labs, a provider of nutritional foods and beverages developed specifically for individuals with special dietary needs, which was previously a part of Diamond Crystal Brands. We continue to ensure a smooth transition for the customers and employees of Diamond Crystal Brands. In addition to our earnings release this morning, we also announced the acquisition of Justin\u2019s LLC, a pioneer in the specialty nut butter category. The acquisition comes with the fast growing Justin\u2019s brand of natural and organic products, a strong management team, access to new customers and several manufacturing agreements. The deal is subject to the customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals in the United States and is expected to close within 60 days. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee who will provide additional details about the Justin\u2019s acquisition and also take you through each segment. Jim Snee : Well, thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. Since Justin\u2019s was founded in 2004, the business has experienced tremendous growth. Looking forward, we expect Justin\u2019s to grow at low double-digit rates from a starting point of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2017 net sales. Justin\u2019s will report into the Grocery Products segment. Justin\u2019s enhances our scale in the nut butter category complementing our Skippy brand positioning very nicely. The Justin\u2019s brand gives us a great platform in natural and organic specialty nut butter spreads, the fastest growing portion of the nut butter category. Justin\u2019s also further balances our portfolio of brands towards younger, more health conscious and on-the-go consumers with their pioneering squeeze packs, a portable snack that comes in all seven of Justin\u2019s nut butter flavors. We intend to leverage key Hormel Foods resources and supply chain, finance and R&D while leaving their mission and vision unchanged. We look forward to working with the Justin\u2019s team in Boulder, Colorado and finalizing the acquisition in the coming weeks. I will now take you through each segment. Grocery Products segment profit was up 21% for the quarter. Input cost tailwinds and improved plant efficiencies drove the gains. Sales were up 1% led by Skippy peanut butter, Hormel chili, Wholly Guacamole and our Herdez line of authentic Mexican products. Sales for our chunk meats business and Compleats microwave meals were down this quarter. Our Skippy peanut butter products had a great quarter. Our traditional jarred peanut butter continues to capture share in the marketplace as our sales team gains additional distribution. Our most recent innovation, Skippy P.B. Bites has had many early successes and key measures such as trial and repeat are meeting our internal targets. The company continues to leverage its iconic brands in new and innovative ways. And this past April, we opened the new 14,000 square foot Spam Museum located in downtown Austin, Minnesota. We invite you to come and visit our new family of friendly museum. Refrigerated Foods second quarter operating profit increased 13%, with sales up 7% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated Foods benefited from strong pork operating margins, the addition of the Applegate business and great results from our foodservice business. We saw growth from many of our value-added products, including retail sales of Hormel Natural Choice lunchmeat, Hormel pepperoni and Hormel party trays. Our foodservice value added products experienced solid growth led by brands such as the Austin Blues line of products, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats. When we announced the Applegate acquisition in 2015, one of our top priorities was to tackle the supply constraints we identified during the acquisition. While staying true to Applegate\u2019s mission of changing the meat we eat, we have secured additional supplies and the team is working to gain back distribution that was lost when supplies were pressured. Applegate remains on track to deliver earnings results consistent with our initial guidance for this business. Jennie-O Turkey Store\u2019s second quarter segment profit increased 20%, while sales decreased 4%. Results were impacted by the lingering effects of avian influenza as flocks lost in 2015 created shortfalls in operations and sales. Production volumes have now returned to normalized levels and we remain optimistic that avian influenza is behind us. However, the team continues to be diligent and heightened biosecurity remains a top focus. We remain focused on gaining back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak, but we did enjoy growth this quarter in our Jennie-O lean ground turkey, retail bacon and Oven Ready product lines. Our Specialty Foods segment reported an operating profit increase of 74%. The increase was aided in part by a favorable comparison to expenses last year related to the closure of the CytoSport production facility. Operational synergies captured in the current year within the CytoSport and Century Foods supply chain also contributed to the increase. Muscle Milk sports nutrition products posted excellent results in addition to launching many new innovative items, such as Muscle Milk protein smoothies. The gains made by our CytoSport team were offset by lower contract packaging sales, resulting in a 5% decrease in sales this quarter. International\u2019s operating profit decreased 33% and sales declined 17%. Weak exports of our Spam and Skippy family of products in addition to soft pork export markets contributed to the declines. Our China meat business had a difficult comparison to last year in addition to pressures from higher pork raw material costs. Our Skippy business in Mainland China experienced nice growth this quarter. We expect input cost tailwinds to continue for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. We look for these segments to continue driving year-over-year gains in sales and operating profits through increases in our value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store production is now at normalized levels and we are positioned to deliver growth in the back half of the year provided there are no significant reoccurrences of avian influenza. The team is investing in their fourth Make The Switch advertising campaign, highlighting turkey as an alternative to beef. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the second half of the year. The Specialty Foods segment may show year-over-year sales and earnings declines due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. Positive sales trends in the Muscle Milk brand and incremental sales from new innovative Muscle Milk products will offset some of the sales declines. With the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and to reflect the enhanced margin profile of CytoSport, we are increasing our segment margin guidance for Specialty Foods to 11% to 14%, up from the previously guided 8% to 11%. We look for the international segment to return to growth in the second half through increased export sales of our Spam luncheon meat and Skippy peanut butter products, along with gradual improvement in our China retail meats business. We continue to reinvest into our businesses through increased advertising and marketing support for brands such as Hormel pepperoni, our Spam family of products, Skippy peanut butter, Muscle Milk protein products and Jennie-O Turkey. As a result of the strong second quarter and continued confidence in our position heading into the back half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.50 to $1.56 per share to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the second quarter. Jody Feragen : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $215.4 million, up 20% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40, a 21% increase. Sales for the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion compared to $2.28 billion for the same period last year, a 1% increase. Turkey supply shortages and lower exports pressured sales during the quarter. Volume for the second quarter was 1.28 billion pounds, down less than 1% from the same quarter last year. As Jeff and Jim mentioned, we have reached an agreement to acquire Justin\u2019s LLC. The purchase price is $286 million. The transaction is structured to provide an ongoing cash flow benefit resulting from the tax amortization of the stepped up basis of assets. The net present value of this tax cash flow benefit is estimated to be about $70 million. We expect fiscal 2016 to include about four months of results from Justin\u2019s, with a slightly negative impact to earnings after factoring in the expected transaction costs and fair value adjustments. We estimate accretion associated with the deal to be approximately $0.01 for fiscal 2017. We expect to gain supply chain synergies that will be implemented over the next several years. We plan to finance this transaction with cash on hand and the short-term draws from our credit facility. Following the close, we will remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs. Advertising expense for the quarter was $48.8 million compared to $39.5 million last year as we continue to build on our brand investment. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.6% versus 34.6% in fiscal 2015. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33.5% and 34%. The basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 529.9 million compared to 528.1 million last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the second quarter was 543.8 million shares compared to 540.9 million last year. We repurchased 160,000 shares of common stock spending $6.4 million in the second quarter. We have 15.4 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66.4 million compared to $27.3 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $33 million last year. As Jim mentioned earlier, we raised our fiscal 2016 earnings guidance range to $1.56 to $1.60 per share. This guidance includes the sale of our Diamond Crystal business and the acquisition of Justin\u2019s LLC. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. We paid our 351st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 16, 2016 at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on volume trends in Refrigerated I think you reported 3% volume growth. Do you have the organic number if you strip that Applegate? I would guess it will actually be slightly negative, which would be a little bit of a deceleration versus last quarter and hoping to really understand kind of some of the mix there for where you are seeing the gains foodservice versus retail on some of the categories? Jeff Ettinger : I think your overall \u2013 this is Jeff, Adam, your overall math would be correct. It would have been slightly down absent the Applegate added sales. In terms of the differential between parts of the business, I mean we did talk about the foodservice had a really very strong quarter. So clearly, we are a little bit off on some of the retail brands, but it was a mixed bag. They had some nice success with some of their items, such as Natural Choice and party trays and pepperoni, but they did have a couple of the franchises that were down somewhat. Adam Samuelson : And as you look ahead, any visibility to an improving retail cadence going into the summer? And maybe a little bit more color, Jeff and team on the margin mix implications of that stronger foodservice growth if that\u2019s actually benefiting the margins meaningfully at this point? Thanks. Jeff Ettinger : Yes. I mean, I think not just for Refrigerated, frankly, we are looking at a more favorable environment for net sales growth for multiple segments next quarter. This quarter was still not quite where we would like it to have been, but it was not at the level of declines that the last two or three quarters had been. So, we are seeing the sequential improvement. And our outlook heading into the second half, for example, you\u2019ve got Jennie-O now with full volumes, so that will be a much more favorable picture. In terms of margins, who we have talked before about the foodservice is a solid contributor to overall refrigerated foods returns. The greater volatility piece more recently have been the processing margins were still quite strong this quarter although a little bit less than Q1. Operator : We will take our next question from Farha Aslam from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam : Hi, good morning. Jeff Ettinger : Hi, Farha. Farha Aslam : First question is on turkey, as your volume comes back how should we think about margins in that business and margins going into next year and longer term for turkey? Jim Snee : Yes, hi, Farha. Good morning. This is Jim. As we look into the future with our more normalized levels of production, obviously, the team is working hard to regain the distribution that was lost while supply was gone. And clearly, they were able to take advantage of some higher margins during that time. But as we look to the future, we would expect through \u2013 because of a couple of reasons. I mean, because of market conditions, but then also now that we are going to be able or have to sell all of the parts and not be able to take advantage of specific mix opportunities that our margins will return to the more normalized ranges, the guidance that we have provided. And I think we will start to see that in the back half of this year and into next year. Farha Aslam : And then also your margin outlook for your Refrigerated Foods division longer term, do you anticipate the increased processing capacity that\u2019s coming on in the U.S. hog and pork processing sector to impact margins for Hormel and how do you plan to kind of work around that? Jeff Ettinger : Farha, this is Jeff. I mean, that will be clearly one of the pieces we assess when we create our business plan for 2017. We are sticking with our margin guidance that we have provided for each of the segments at the beginning of the year with the one exception being obviously we did update the Specialty Foods segment as we said we would once we had visibility of the Diamond Crystal transaction being completed, but we recognized that at this point a number of our segments are performing quite strongly against the guidance ranges we have provided. And when we have a more clear outlook for 2017 and beyond we would provide an update to that. Operator : And we will go next to Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning. Jeff Ettinger : Hi, Akshay. Akshay Jagdale : Hi. First question is on Refrigerated Foods, so the pork operating margins that everybody tracks in May were even lower than what you saw in the second quarter. Is that \u2013 can you help us \u2013 I know it\u2019s difficult to look at those numbers and translate them to yours, but just generally speaking, what have you factored in into your guidance for the back half as far as pork operating margins go? Should they be similar to what we are seeing in the month of May, is that what\u2019s factored in or how should we think about that? Jody Feragen : Sure. I will take that one, Akshay. Yes, you are right, pork operating margins for May have been down about 40% from the averages in April and that\u2019s probably a little bit faster decline than we originally anticipated. But as we have stated on our first quarter call, we really do expect pork operating margins to be higher for the full year because of the strong start we have had in the first half, but moderating in the back half. So predicting exactly where that\u2019s going to go is not an easy task as you know. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And then can you talk a little bit more about Justin\u2019s, the sales number you quoted is much higher than what we see in the measured channels. So clearly, they seem to have a big presence in the non-measured channel. Can you give us a sense of the channel mix? And maybe more importantly talk about why sort of buy this brand when you already have a good brand equity in the whole nut butter category? Why couldn\u2019t you take that and extend it into some other categories that Justin\u2019s is in, for example? Thanks. I will pass it on. Jeff Ettinger : Yes, thanks, Akshay. This is Jeff and I will start with the question related to the sales number and then Jim is going to talk to the strategy piece. What we described for our anticipated sales for next year, for our full fiscal year, was in the $100 million range, but that\u2019s for next year and the brand is growing at a nice clip. They clearly do have sales outside of the reported channels. I don\u2019t have a precise quantification for you at this time in terms of the percentages. But clearly, that captures a good portion of them was been in the reported sales, but we should enjoy the growth next year. Jim Snee : And then Akshay, in terms of the strategy of the brand, we have had a lot of success since the acquisition of the Skippy brand. We have been able to obviously gain share, drive innovation, but also a lot of the research that we have done around the brand tells us that it\u2019s not extendable into the space where Justin plays today. And so Justin\u2019s affords us that opportunity to really be more complementary to the Skippy brand in a category that\u2019s a rapidly growing category. We know that it attracts a younger, more health conscious on-the-go millennial consumer. And the growth that the business has seen over the last several years, clearly, we are earlier on the growth curve than we have been with some other acquisitions, which we are quite frankly excited about. Operator : And we will go next to Heather Jones from BB&T Capital. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. On Jennie-O, you guys are adding capacity there this year. Is that correct? Jeff Ettinger : So, we have the favorable announced capital addition last year that was going to enable us to have more ground turkey capabilities. We suspended that last year when the avian influenza outbreak occurred and now we haven\u2019t turned that back on. So, it\u2019s not head capacity change, but it does enable us to support what\u2019s been a really nice growing franchise for us, the lean ground products. Heather Jones : So, could you help us understand how much that could \u2013 how much that new value added capacity could add to your growth rate? And thinking about 2017, you are comparing against an extra week. However, you will have a full year of \u2013 well, assuming AI doesn\u2019t recur, you have a full year of normalized volume. So, just wondering how we should think about \u201817 volume growth for Jennie-O? Jeff Ettinger : Heather, we really don\u2019t have any 2017 projections on either the top or bottom line at this point. But I would point out and we have talked in past presentations that, that ground turkey line is not a flash in the pan. I mean, that\u2019s been a long-term strong superior CAGR deliverer vehicle for us. That was why we went ahead and made the investment in the capital. And we are comfortable that now that we can guarantee supply on a broad basis. And frankly, the Make The Switch campaign that Jim mentioned in his remarks, I mean, that\u2019s the product line that\u2019s featuring. So how easy that is to use in tacos and in burgers for consumers. And so we do think that will be part of the growth story for Jennie-O, but we won\u2019t be able to give you a quantification of that until we have talked 2017 in November. Operator : And we will go next to Mario Contreras from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mario Contreras : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask first in international, if you can just give a little bit of detail around what drove the challenges in brands like Skippy and Spam? And then what gives you confidence if those will recover in the second half year? Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning, Mario. This is Jim. The biggest issue that we faced is we finally have felt the impact of the strong dollar in some of our export markets. It\u2019s not something that we have talked about in previous calls. But that really did impact both Skippy and Spam. There have been other supply issues that impacted our fresh pork business in terms of EU pork now flooding the Asian markets. So, it\u2019s really been a combination of things. But obviously, we have seen moderation in the strength of the dollar. We feel like we are positioned in terms of our branding, our advertising, our pricing that the second half will shape up to be a much better half on a comparable basis versus 2015. Mario Contreras : Okay, thanks. And then one other question, with respect to Justin\u2019s, do they own any of their own manufacturing facilities? And then beyond that, can you just give a little bit of additional detail around where you see potential synergies coming from there? Jim Snee : Sure. They have actually done a great job of building the brand and building the business since 2004 with a network of coal manufacturers. And our team is very comfortable with that approach. And as we think about where synergies will come from having already worked with them on due diligence, we believe supply chain, finance, R&D, there is a number of opportunities to gain synergies and really leverage the capabilities of our organization. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do plan to still run the business out of Boulder, Colorado. Operator : We will go next to Jeremy Scott from CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremy Scott : Hi, good morning. Jeff Ettinger : Hi. Jeremy Scott : Can you refresh us on your current mix of value-added versus commodity within Refrigerated Foods? Jeff Ettinger : I mean, it\u2019s in the 70% range. Frankly, it\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s been in that range for a while. I think the bigger effort in recent years has been moving products even further up the value ladder. So, there is raw bacon, there is flavored bacon, there is microwavable bacon, now we have Bacon 1 for our foodservice group. And each case provide an added element of convenience or unique flavors that also enable us to obtain a better margin return for our efforts in creating those products. Jeremy Scott : Okay. And just on the resilience within the Refrigerated Foods business has been exceptional. I was hoping you could share how you expect given where processing margins have come down, how do you expect the back half to trend relative to the front half? Jeff Ettinger : I mean, the back half will \u2013 should trend a little bit lower than what the first half was on an operating margin basis, but still very strong versus historical averages for the group. Operator : We will take our next question from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Yes, good morning everyone. Jeff Ettinger : Hi, Eric. Eric Larson : Just a couple of questions, back \u2013 one back on Jennie-O, Jeff and Jim, the \u2013 it\u2019s kind of related to Heather\u2019s question and adding some capacity to some of your individual product lines at Jennie-O, i.e., the grown turkey product lines, etcetera. Will you move into a net of buying position for your raw materials for that division eventually? Is that part of your strategy? And does that make sense to be diversified in that front rather than adding headcount? And then as kind of a follow-on, Jeff and I think we have talked a little about this maybe about a year ago, obviously, with that \u2013 with your operations so concentrated right in this upper Midwest area, when you had the flu impact, it obviously had a bigger impact on you as opposed to having more diversified potential operations in other parts of the country. Strategically, does it make sense to diversify your sourcing and maybe part of this is with more third-party sourcing to supply your Specialty Products? Jeff Ettinger : So, on your first question, I mean, realistically, we were probably a couple of years away from having to address adequate meat supplies before the AI hit. And of course, that\u2019s put us in a completely different mode for the past year and the team has done just a great job of surviving through that and positioning the brand well. So, that will come again in the future, where at some point we would have to assess, okay, do we engage in a more expanded program of buying in meat or do we look for further capacity capabilities of our own? And we will cross that bridge as that heads forward. On your second question, I mean, we did make an assessment of that. At this point, we have chosen to redouble our efforts within the region that we do operate to make sure that we are kind of on the front lines of understanding how disease issues like that might spread and what you can do to combat them. Ultimately, we feel we have a really nice position being within a 4-hour concentric circle of our operating plants and our production lines that allows for the maximum freshness of product. In general, absent last year\u2019s AI outbreak, this is a very favorable grain market with positive basis situation in most cases. And so overall, we like our position of being where we are. But clearly, if we were starting to have repeated incidents, we might have to reassess that at some point. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. First one is you said pork processing margins down 40%. On my tracking they are still up versus historical levels though and I think versus year ago, if you factor in like overhead or shipping costs being down, transportation costs are lower, that\u2019s also a benefit we have a service that does that for us, I want to know if you are seeing a similar thing? And then secondly on turkey, I continue to underestimate the profitability of turkey during AI and I just was hoping to get just a little more color on, once you get your volume back, do you think you go back to kind of a normal margin environment? Can it be a well above normal margin environment as a result of maybe some continued tight supplies out there? It\u2019s just a little hard to figure out what it\u2019s going to look like maybe you are having the same challenge when you get back to normal? Jody Feragen : Okay. I think I may have misled you by saying this down 40%. That was just the average so far in May versus the average in April. So, that was a sequential. You are absolutely right, we do expect pork operating margins to be above last year\u2019s in the back half of the year and somewhat higher than the historical averages. Robert Moskow : Right. Jim Snee : And then Rob on your second \u2013 to your second question, I mean, our expectation is, as the production level returns to normal at Jennie-O Turkey Store that these margins will fall in line with our normalized margin range. And it is \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of now that supply is back, we have seen some break in markets that we were able to capitalize on. And then clearly, the mix where we were perhaps being opportunistic in some of our buys, now we are going to have the supply of the birds and it\u2019s going to be our responsibility to make sure that we are clearing all of that volume, which changes the margin structure of the business slightly. So, we really do expect that it will be more normalized range as we head into the future. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Jeremy Scott from CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremy Scott : Hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. I was wondering if you could try again on Applegate, if you can share the run-rate of that business and if there has been any success in moving some of that into foodservice? Jeff Ettinger : This is Jeff. What we mentioned was that the business is performing consistently with the kind of earnings guidance projection that we provided on the business early on. We are looking forward to having that additional supply available and being able to start seeing the sales successes and the team placing items then that utilize that supply. But overall, I mean, the Applegate brand still is connecting very well with the consumer that we are seeking to partner with, with that kind of a brand and we are very pleased with where Applegate sits today. Jim Snee : And as we think about opportunities in the future for foodservice, I mean, clearly, we are working on making sure that we regain the space with the retail business first. And then as supply opportunities present themselves over time, certainly, foodservice would be an opportunity. Operator : And we will take a follow-up question from Akshay Jagdale. Please go ahead. Akshay Jagdale : Thank you. So, just following up on Jennie-O Turkey, just a modeling question, so how should we be thinking of the volume growth for the back half? I mean, there was some pretty massive declines last year, right, strong double-digits. So, should we be expecting double-digit increases in volume in the back half as we are lapping those? Can you help us with that? Jeff Ettinger : Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t have the precise volume for you, but definitely, when it comes to on a net sales basis, it will be solidly double-digit for both of the upcoming quarters. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And in terms of guidance, can you remind us how much the divested business was contributing to EBIT? So, how much of your guidance change includes negative impact on EBIT from the business that you are selling? And do you have any sense as to what Justin\u2019s might be accretive or dilutive in a full fiscal year? Jody Feragen : So Akshay, as a reminder, our annualized sales for the divested portion of Diamond Crystal Brands was estimated around $260 million. And we have never given guidance for subdivisions of our segments. But I think the comment that our $1.56 to $1.60 outlook for the full year includes not having the benefit of Diamond Crystal in the back half of the year as well as a slightly negative impact from Justin\u2019s and that\u2019s mostly driven because we will have transaction costs that we recognize currently as well as an estimated step up in some fair value of the inventory. So, the $1.56 to $1.60 is all-in. Jeff Ettinger : And then on Justin\u2019s we did provide that for our first full year operating the business, we are looking at $0.01 a share. And clearly, the business with the double-digit growth expectations and what we think is going to be an ability to attain synergies that we think we will be able to move up from there over time. Operator : We will take our next question from Robert Moskow. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : We got a lot of time. So, I am following up. I think you said there is a $70 million tax credit for Justin\u2019s. How is that factored into your accretion guidance and how quickly can you realize the benefits from that? And then the second question, Jeff, I think you mentioned some declines on certain products within the Refrigerated Foods segment, can you elaborate on which products those are and maybe the circumstances, are you seeing competitors discounting or is it just some products just need to be revived a bit? Jody Feragen : So I will take the tax benefit. That\u2019s just a reflection of the purchase price. It has no P&L impact going forward. So, we will get the benefit from a tax perspective, but it will not impact us on the P&L. But if you think about what we paid for the business, I would look at it as the $276 million \u2013 $286 million less the $70 million tax shield to get to kind of the price though, but no P&L impact and that\u2019s a cash flow that\u2019s generated over the next 10 to 15 years. Jim Snee : And then Rob, on the volume question, couple of the categories that were impacted we have got some what we would consider to be more commodity deli business that is more of an intentional decline, if you will and we are okay with that. The second category that has become very competitive is the bacon category. And over the last several years, our team has done a great job really driving our share, really developing our brand. And most recently, we are facing some competitive activity. And so we did see some short-term declines, but we remain very confident in the category and our ability to continue to drive our share and brand over time. Jody Feragen : I would d like to follow-up on a response we gave earlier too about the volumes in Refrigerated Foods. Without Applegate, they were slightly positive. So, tonnage was up for the quarter in Refrigerated, under 1%, but up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] It looks like we do have another follow-up from Akshay Jagdale. Please go ahead. Akshay Jagdale : Sorry, just one last one. This is for Jody. Can you talk a little bit about the free cash flow? It looks like working capital has been a little bit of a drag and so has the sort of other line. I am guessing that has to do with the acquisitions, but can you \u2013 because it\u2019s a deflationary commodity environment, so you would expect maybe working capital to be in a source of cash. But can you just help us give us a little bit more color on what might be going on there? Jody Feragen : So, we have had some \u2013 and I think you said free cash flow, so that includes stepped up capital expenditure base as well as we bring turkeys back into the barn. Remember, those animals are gone inventory the minute they are in egg, so those will be the two biggest drivers. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And currently, there are no further questions in the queue. Jody Feragen : So, thanks everyone for participating on the call today. And this is Jana Haynes last call as Director of Investor Relations. And we would like to thank her for her leadership of the Investor Relations function and wish her well in her new position as Vice President and Controller. And at the same time, we welcome Nathan Annis as the new Director of Investor Relations and look forward to working with him. Have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude your teleconference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at anytime.",

Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Rob Moskow - Credit Suisse Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal Jeremy Scott - CLSA Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Hormel Foods Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Nathan Annis : Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6 :30 am Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our Web site at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investor section. On our call today is Jeff Ettinger, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Snee, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Jody Feragen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jeff will provide an overview of the quarter and then Jim will comment on the segment results, outlook and guidance for fiscal 2016. Jody will provide detailed financial results for the quarter. The line will be opened for questions following Jody's remarks. As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional questions you are welcome to get back in the queue. And audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 10 am Central Time today August 18, 2016. The dial-in number is 800-533-7619. And the access code is 6233484. It will also be posted to our Web site and archived for one year. Before we get started with the results for the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 32 through 39 in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 24, 2016 for more details. It can be assessed on our Web site. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff Ettinger : Good morning everyone. Before we get into this quarter's results, I want to express my appreciation for all the contributions Jody Feragen has made to Hormel Foods. As previously announced, Jody will be retiring as CFO at the end of the fiscal year, so this will be her last earnings call. Jody has been a dynamite CFO. During her tenure, our team has delivered exceptional returns to our shareholders. She was instrumental in helping to complete over $2.7 billion in strategic acquisitions that have transformed our portfolio, and she oversaw close to $1.6 billion in dividends delivered to our shareholders. Jody also led numerous initiatives across the accounting, treasury, information technology, corporate development, and Investor Relations areas that have made our company better. Jody will be missed around the office and we wish her well in her well-earned retirement with her husband, Dwayne. Hormel Foods is fortunate to have a very strong bench of talent throughout our organization and the accounting and finance area is no exception. Jim Sheehan will assume the CFO position upon Jody's retirement with a deep knowledge of all areas of finance and accounting, emanating from his experience at Hormel Foods as Controller, Treasurer, and in numerous other roles. We have the utmost confidence in Jim's leadership and capabilities in this new role. Now on to the results. Earlier today, we announced record third quarter results of $0.36 per share, up 33% from last year. Sales for the quarter were $2.3 billion, up 5%, while volume was up 1%. Three of our five segments reported sales, volume, and earnings growth. Refrigerated foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and International, all posted excellent results. Grocery products enjoyed modest top line growth, though earnings were flat for the quarter. The specialty foods segment saw declines in sales and earnings due to the previously announced divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands in May. I would like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that our long-term goals of 5% sales growth and 10% bottom line growth continue to be a appropriate for our company. While we recognize any given year may deviate from these goals, we believe they are achievable over the long run due to our proven ability to build strong brands that resonate with consumers, innovate in categories where we compete, make strategic acquisitions and achieve balanced growth in various market conditions. For the past two years, we have also provided segment margin ranges. These ranges were intended to offer enhanced clarity to our business. Unfortunately, we believe they have added elements of confusion as they have not always been aligned with our primary performance goals of 5% topline and 10% bottom line growth, and they were not intended to be quarterly ranges. In light of this, we have decided to curtail the practice of providing segment level ranges going forward. However, we will provide an updated total company margin target during the fourth quarter call that we feel is achievable over the next three to five years. This long-term total company margin target will be consistent with and supported by our company growth goals. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee, who will take you through each segment. Jim Snee : Thank you, Jeff. Good morning everyone. Refrigerated Foods third quarter operating profit increased 24% with sales up 9% and volume up 3%. Refrigerated foods benefited from the addition of the Applegate business, favorable market conditions, and great results from our food service business. In addition, prior year results did include $8.6 million in Applegate transaction costs. Our food service value-added products showed robust growth, led by brands such as Hormel Bacon 1 Fully Cooked Bacon, Old Smoke House Bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats. We also saw sales growth from many of our retail products, including Hormel Natural Choice lunch meat and Hormel gatherings party trays. Jennie-O Turkey Store third quarter segment profit increased 59% on a 20% increase in sales. Production volumes returned to normalized levels during the quarter, which enabled the food service and deli teams to deliver strong volume, sales, and margin gains. We also saw nice retail sales growth in Jennie-O Turkey bacon. Our retail division at Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to gain back distribution that was curtailed during the outbreak last year, even as competitive activity has heightened in the broader ground meats category. International sales and operating profits both increased 5%. Strong exports of fresh pork, SKIPPY peanut butter, and SPAM luncheon meats all contributed to the increase in sales and earnings. Our China business posted strong earnings growth as SKIPPY peanut butter products more than offset declines in processed meats. Higher pork costs continue to pressure the domestic retail China business. Grocery product segment profit was flat for the quarter as earnings from value-added products did not offset increased advertising expenses and acquisition transaction costs related to the Justin's deal. Sales were up 3% aided by the inclusion of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from SKIPPY peanut butter, SPAM luncheon meat, and Wholly Guacamole. Our grocery products team continues to deliver exciting and innovative new products such as SKIPPY pb bites and the Herdez Guacamole salsa. Both recently introduced products are exceeding our expectations in the marketplace. Specialty foods segment profit decreased 13% and sales decreased 25%, primarily due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands and reductions in contract manufacturing sales. Our CytoSport team posted strong growth for Muscle Milk protein beverages and powders once again this quarter. We continue to be pleased with the new Muscle Milk protein smoothies, which have been well received by consumers. Now, as we look forward into the fourth quarter, we expect refrigerated foods to continue growing sales and earnings through increases in value-added products in both the retail and food service channels. Our early view on fiscal 2017 shows a roughly 2% to 3% increase in hog supply. With the majority of new industry capacity coming online starting in the summer of 2017, we expect to see favorable market conditions through most of fiscal 2017. Jennie-O Turkey Store is positioned to show strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter and continues to be focused on regaining distribution. Lower grain input costs should continue to be a tailwind in the fourth quarter. As we announced in the second quarter call, we are excited to be back on air in the second half of the year with our very successful make-the-switch campaign. We expect this advertising campaign to help improve distribution and growth of our Jennie-O ground Turkey product. We expect continued growth in our SPAM luncheon meat and SKIPPY peanut butter products to drive fourth quarter results for the international segment. Grocery products is expected to show strong sales growth driven by the inclusion of Justin's and positive momentum in SKIPPY peanut butter and Wholly Guacamole dips. The Muscle Milk brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories and we expect that to continue. We're also very excited about the innovation the CytoSport team will be delivering in the fourth quarter. The specialty foods segment will not show year-over-year sales and earnings growth due to the sale of the Diamond Crystal Brands business. And finally, we continue to focus our marketing and advertising efforts on brands such as Hormel Pepperoni, Applegate, Hormel Black label bacon, Hormel Natural Choice, SPAM and Jennie-O. These marketing and advertising efforts are supplemented by the great work being done by our direct sales forces in both retail and food service channels. And we are extremely proud to report that just this week Hormel Foods was ranked number one in the 50 best companies to sell-for ranking by Selling Power magazine. This is a huge honor for the company and is further confirmation of the strength of our brands and sales teams. So as a result of a strong third quarter performance, one-time gains from various discrete tax events and continued confidence in our business, we are raising our full year guidance from $1.56 to $1.60 per share to $1.60 to $1.64 per share. And our early look into fiscal 2017 shows us once again growing sales and earnings. We will have more precise guidance for you on our fourth quarter call. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jody Feragen to discuss the financial information relating to the third quarter. Jody Feragen : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 totaled $195.7 million, up 33% compared to $146.9 million last year. Diluted earnings per share were $0.36, also a 33% increase. Sales for the third quarter totaled $2.30 billion, compared to $2.19 billion for the same period last year, a 5% increase. Four of our five segments delivered revenue increases. Specialty foods sales declined due primarily to the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands. Volume for the third quarter was 1.22 billion pounds, up 1% from the same quarter last year. Tonnage was negatively impacted by the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. The Jennie-O Turkey Store results for the third quarter included a $9.6 million mark-to-market loss on hedges due to temporary ineffectiveness. Advertising expense for the quarter was $52.6 million, compared to $33.9 million last year, as we continued to invest in our brands across all five segments. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 28.6% versus 35.6% in fiscal 2015. The rate was favorably impacted by $14 million of one-time discrete tax items associated primarily with an international entity restructuring. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 32% and 32.5%, including the one-time discrete items from the third quarter. Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 529.7 million, compared to 528.5 million shares last year. The diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the third quarter was 542.2 million shares compared to 541.2 million last year. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock, spending $38.6 million in the third quarter. We have 14.3 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization in place. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $250 million, the same as last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $66 million, compared to $41.8 million last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32.6 million compared to $33.3 million last year. We paid our 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, 2016, at the annual rate of $0.58 per share. As a reminder, fiscal 2016 includes an extra week in the fourth quarter. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Savannah? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jody, congratulations. You'll be definitely missed. Jody Feragen : Thank you, Akshay. Akshay Jagdale : Yes. So, I wanted to ask about refrigerated foods and just the pork operating environment in general. For next year, I know it's hard to pin down what other people's plans are, but regarding your plan for total company growth in EPS next year, what does that assume for capacity utilization rates for the industry? Because that's an important factor next year, right? So that's my first question. Jody Feragen : So pork operating margins for this year were a bit higher than we had initially expected on our Q2 call, really supported by great supply of hogs, which provided favorable pricing on that environment, and then continued strong demand supporting the cut-out. As far as fiscal 2017, we just started our process. We would expect them to be somewhat similar to fiscal 2016 at this point in time. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And Jeff, on the commentary on the long-term guidance and the change, I mean, I know you've been extremely responsible and have managed the company exceptionally well, so I trust this is the right thing to do. But I'm just trying to make sure that apart from telling us things differently, the management -- you're not changing any incentives, et cetera. There's business as usual there, right? I mean, I think what you are trying to indicate is by providing more and more clarity before, you were trying to help people, but it's starting to maybe hurt the volatility maybe in the shares. But I just want to make sure nothing is changing from a management compensation and sort of how you day-to-day manage the business now, right? Like you've grown earnings consistently over time by improving the margin mix and making good acquisitions. Everything is essentially the same in that regard; you're just changing the way you're going to be communicating with the Street, correct? Jeff Ettinger : Appreciate the question, Akshay. Really, our company's focus is on meeting the five and 10 goals. We found that providing the individual segment operating margin ranges seem to sometimes distract from these goals. And honestly, we've not proven to be overly accurate in estimating the margins for each segment. Things come up, the Jennie-O AI issue, the DCB divestiture, et cetera, and you're dealing with variables of both sales and earnings for each business unit when you get into a margin like that. I'd point to our performance at Jennie-O Turkey Store this quarter is a good example of why we believe the segment margin percentages may be a less meaningful measure. On an operating percentage basis, you could look at Q3 and say oh, that was a bad quarter for Jennie-O Turkey Store because its operating margins fell, but this would obscure the fact that Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a $20 million improvement in segment profit for the quarter. Honestly, we're seeking to deliver sales and earnings dollars and not specific percentages. Jim Snee : And Akshay, this is Jim, if I could piggyback on Jeff's comments. I think we want to be clear that we are still providing segment specific guidance when it comes to their expected contribution to those overall five and 10 goals. I think what we've learned is that some of the discussion around segment margins can be very short-term focused versus our goal of focusing on some of the long-term measures such as these corporate growth goals. And so it will be business as usual, be holding the business units accountable the same way we have in the past. There are no incentive changes, so we will be managing the business in the same way we have. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And just one last one on sort of timing of -- this goal has meant -- the long-term goals are truly meant to be long-term and we understand that. But help me understand -- so you've been outperforming those pretty consistently almost every year, but more so in recent years because of some favorable conditions, if I may. So when might you be expected to potentially underperform those? And specifically referring to -- are you worried about this capacity coming on in the pork -- in pork processing that we hear about? Thank you. I'll pass it on. Jeff Ettinger : That's a great question, Akshay, and I think it's -- in any given year, top or bottom line numbers can significantly overperform and we've seen that over the last decade, right. We've had years where we've overperformed on one of those variables and underperformed on the other. But, we are focused on the long-term aspect of that. In terms of what's happening in the industry, we've talked frequently about our balanced model. And so, we do believe that for every action, there's a reaction and so as these additional capacity comes online, there's excess supply and things that will happen on the input cost side of the business. And so, we believe that our balanced model will allow us to weather any storm if you will. And I think that's supported by the fact that we've had 27 out of 30 years of earnings growth and this year obviously will be 28 out of 31. So that's our position. Akshay Jagdale : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam : Hi. Good morning. Congratulations, Jody. Jody Feragen : Thanks Farha. Farha Aslam : My questions focus more on the quarter. There was a lot of M&A acquisitions and divestitures in this current quarter. Would you be able to give us kind of volume or sales regarding the acquisition of Applegate and Justin's and the impact of the divestitures of Diamond Crystal Brands as well as kind of what the impact of the Justin's transaction costs were on the quarter? Jeff Ettinger : DCB we have provided on an annualized basis that was in the $250 million range and the quarters were relatively consistent. Jody can provide you a little color on the Justin's transaction cost. Jody Feragen : So we've had -- didn't consider them material to be a call-out specifically for the quarter, but they amounted to between transaction costs and step-up in inventory accounting, they amounted to about $3 million. Grocery products really a lot of their segment margin change was a significant increase in advertising for that segment. Farha Aslam : And then just on the Applegate and Justin's sales contributions or volume contributions in the quarter? Jody Feragen : I don't have those offhand, but we guided that Justin's in fiscal 2017 was going to be about $100 million. I'd say we only own -- had them for a part of the -- Applegate is basically we're lapping that now, coming in the fourth quarter, so I don't have those specifics with me. Farha Aslam : Okay. And then my follow-up is on the $9.6 million mark-to-market in Turkey. Would you be able to elaborate on what caused that? Do we get take back in subsequent quarters? Just more color on that mark-to-market impact. Jody Feragen : So we're probably one of the few companies that actually uses these special accounting treatment for hedge accounting, which allows you to put the mark-to-market gains or losses in any quarter on your balance sheet and then it's recognized as it flows through cost of goods when the Turkeys come to the plant basically or as the feed is consumed. What happens when you technically become ineffective, which is a regression analysis comparing futures prices to cash markets and because of some anomalies in the cash markets this quarter, you can have them go ineffective and you recognize all the gains and losses in your P&L. So we believe a one-time impact. It's recognizing some losses that would have been recognized through the future, but they're just hitting all in one period, which kind of skews Jennie-O's results. So Nathan's really well acquainted with hedge accounting so if you want a follow-up primer on that he'd be a great one to talk to. Farha Aslam : Just bottom line, we essentially get that back as you won't have that loss in future quarters. Jody Feragen : Absolutely, it's a timing. Farha Aslam : It's just timing. Thank you very much. That's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone and let me add to everyone's congratulation, Jody, on the retirement. Maybe my first question is on the top line and less so about the quarter specifically, but more about getting back on track with that 5% revenue growth target. Were it have been and relative to continue to be in a fairly deflationary protein price environment for at least the next 18 months, which to me would suggest that to get anywhere close to that 5% and maybe it's more like 3% to 4% organic, volumes are going to have to carry a bigger portion of that total mix. Can you talk about the volume trends that you're seeing in the business today because you look at in grocery and refrigerated specifically and there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of organic volume growth and maybe I'm interested in kind of your thoughts if you maybe leaned a little bit too hard into the value-added premiumization of some of these categories that's come at the expense of volumes. Thanks. Jeff Ettinger : I mean our ultimate goal is to sell a higher mix of branded value-added items which kind of absent the switches of market conditions should over time make our net sales be a stronger growth vehicle than volume inherently. There clearly are franchises within the company that are more responsive to markets or bacon pricing or pork pricing or [indiscernible] would be more along those lines. But, most of the grocery portfolio is less that way. Jennie-O Turkey Store has been able to hold their pricing on a stronger basis. We have a lot of franchises that we're really excited about that we think are at least 5% growing franchises, many of which did quite well this quarter and so we kind of talked in past calls that we were a little disappointed with our top line but had felt it was trending in the right direction and indeed Q3 showed an acceleration of that trend and we look at that favorably now heading into next year. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on the margin outlook commentary that you gave earlier. I appreciate with drawing the segment, specific segment margin guidance, but if you're going to get corporate margin expansion either your higher margin businesses are growing faster than the core are you getting aggregate margin expansion across the entirety of the portfolio. Can you talk about which pieces of that kind of split you're most excited about, maybe by business or within the portfolio specifically? Jim Snee : Sure. Adam, this is Jim. I think on the sales side of the business, we see positive momentum in brands such as Muscle Milk. Certainly Jennie-O and the work that they've done with the ground Turkey business there and getting back on air that make the switch. The addition of the Justin's business, the SKIPPY brand, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez coming out of our MegaMex joint venture. From a food service perspective we're really positive about the work that team's been doing. Our Bacon 1 Fully Cooked Bacon, Natural Choice out of refrigerated foods. So there's a lot of excitement and momentum that we believe will continue in 2017. Adam Samuelson : All right. Great. That's very helpful. I'll pass it along. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Mario Contreras of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mario Contreras : Good morning. Jeff Ettinger : Good morning. Nathan Annis : Hi, Mario. Mario Contreras : So I wanted to follow up on the comments around fiscal 2017 guidance. Can you just clarify -- I know maybe it's early, but the assumption of growth, is that off of a reported basis or would that be off of a 52nd week comp? And then on top of that, can you give any color around which specific segments would be more likely to contribute to growth? Thanks. Jim Snee : So Mario, this is Jim. And it would be on a reported basis as we look into 2017. And we recognize we've had many consecutive quarters of great results and obviously a key concern is whether we really can grow in 2017. So I talked in the last question about the sales side of the business and the positive momentum that we're seeing. Another thing that obviously we believe in and it served us well is our balanced business model. So we've got a favorable outlook on key inputs, such as pork, beef, grains. That really is going to combine with the sales momentum that will allow us to submit a plan to our Board of Directors that will show growth in earnings in 2017. And clearly we'll give you a more precise look and range in November on the call. Mario Contreras : Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just an additional question on Jenny-O. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the competitive environment there and then focusing on your market share. Are you feeling like you're getting placement on the shelves at an appropriate pace relative to your peers? Thanks. Jim Snee : As I commented, obviously the supply ramped up throughout the quarter and that's really the best position for the Jennie-O Turkey Store business to be in. And as we look across the business, there was strong food service performance, strong business in the deli area of the business. The retail distribution has continued to be a battle but the team is having success. The trays continue to do very well and we recognize that there is competition in the meat case but this is not unusual. There's been other times in the Jennie-O Turkey Store history where they faced this type of competition and we do believe that we're seeing the growth that we deserve. And we believe that the brand and the product lines continue to be on trend with consumers and over time we'll continue to get expanded distribution and share. Mario Contreras : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Rob Moskow : Hi. Thanks and congratulations again, Jody. Just some clarity on the fiscal 2016 guidance. The EPS bump of $0.04, my math is that $0.03 comes from the tax rate and maybe a $0.01 comes from operating profit being better than you expected for the year. Is that a fair assessment as to how you're looking at it, or is all of the bump from the tax rate and the tax outlook? And then I have a quick follow-up. Jody Feragen : No, I would look at the bump from Q3 tax impact as about $0.02 and then we have the negative hedging impact in Jennie-O that partially offsets it by another -- by my math, another $0.01. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be similar to what our ongoing rate has been. So getting to a full year effective tax rate with the lower one in the third quarter overall it's not going to be driven by taxes. Rob Moskow : Right. Okay. So your view is -- well, it still helps the year, though. Jody Feragen : Yes, it does. Rob Moskow : But operating profit, it's a guide up on operating profit as well. Jody Feragen : Absolutely. Rob Moskow : Okay, good. And then, the follow-up I had was on, I guess Jim's comments about it being a battle in the meat case. I think you said that you were trying to expand your East Coast distribution and capacity in Turkey. Is that what you're really referring to, Jim? And maybe a few more specifics as to how much you've expanded your abilities in the East Coast and what the outlook is? Jim Snee : Sure. I think our challenge has been clearly we're just ramping up supply. And so we have talked about the geographic expansion that we did have to put on hold last year and early this year. And so that's part of the solution, Rob. I think what we're talking about here is regaining even some of the existing distribution that perhaps we weren't able to supply last year. So it's really a combination of both those things. And there's no doubt that there is competition in the meat case, but I guess I would just reiterate that it's not unusual, we've been there before and for us the bigger issue, the bigger message is that this product line, Jennie-O ground Turkey, is on trend with consumers over the long-term. Rob Moskow : Is there any way to quantify like what your distribution percentage is today compared to history and help us -- it will help us model out why the growth will continue. Jim Snee : Sure. Nathan, you want to -- Jeff Ettinger : It also may depend, Rob, this is Jeff, on what products you're talking about. Clearly, we've talked about trade pack quite a bit. It has a certain share position. It has the unique element that it competes not only against other ground Turkey brands, but significantly against ground beef. But there's a lot of other pieces of both the retail and deli component of Jennie-O. They would each have their own set of numbers in that regard. Rob Moskow : Yes. That's what makes it hard for us to figure out where it's going. So if there's something that we can focus on to help make the case on distribution growth being a driver, tray pack may be -- is tray pack 30% of the story, 40% of the story? Can you help us in that regard? Jody Feragen : Why don't you take a follow-up with Nathan because I don't have that at our fingertips right here. Rob Moskow : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Good morning, everyone. Jody, congratulations and well deserved. Jody Feragen : Thank you. Ken Zaslow : My first question is just housekeeping. When you talk about growth in 2017, you said sales and EPS. I just want to make sure, you're also talking about operating profit growth and it's not just a tax or corporate expense benefit in 2017. Is that a fair assessment? Jeff Ettinger : Yes. Ken Zaslow : Okay. Then my second question really is when I look at the grocery products business, can you talk about how that -- for the current quarter, how that actually matched or -- it underperformed our expectations. I'm trying to figure out how you guys thought about that business in terms of operating profit and what you see is the outlook for that business, given the lower input cost and somewhat surprising kind of compression on the margin side. Jim Snee : Sure. Ken, this is Jim. Again, from a sales perspective or brand perspective, clearly very pleased with the work the team did on continuing to grow the SPAM franchise. The SKIPPY business, the introduction of SKIPPY pb bites continues to go well. Our Mexican foods portfolio also continues to perform well. As we mentioned, we did have some increased advertising cost but that's -- from our perspective, a positive to support the ongoing and future brand growth. And there's no doubt, we have a couple of areas in the units that are work in process. The chunk meats category, which it's not a huge part of the portfolio, but that's become competitive and our team is working on really taking a different approach with the product offerings that we have there. Again, we talked about Compleats being down and we're working very strategically to expand the availability of some of the value tier offerings and really increasing the sales or unit rates. And so for them it was a mixed bag, but I think we still feel very positive on the outlook for grocery products going forward. I think one other thing to consider for this quarter, it would be more of a product mix issue. Some of the canned items are not typically high sellers at this time of year. But overall, feel very positive about the transformation of the portfolio and where GP's headed. Jody Feragen : I would just add to Jim's comment that we saw quite a run-up in trim, which is an input on a lot of the grocery products items. So while they experienced favorable cost of goods in a lot of areas that was one area that did negatively impact them. Ken Zaslow : I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeremy Scott of CLSA. Please go ahead. Jeremy Scott : Hi. Good morning and congrats, Jody, on the retirement. Jody Feragen : Thanks. Jeremy Scott : A couple questions on Applegate. Can you talk about the volume performance for this brand since you've taken over. Have some great penetration in some of the upper scale retail channels that are still growing. Just wondering what the outlook for Applegate here on the volume side and what it's been in the past year. Jim Snee : Jeremy, good morning. This is Jim. I think just as a reminder, when we took over the Applegate business, clearly we knew that there were some raw material or supply issues in terms of supporting that business. And then, those were compounded with the outbreak of Avian influenza. So in the short-term, the team has worked really hard to get raw material supply back in place and we feel good about where we are today. So that certainly made the volume growth a battle for the team and so we had to regain some lost distribution. But the growth, we've seen some growth, we've seen some increased distribution. From our perspective, we love the brand, we love what the future holds for the brand and again, on a short-term basis it's clearly on target to deliver what we said it would deliver at the time of acquisition. Jeremy Scott : Okay. Just on the follow-up to a previous question, how do you view -- when you start to lap Applegate in the fourth quarter, where do you see volumes trending? As we look now at a more organic basis for refrigerated foods. Jeff Ettinger : He is saying all of refrigerated foods. Jeremy Scott : For all of refrigerated foods. Jim Snee : I mean I think, again, as we think about the different parts of the refrigerated foods portfolios, our meat products team continues to be focused on the value-added items and they're doing a nice job. Our food service business continues to outperform the industry and we expect that to continue. The Applegate business will continue to show growth that we've got returns of supply. So overall we feel good about that portfolio as well. Jody Feragen : I would just add that as we transition particularly when you look at Applegate that is a more of a sales driven business than a volume driven, and as we continue to value-add the portfolio, volumes become a little less meaningful as you compare to prior quarters or years that may have had more of a commodity element. Jeremy Scott : Got it. Can you touch on some of the competitive activity you're seeing at retail and do you plan to ramp up promotional activity as a response in the coming quarters? Jeff Ettinger : Are you talking about any particular part of the grocery store or our business or -- ? Jeremy Scott : I would say in some of the higher traffic channels like sausage and frozen breakfast. Jeff Ettinger : Yes. I think, Jeremy, our position on that is clearly we're focused on the effectiveness and our ability to not only deliver a return for us, but for the retail partner. And so we continue to look at categories individually and where there's opportunity to be effective with additional spending. We certainly will take advantage of that. But can't tell you today that there's a significant specific plan in any one given category. Jeremy Scott : Got it. And then, last question. In the past you've been able to repurchase shares as the M&A pipeline thinned out a bit. What is your opportunity to scale up buybacks over the coming years and can you walk us through your thought process there and some of the hurdles. Jody Feragen : So, really we kind of look at our share repurchase as being an opportunity to offset stock option exercises. We still believe that using that as a compensation element is appropriate to drive our business. So we're constrained because of the ownership of the Hormel foundation at about 48% to 49% these days. So we've agreed that they should be under 50%. So that would be the biggest constraint. Obviously, took advantage of some pressure on our stock this past quarter to be in the market and acquire some of those shares. Jeremy Scott : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. At this time we have no further questions. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Annis for any additional or closing remarks. Jeff Ettinger : Thanks, Savannah. This is Jeff Ettinger. I'll go ahead and conclude the call for us. So, as some of you may have heard we actually celebrated our company's 125th anniversary recently here in July. This provided us an unique opportunity to bring many of our company's employees together to celebrate the occasion. After visiting with these employees from across the company I've never been more optimistic about our company's future and our ability to deliver growth. I'm very proud of our team's performance this quarter and I look forward to continued excellent results going forward. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Nathan Annis : Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the fourth quarter of FY '16. We released our results this morning before the market opened, around 6 :30 a.m. Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.HormelFoods.com under the Investor section.  On our call today is Jim Snee, President and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Sheehan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results for the quarter and further assumptions relating to our FY '17 outlook. The line will be opened for questions following Jim Sheehan's remarks.  As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to get back in the queue. An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11 :30 a.m. Central Standard Time today, November 22, 2016. The dial-in number is 877-627-6590 and the access code is 5999118. It will also be posted to our website and archived for one year.  Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor Statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the Company, are fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Please refer to pages 33 through 40 in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 24, 2016 for more details. It can be accessed on the website. Additionally, please note the Company used non-GAAP results for FY '15 to provide investors with a better understanding of the Company's operating performance by excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items affecting comparability. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. During our call today, comparisons to the fourth quarter and full year of FY '15 will be made to these non-GAAP results. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. James Snee : Well, thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record fourth quarter results of $0.45 per share, up 22% from last year. Sales for the quarter were up 9%, on a 9% increase in volume. For the full year, earnings per share were $1.64, up 24% versus FY '15. Sales were $9.5 billion, up 3% and volume was up 2%. For the quarter, three of our five segments reported volume sales and earnings growth demonstrating the strength of our balanced business model. Refrigerated foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store posted excellent earnings, both up double-digits. Grocery products recorded solid gains, while specialty and international earnings were down for the quarter. I am particularly pleased with our top line results, with four of our segments generating sales growth.  Refrigerated foods fourth quarter operating profit increased 51%, with sales up 8% and volume up 9%. Refrigerated foods benefited from excellent growth in both retail and foodservice channels and from lower input costs notably hogs and bellies. In foodservice, items like Hormel Bacon1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth, while our retail business was led by items such as Applegate deli meats, Hormel Natural Choice and Hormel Gathering party trays.  Jennie-O Turkey Store fourth quarter segment profit increased 26% with sales increasing 29%. Volume was up 32%. As a reminder, last year's results were negatively impacted by avian influenza. Higher bird weights and low grain prices were a benefit for the quarter. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store foodservice business performed well, with growth coming from many areas such as our Jennie-O raw boneless breast and sliced breast meat categories.  We also experienced sales growth in our retail and deli businesses. We were back on air with the Jennie-O Make the Switch campaign through October and have seen a positive response once again from our consumers. We saw strong sales growth in grocery products, up 16% and segment profit was up 5%. Our legacy portfolio performed nicely with organic sales up 10%, including gains from many brands such as SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, Hormel Compleats, Herdez salsa. In addition, Justin's specialty nut butters contributed approximately $25 million in sales to the quarter and is well on track to meet our valuation pro forma and the $100 million in FY '17 sales we guided to when we announced the acquisition.  International sales increased 2%, while operating profits decreased 16%. While we're encouraged by the results from our SKIPPY business in China, our meat business continues to be pressured by high input costs.  Exports of fresh pork improved, as U.S. exports became more competitive due to lower hog prices. Specialty foods, excluding Diamond Crystal brands, grew sales 6% and volumes 11%. CytoSport posted excellent sales growth as they continued to introduce new innovative items in both ready-to-drink and powder formats. The CytoSport team also launched new Muscle Milk bars featuring 12 different flavors. Acceptance by our retail partners has been favorable. The decline in segment profit is attributed to increased advertising on a year-over-year basis for the Muscle Milk brand. Innovation has been a foundation of our Company's success over the last 125 years which is why we recently announced a new innovation challenge for the year 2020, to have 15% of our total sales come from new products introduced in the previous five years. We finished 2016 with approximately 12% of sales from new products launched in the fiscal years' 2011 to 2015. This is a stretch goal for our organization and we expect to make substantial progress next year aided by recently introduced products, as well as those in the pipeline.  Looking to FY '17, we have positive momentum in each segment, employees all working towards the same goals and numerous initiatives in each of our strategic growth pillars of global, multi-cultural, healthy and holistic and on-the-go. Grocery products is expected to show growth in excess of their long term growth goals of 3% top line and 6% bottom line. Growth is expected to come from the positive momentum we have in SKIPPY peanut butter products, Herdez salsas and Wholly Guacamole dips in addition to Justin's. We will continue to invest in our key brands in 2017.  Yesterday, we announced the divestiture of the Farmer John, Saag's and PFFJ farms businesses. While the businesses performed well, they no longer met our strategic goals. Additionally, the divestiture allows for the integration of the pork processing facility at Farmer John, with the majority of live production operations which supply the facility and are currently owned by Smithfield. This divestiture is in the best interest of our shareholders and we continue to seek opportunities to utilize our cash towards investments aligned to our growth goals.  We're expecting decreased sales in refrigerated foods, as increased sales of value-added products will be offset by the divestiture of Farmer John which represents approximately $500 million. We see continued growth coming from brands such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel pepperoni and Applegate, in addition to foodservice sales growth from Hormel Bacon1 fully cooked bacon, Hormel Fire Braised meats and Hormel pizza toppings.  Due to the earnings per share dilution of approximately $0.03, refrigerated foods earnings are expected to be flat. Jim Sheehan will provide more color on the hog and pork environment in FY '17. We expect strong sales and earnings growth for the full year, as the Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with retail, deli and foodservice customers and consumers. Results will be weighted to the back half of the year, as the first half faces more difficult comparisons.  We intend to continue our advertising investments through the Make the Switch campaign to highlight the versatility of turkey in many of our consumer's favorite recipes. We expect our international segment to deliver strong profitable growth. In addition to improving results in China, we anticipate stronger exports for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter and CytoSport protein products. Our international team is eager to get our Jiaxing plant up and running in first half of the year, so they can leverage new production capabilities to grow our retail and foodservice businesses.  Specialty Foods results will likely show year-over-year declines in the first half due to the divestiture of Diamond Crystal brands, but we expect organic sales and earnings increases in the back half, as we anniversary the divestiture. The Muscle Milk brand has been performing well in both the protein beverage and powder categories and we expect those results to continue. I'm also very excited about our new Muscle Milk smoothies and many new Muscle Milk items in the innovation pipeline. As we roll up our earnings outlook, we would have expected our guidance range to be $1.71 to $1.77 per share, representing a 4% to 8% increase. We took into consideration the three prior years of double-digit earnings growth and the one less week in 2017 as compared to 2016. However, factoring in the divestiture of Farmer John business representing earnings per share of approximately $0.03, we're setting our guidance range to $1.68 to $1.74 per share.  From a sales perspective, excluding the impact of both the Diamond Crystal brands and Farmer John divestitures and the positive impact of the Justin's acquisition, we anticipate our business will generate organic sales in line with our long term target of 5%. We believe our Company can continue to grow at 5% top line and 10% bottom line over the long term. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the fourth quarter and additional key drivers for 2017. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Volume in the fourth quarter was 1.4 billion pounds, a 9% increase compared to last year. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, a 9% increase also. Excluding the impact of both the sale of Diamond Crystal brands and the Justin's acquisition, volume was up 14% and sales were up 11%. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $244 million, up 30% compared to GAAP net earnings last year of $187 million. Net earnings were up 22%, compared to non-GAAP earnings of $200 million last year.  FY '16 was a 53 week year, with the extra week falling in Q4. We estimate the impact from this extra week was between 1% to1.5% for the full year. Advertising expense for the quarter was $55 million, compared to $30 million last year as we continued to invest in our brands. Looking into 2017, we anticipate advertising expenses to be similar to 2016.  Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $35.4 million, compared to $34.4 million last year. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $11 million, up 41% compared to last year. The increase was a result of our strong results in mega packs with brands such as Herdez salsa and Wholly Guacamole performing well in the marketplace. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 33% versus 35.2% in 2015. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%.  Cash flow from operations was $371 million in the fourth quarter, up 23% over last year. During the quarter, $145 million of short term debt was repaid. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $90 million, compared to $47 million last year. The increase in CapEx is primarily related to our new plant in Jiaxing, China and lean ground turkey expansion at Jennie-O Turkey Store.  For FY '17, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $250 million, compared to $256 million in 2016. Major projects for 2017 include the completion of our plant in China and numerous capacity expansions for value-added product lines. We will continue to invest capital to support our value-added products and improve food and employee safety.  We paid our 353rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15, at an annual rate of $0.58 per share. Our Board of Directors approved an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, representing a 17% increase. FY '17 will represent the 51st consecutive year of increasing our dividends. Jim Snee and I intend to continue this longstanding policy.  We repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock, spending $43 million in the fourth quarter. We have 13 million shares remaining to be purchased from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises.  As we discussed at our third quarter conference call, we're providing a total Company margin goal. Our goal for 2020 is to have our EBIT margin to be in the top quartile of our peer group. Today, the top quartile range is 15% to19%. The goal is consistent with our long term growth goals of 5% top line and 10% bottom line. We experienced favorable input costs for the fourth quarter in many, but not all of our businesses. Key inputs such as hog and belly prices were down, compared to the fourth quarter last year. Trim prices were below -- were flat, beef prices were down. Corn and soybean meal prices were lower for the quarter versus 2015. Turkey breast meat prices were below 2015 during avian influenza. We expect favorable hog and pork markets for 2017. The USDA is calling for a 3% to 4% increase in the hog supply in 2017. The majority of the new industry capacity is anticipated to come on line after the summer of 2017. We expect hog harvest levels at our Austin and Fremont plants to be down 1% due to one less week in the fiscal year.  Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for Jennie-O Turkey Store in 2017. We anticipate turkey breast meat prices to be below 2016 levels. Going forward, we expect lower beef and chicken input costs for our value-added products. We also see comparable prices to 2016 for other key raw materials such as peanuts and tomatoes.  One area we're watching closely is the avocado market. The avocado market increased substantially in 2016. We're maintaining an adequate supply of avocados by leveraging our global supply chain. Overall, we're confident that the strength of our value-added products, recent acquisitions and favorable market conditions will provide Hormel another record year. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I thought that Jim and Jim you were going to give us at some point a three to five year outlook for operating margins and where you think margins can go kind of longer term. Are you working on that or am I mistaken? Jim Sheehan : We did provide a margin goal that is to be in the top quartile of our peer group by 2020. Currently, that margin range is 15% to 19%. We're currently in the third quartile of that group so to reach that goal we not only need to improve our own margins but we need to outperform our peers. Robert Moskow : Okay got you, so top quartile 15% to 19%, that\u2019s over three to five years or is that correct? Jim Sheehan : 15% to 19% is where those margins exist now. We intend to be in the top quartile in 2020. Robert Moskow : Okay, sounds good. And I guess my follow-up here would be specifically on your refrigerated outlook, obviously refrigerated to be flat in fiscal 17 despite losing some profit from the divestiture is quite bullish for the business. Can you give us a sense about the mix of that, do you expect your fresh pork profits to be up or do you expect those to be down and value-added mix do you expect those profits to be up or down, can you give us a sense of what the break out is? James Snee : Sure. Well good morning, Rob this is Jim Snee. I think as we think about our refrigerated Foods portfolio we've got a lot of positive momentum. Our foodservice organization had a great year in 2016. We expect that to continue in 2017. Our meat products group with a number of their value-added items, bacon, party trays, Natural Choice, all performed extremely well this year so we expect that to continue and clearly those will all have a positive impact as we head into 2017. Robert Moskow : Okay, so with profits being flat is the implication that value-added is up and maybe commodity is down a little bit? James Snee : Yes, that's correct. Operator : We will now hear from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam : Could you talk about the new pork plants that are coming online how you anticipate that will affect your business and in particular how that would affect your pork operations? Jim Sheehan : We're expecting hog prices to be similar to 2016 and 2017. We believe there's a balanced supply and demand of hogs in 2017, the USDA is estimating that the hogs will be up about 3% to 4%. The plants that are coming online are expected to come on line after the summer of 2017. Farha Aslam : And so beyond 2017, how do you think Hormel is positioning itself for those new plants coming online? Jim Sheehan : We think that we're well positioned. We're constantly looking at the supply needs that we have for our value-added products. The reason that we harvest hogs is to provide those raw materials for the value-added products so we're really balancing it with the value-added products that we need. Farha Aslam : Okay so you can just purchase more of the meat coming out of those facilities? Jim Sheehan : That's exactly correct. Farha Aslam : Rather than the hogs, so you continue to maintain that balance in your portfolio? Jim Sheehan : That's correct. Farha Aslam : Okay and then my last question is on M&A. You have a pristine balance sheet. What are you seeing out there? What are you interested in right now? James Snee : Our pipeline on the M&A side is full and just as a reminder, we're looking for opportunities that are accretive to our overall portfolio, are number one and number two in the categories in which they compete. We want to make sure that we can bring value to the business, so I mean we start there but we made sure that they are aligned around our strategic growth areas of becoming more global, more multi-cultural items or brands that are more on the go and then of course this area of healthy and holistic. It's all about timing and getting some of them across the finish line but I would tell you that the pipeline is robust and full. Operator : Our next participant is Jeremy Scott with CLSA. Jeremy Scott : So pretty impressive guidance number next year. I just wanted to clarify from your commentary it seems like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like Grocery Products is driving the majority of the organic top line and bottom line and I'm just - based on some of the trends we've seen in our checks it seems like a little bit of a stretch so if you can just maybe synthesize and break down exactly where most of the earnings growth will come from next year? James Snee : Sure, well good morning Jeremy. We feel good about all five of our business units, Grocery Products is planning to have a strong year next year organically in line with our 3% top line 6% bottom line goals, but then the addition of Justin's so we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Grocery Products coming off a very strong fourth quarter. Our Specialty Foods group with the work we've done building the Muscle Milk brand is showing impressive growth, as I mentioned earlier we do see strong value-added growth across a number of Refrigerated Foods portfolios and then we're well positioned we're back in supply with Jennie-O Turkey Store and so really believe that all five business units are going to be able to show very positive contributions as we head into 2017. Jeremy Scott : Okay, and then just maybe on the long term the top quartile of the 15%-19%, can you get there on the core business or is that include some type of mix of acquisitions and divestitures including obviously the Farmer John which is margin accretive but sales dilutive. Jim Sheehan : Yes, it's going to be a mix of all of those things, Jeremy. We know that we need improvements in our organic business. We will have M&A along the way and we're constantly reviewing our portfolio and if we have pieces of it that don't fit that are no longer strategic I think we've clearly established that we'll make the right moves there as well. Operator : We will now hear from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Just two questions. First on the long term target obviously, very much in line with what you've done historically but if you look at the last four years your margins are up I think 460 Bps, a vast majority 70% of that has been driven by Refrigerated Foods margins improving. Part of that I would say I don't know how much of it is related to industry dynamics being favorable so I'm just trying to understand like the building blocks of the next four years considering or coming off we'll be coming off of a pretty favorable environment in one of your segments that happens to have driven a vast majority of the increase historically so that's my first question. And the second one, again related to Refrigerated Foods when this capacity does come on which clearly you're saying in \u201817 doesn't look like it's going to cause any disruption, when it does come on, there's likely to be some disruption on the processing margins. How do you envision navigating through that environment from an earnings growth perspective? Thank you. James Snee : So on your first question, I mean for us we need to continue to grow our value-added businesses in all of our portfolios so we've been transparent that market conditions have provided some of the improvement in Refrigerated Foods but certainly not all of it. We've had a number of value-added improvements, some M&A activity in that space that's proved to be accretive and so those are the things that will continue to do across all of our businesses to move into that top quartile.  Your second question in regards to some of the capacity coming online post 2017, we have navigated through volatility and delivered earnings growth, 28 out of 31 years now and so as Markets change, clearly we know that we have to react and I think we've demonstrated that we can react that our business can react and deliver growth so we're watching all of it very closely. Jim\u2019s assessment of the timing we believe it's the most accurate timing that we have and we'll take advantage of it while we can and then when market conditions change we'll act accordingly. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Was hoping to dig deeper on the sales growth guidance of 5% organic for the year and think about it by business a little bit because I see a market outlook and you talked about during your cost that is at best neutral but probably a little bit deflationary given the key proteins that you touch and that kind of organic growth maybe save easy comps in Jennie-O in the first half of the year that for the totality of the portfolio hasn't done 5% organic for some time and I'm trying to just think about where the accelerations coming from in the base to get that kind of organic revenue growth especially given the commodity environment we're likely to continue to see for some time. James Snee : You know, as we've talked about all of our growth goals for each of the business units, we've had Grocery Products which is at throw and six organic and we do feel like we're well positioned with the success that we've had with Spam and Skippy and our air Des line of products to be able to deliver on their organic goal, as you mentioned the Jennie-O Turkey Store piece which we do believe we'll be able to exceed that 5% top line number, the specialty group we're going to have to anniversary the DCV piece but feel really good about the Muscle Milk business which is the driver of that organization. We see a return to our accelerated growth rates from our international business which is 10 top line 15 bottom line and so obviously Refrigerated Foods with the divestiture you're going to have a lot of moving parts there but as we go around the horn and think about all of our business units, we see a lot of momentum and feel really positive as we head into 2017 and we understand the deflationary piece you're talking about and there are some commodity portions of the portfolio that will react to that but so much of our portfolio is value-added that it's less impacted. Adam Samuelson : Okay and then maybe just a clarification point on the long term on that long term margin piece. A, 15%-19% would be where the top quartile is now so we're talking apples-to-apples the number for fiscal 16 is just the equity income minority interest what was the realized 2016 number and second is that long term margin goal going to be part of long term Management incentive compensation in any form? James Snee : The five and 10 will continue to be the goals we set and we measure against but as you take the five and 10 we will increase our operational margins and I want to be clear that we're talking about not 15 and 19 in 2020. We're just giving you the range that we see the top quartile currently. Adam Samuelson : Right, I'm just asking where you are today. Jim Sheehan : About 14%. Adam Samuelson : Okay and then so but it won't be part of formerly part of long term Management compensation as such? James Snee : We'll continue to be focused on 5% top line 10% bottom line. We have as I mentioned a little while ago some business units that are three and six in GP and then 10 and 15 in international but those are the long term growth goals that will continue to be focused on and incenting our top management. Operator : We will now hear from are Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I also wanted to touch on the operating margin so again another strong year of operating margin expansion. Is there a way to isolate the impact from the changes in the portfolio from divestitures and the recent acquisitions that you made, what type of benefit that helped in 2016 and how we should think about the mix impact next year? James Snee : The acquisitions have been accretive to our margins and we see those acquisitions continuing to perform strongly in 2017. So they've been an advantage. Rupesh Parikh : And the divestitures would be the same. Those obviously are lower than the margins weave historically had. James Snee : Correct. Rupesh Parikh : Is there any way to quantify what that benefit could be for the upcoming year? James Snee : No. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. And on the grocery products portfolio very strong products in your legacy with 109% organic growth. Want to get a sense of what's driving that this quarter and how you think about the sustainability and strength there? James Snee : Yes, our team has done a great job. When you think about the portfolio, we have had ongoing success as a result of the Skippy acquisitions, the investments we've made in that brand, the distribution we've gained, the innovation we've had and if you go across that entire line, Spam had great performance as well. That's a brand that we continue to invest in. We think about our multicultural product offerings, our salsas and dips and again something that's resonating with consumers that's on trend and we did have a nice fourth quarter from completes as well so obviously as we head into the future some of the comps are probably a little easier but I do think that our team is continuing to figure that brand out that product line so we just feel good about the momentum we have in Grocery Products. Rupesh Parikh : Okay great last one for me clearly your results have been an outlier compared to other food companies as you look at the grocery back drop on the foodservice side, have you seen any changes in the overall back drop on the macro front? James Snee : From a foodservice perspective, our team has consistently outperformed what's happening in the industry and they're doing that through their ability to connect with foodservice Operators by the salesforce, the direct sales for that we utilize, their ongoing innovation and really creating great solutions for operate res, so we expect that to continue. From a retail perspective it's the same thing. We understand what's happening with the consumer but the consumer is shopping many different parts of the store and I think the beauty of our portfolio is that no matter where they go in the store if center store or on the perimeter we've got a full offering of products to meet their needs and I think that really set us up for strong future growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Mario Contreras : So about a year ago we were hearing about relatively high pork operating margins moderated somewhat over the next couple of quarters but fast forwarding to today, it looks like that's once again at pretty historically high levels in terms of where the cut outs are versus live hog prices so I just wanted to get a sense of how you view that dynamic, what's driving the widening spread and where do you see that going over the next couple quarters here? Jim Sheehan : Well we focus primarily, Mario on hog prices and we see hog prices being similar to 2017 as they were in 2016 and 2017. The USDA is looking for an expansion of 3-4% and appears the supply and demand is in balance so we look at the hog Markets as being favorable as we go into 2017. It's important to understand that we're a net buyer of other commodities so we're impacted by some of the decreases in the other inputs, such as bellies and trim. Mario Contreras : Okay and then just one question on China. Want to understand where you see that recovery coming from in 2017. I know you have the plan that's going to be opening up at some point during the year so is that going to be driving most of the improvement or is there some other factors at play there, thanks. James Snee : This year the story in China was really the higher input costs and as we head into 2017, when we get past the Chinese New Year, we're forecasting a decline in that raw material market and so it wasn't a story of volume in China. The retail business got off to a slow start but it rebounded, our foodservice meat business was strong throughout the year, it really was more about the input cost and the tightening of the margins. We expect to get some relief after the Chinese New Year so we would expect to continue the volume growth and then have margin expansion as well. Operator : We will now hear from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Just wanted to touch base on this. Your margin outlook, getting into that 15%-19% CAGR by 2020, what is the progression step to get there? James Snee : I think it's the continued growth of the value-added product. The moving of the value-added product up what we've referred to is the value ladder taking into higher levels of margins. Clearly acquisitions are a part of our strategy. We've sold out some businesses that were on the lower end of that range so I think it's the focus on improving our operating margins across-the-board. Ken Zaslow : What about also operating favorable operating leverage because as you talk about sales growth this year you're in a deflationary environment your volumes will have to clearly exceed your pricing. My pricing could be down or flattish or whatever but it's all volume and yet you aren't talking about leveraging your facilities or any sort of structure all reassessment of your plant. Is there any other enhancement from a structural basis that we could think about? James Snee : Certainly. We're constantly looking at leveraging our capacity and finding the correct capacity utilizing the capacity in the optimal manner, continuous improvement as a focus of all of our plants taking cost out of the system as a focus of our operations every day so we're constantly focused on taking cost out whether it's through cost reductions or efficiencies in the operations. we made movements with a few plants now where we optimize other capacity and have been able to eliminate some excess capacity to improve the efficiencies. Ken Zaslow : Okay, I think it's a great target and over time hopefully what we may be able to get a little bit more insight on is the progression really the strategic improvement of how to get there because again, I think somebody earlier mentioned it that you have defied logic and not a commodity coming in the top quartile of the growth of your package food peers and you continue to do that so I'm just trying to figure out exactly what's the next steps to be able to get to that 15%-19% and I guess the value-added and just trying to figure out how you'll go from being top quartile in your growth rate to continue that process so any clarity on that is always helpful Thank you. James Snee : Well thanks, Ken. This is Jim. I think you hit on it right. There's been a very logical strategic progression and we do expect to continue down that path. It will be supplemented along the way certainly with right M&A opportunities but fundamentally and I've talked about it many times in the past, is for us it really is all about this formula for success so it's investing in the right brands, it's making sure that we have the right innovation process, I mean we're challenging ourself with this increased innovation goal and then the strategic acquisitions aligned around our growth pillars and so it is a very logical progression. It's also a very disciplined progression and I think what Jim Sheehan described to you in terms of our focus on continuous improvement each and every day going our people are going to work saying how do I do things a little more efficiently, a little more effectively to take costs out of the system those allied up to that logical progression in getting us to that top quartile so appreciate your comments but I mean that's how we're going to get there. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Eric Larson : First question I just want to clarify make sure that I'm collecting this with the divestiture of Farmer John, that effectively takes you out of all harvesting activities, do you have anything else anywhere else? James Snee : No, we still have our harvest facilities here in Austin, Minnesota and Freemont, Nebraska on the pork side of the business. Eric Larson : Yes, but you don't effectively own those? Via what from the labor settlement that you had I believe somebody else actually operates that for you is that correct? James Snee : In Freemont, I mean we own and operate in the Austin facility we have a third party relationship but that's in essence a pass through so we do have in our opinion we have two harvest operations, one in Austin and one in Freemont. Eric Larson : And then it was an impressive dividend increase. I was actually thinking that you were going to have even a greater dividend increase given the year that you had and I think that it puts you in a payout ratio of about 41% and I think your peer group is a little bit higher. Can you kind of clarify your kind of how you're targeting your payout ratio and maybe you're going to return more cash to shareholders through maybe modestly more aggressive buybacks more than maybe just covering your dilution from stock options can you kind of discuss that dynamic? Jim Sheehan : I'll do the math of our peer group we're number 11 out of 18 as we look at the peer group and we do have a goal to move that up over the years. We've done it in a fairly consistent but aggressive manner. We're focused on the use of cash. Dividends is one of the four uses of cash that we have. We certainly have been focused on acquisitions. We've made acquisitions over the last several years. We'll reinvest $250 million into CapEx in 2017 those are primarily to support our value-added businesses and we along with the dividend we also do some stock buyback. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll hear from Jeremy Scott with CLSA. Jeremy Scott : Just you probably heard this question a number of times but given the significant move in wholesale ground beef costs, does Jennie-O need a higher level of add and Marketing support going forward in order to sustain volume growth? Jim Sheehan : This is Jim Sheehan. I'll take that question. It continues to increase penetration of ground Turkey and the ground Turkey represents about 10-12% of the total ground meat Markets, we're competing well against the ground beef and we continue to see growth in that. We've expanded capacity for our ground Turkey business. James Snee : We need to watch that. Clearly we understand what's happening in that competitive set but again, our main focus is making sure we have the right products consumers are looking for and we've been through this before with ground beef pricing and so to use a comment from an earlier question is there's a logical progression here so this lien ground Turkey is connecting with consumers, Jim describes how it's growing in terms of its relative share to the grant meat market so we feel like we're well positioned. Will we be opportunistic where we need to be? Absolutely but the fact is we're in the right place, this is an on trend consumer product that we know is going to continue to grow. Jeremy Scott : I was hoping you could give a broader assessment of grocery trends relative to foodservice obviously we're seeing a growing gap between the relative inflation rates and perhaps the shift in demand. You know the strong sales in Spam and Skippy are you starting to see pantry restocking and which categories will continue to benefit in this environment? James Snee : I mean, I guess again, just going back to how we think about our business heading into 2017, we feel really good about the momentum we have in our Grocery Products division. Again Skippy has had a nice long runoff quarter-over quarter growth. Spam will show growth again in 2017 and then you referenced our foodservice business and again, great year 2016, poised for another great year in 2017, we talked a lot about our bacon one fully cooked bacon and the capital investments that we've made their support that business, so we feel really good about both grocery products and foodservice. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take a follow-up from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Just want to make sure I understand the guidance on Jennie-O correctly. I think you said that it's a difficult it will be more of a back half loaded year. Did you mean that in terms of sales and profit or just sales? And if I recall, I think January is when you think that you're going to get more distribution on shelves for your ground Turkey business because that's when retailers are resetting their merchandising? Thanks. James Snee : From a sales growth perspective, we see that being fairly consistent throughout the year, the earnings comp would be skewed to the back half and certainly, gaining distribution is tied to the plans that the retailers have so we'll continue to take advantage of that. I think again the underlying premise here is that our team is doing a great job, they are gaining distribution and it's a product line of lien ground Turkey that is squarely in the consumer need set and we feel really good about it. Robert Moskow : So you're on track in terms of your distribution expectations? James Snee : Yes absolutely. Operator : Once again we will hear from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Again just as we think about the long term goal, can you I know you probably aren't willing to give out a number on percentage value-added etc. , because I don't think that's how you manage the business but can you give us some color on sort of segment by segment how you're going to get to this margin target. I mean basically it equates to your normal algorithm of double digit EPS growth, so we know the formula is to increase percentage of value-added right? But probably what's more important math [indiscernible] is the margin profile of value-added you always are enhancing that, so can you without getting into the numbers can you just give us some sense of how you're managing how its managed at the segment level that would be helpful and I had one more follow-up. James Snee : Sure, this is Jim. I mean, I think the important thing when you're thinking about this is we have to absolutely remain focused on the long term growth algorithms that we've set for each of our business units so we talked about Grocery Products at throw and six and that's going to be a mix of organic growth and acquisitions. We're going to see the same thing across all of our business units, the other Refrigerated Foods, Jenny-O Turkey Store Specialty Foods, five and 10 and then we'll need international to return to their 10 and 15 long term growth algorithm. If we're able to deliver that and we know we will and we'll do it through abalones of organic growth, you referenced of value-added which is something we do each and every day and then also having the right strategic acquisitions that's the logical progression for how we get there. Akshay Jagdale : Okay and just one more so when you look back the list four years obviously you'd agree there been a benefit from grain costs and I guess favorable hog prices if I may. It's hard to quantify that bouging rally speaking, I think you also would agree that potentially, that's going reverse going forward. So when you think about you can call to offset that clearly M&A is an area where you can get more aggressive given your balance sheet and your solid track record but can you just give us any incremental sort of buckets that maybe historically weren't part of the equation that you might be considering? James Snee : I think our story of the markets ebb and flow and our history of delivering 28 out of 31 years of growth in some of the most volatile market conditions, there's a bucket to consider in terms of our ability to be able to weather unfavorable market conditions. Clearly you've hit it on the head that there are M&A opportunities for us as we head into the future. We've got as I mentioned earlier a robust pipeline of opportunities that we're pursuing and then I think the other thing we have to remember is you delivered the growth 28 out of 31 years but we also have a Management team that has 26 years of experience with Hormel Foods who are responsible for delivering those results, so as we head into the future, we're confident that we have the right people, the right products, the right processes in place to be able to get into that top quartile. Operator : With no further questions in the queue I would like to turn the call back over to your hosts for any additional or closing remarks. James Snee : Yes, well thank you all very much for your participation today. Before we leave today, I would like to take this time to acknowledge our outgoing CEO, Jeff Ettinger. As we previously announced, Jeff retired as CEO effective on October 30. During Jeff's tenure over the past 10 years, the Company significantly increased revenues, net earnings, dividends and shareholder value. Under Jeff's leadership, the Company continued to focus on innovation while adding new brands & Companies into the Hormel Foods family. Brands like Skippy, holy Guacamole, Applegate and Justins. I personally look forward to working with Jeff and his role as non-executive Chairman of the Board. I also want to let everyone know we will be holding our in vast or day in New York on June 15. I'm excited to showcase our senior leadership team and take you deeper into each of our segments while also describing our plans for growing the business. You will see a Press Release soon. Finally, I just want to conclude this call by saying I am extremely proud of the excellent results our team posted this quarter and for the full year. 14 straight quarters of record results is truly an accomplishment. One of our seven cultural beliefs here at Hormel Foods is results matter. And I know our team is up to the challenge of delivering another record year in 2017. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, I thank you for your participation and I want to wish you all a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Thank you for joining us today.

Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted sales and volume. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced record first quarter results of $0.44 per share, up 2% from last year. Sales for the quarter were down 1% on a 2% decrease in volume. Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 5%. For the quarter, three of our five segments reported earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products grew earnings, while Specialty Products earnings were flat. Jennie-O Turkey Store had a difficult quarter versus last year with earnings down 25%. Sales were up 13% and volume was up 22% compared to last year. Segment profit margins declined from over 24% in the first quarter last year to 16% this year. As a reminder, last year, we made dramatic shifts to product mix and cut operating expenses as we managed through avian influenza and a substantial decrease in volume through our system. As we communicated during our fourth quarter call, we knew the first half of the year faced difficult earnings comparisons. However, the erosion in market conditions was deeper and faster than we expected. Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store's profitability this quarter : declining turkey prices, increased expenses and increased competition. We can handle any one of these issues during a given quarter or year, but all three factors in the same quarter created a difficult operating environment that we did not expect. First, turkey prices such as breast meat have fallen over 60% year-over-year to seven year lows, which were much lower than we expected. Jim Sheehan will discuss our outlook for key commodities, but given the industry, now appears to be in an oversupply situation. We do not see near-term relief on commodity prices which will pressure our pricing in the marketplace. Second, we incurred higher operating expenses primarily for bio-security measures in our live production system and lower yields in our plant operations. We will continue to make investments throughout our business, including additional investments in bio-security to protect our business from an avian influenza outbreak. Third, as we have addressed in the past, competing proteins continue to pressure our business in addition to increased competitive pressure. We experienced this across all three sales divisions; foodservice, retail and deli. The team at Jennie-O Turkey Store is taking the appropriate actions to address near-term operating conditions and challenges. We remain very optimistic about the demand for JENNIE-O branded products. We have improved similar turkey commodity cycles before and we always emerge in a stronger position. We will continue to support the brand, deliver innovative new items and invest in the business. Refrigerated Foods had another strong quarter. First quarter operating profit increased 4%, with sales and volume down 3%. As previously announced, we completed the divestiture of the Farmer John business on January 3, 2017. Excluding the divesture, adjusted sales were down 1% while adjusted volume was flat. Refrigerated Foods continues to benefit from growth in both retail and foodservice value-added products. In foodservice, innovative items such as Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel Fire Braised meats delivered solid growth. In our retail business, items such as Applegate bacon and breakfast sausage, Hormel Gatherings party trays, and Hormel Natural Choice meats delivered very nice growth. International operating profits increased 5% while sales decreased 2%. Our fresh pork exports during the quarter were very strong. We did experience a temporary slowdown in our branded export business due to changes in import regulations in certain countries, which have since been resolved. Our SKIPPY business in China performed well while our meat business in China continues to experience high pork raw material prices. Specialty Foods operating profit was flat while sales declined 19% and volume declined 30%. Excluding the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, adjusted sales were up 10% while adjusted volume was up 12%. CytoSport posted growth this quarter, driven by our success in the food, drug, mass, and convenience channels in addition to growth in CytoSport powders. Innovative new items such as Muscle Milk bars and Muscle Milk yogurt smoothies continued to perform well. We saw strong sales growth once again in Grocery Products. Sales were up 7% with volume up 4%. Adjusted sales grew 3% while adjusted volume grew 2%. The addition of Justin's specialty nut butters and strong sales from brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, and SKIPPY all contributed to sales and volume growth. We completed the integration of the Justin's business during the quarter, and the business is on track to meet our valuation expectations. Segment profit for Grocery Products was up 1%. As we look to the remainder of 2017, the balanced model we have intentionally built in our business will allow us to overcome the challenges at Jennie-O Turkey Store. We expect Refrigerated Foods results to be better than we projected for the remaining three quarters. We see continued growth in many of our brands across both retail and foodservice, such as Hormel Natural Choice, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel BACON 1 fully-cooked bacon, and Hormel Fire Braised meats. Grocery Products will continue to build momentum, especially in the back half of the year. We continue to see sales growth aided by product lines such as SKIPPY peanut butter, Justin's specialty nut butters, and our Mexican Foods portfolio. Specialty Foods is expected to perform slightly better than projected for the full year. The team has done an excellent job offsetting the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture. And as a reminder, we will lap the Diamond Crystal Brands divestiture in May. International will perform as planned for the full year. We anticipate strong sales for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, and CytoSport protein products in the International segment for the year. We expect the Jiaxing plant to begin producing products in the third quarter, enabling us to produce SPAM in China for the first time. We also expect relief in China pork prices in the second half of the fiscal year, which will improve the operating environment for our China meat business. We continue to see positive demand trends for JENNIE-O branded products, but market conditions are expected to cause full-year sales to be flat to last year. Percentage declines in earnings for the second quarter will likely be similar to the first quarter, while decreases in the back half of the fiscal year are expected to be in the mid-single digits. While it is early in the year, our assessment of the impact of turkey prices at seven-year lows creates challenges for Jennie-O Turkey Store and the total company's full-year outlook, despite expected growth in other segments. As such, we are adjusting our full-year guidance to $1.65 to $1.71 per share. We are confident in the balance we have purposely built into our business and expect strong performance from our other segments to overcome the market headwinds at Jennie-O Turkey Store. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017. James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Volume for the first quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 2% decrease compared to last year. Sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, a 1% decrease. Excluding Diamond Crystal Brands, Farmer John, and Justin's, volume increased 5% and sales increased 3%. Net earnings for the first quarter were $235.1 million, flat compared to last year. SG&A expenses on a dollar and percentage of sales basis were flat to last year. General corporate expenses were lower in the first quarter compared to last year, primarily on lower employee-related and legal expenses. We expect general corporate expenses to be lower than last year for the balance of the year. Advertising expenses for the quarter were $52 million compared to $48 million last year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $31.3 million compared to $31.8 million last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million for 2017. Equity in earnings for the quarter was $13 million, up 16% compared to last year. The increase was due to strong MegaMex results, including Herdez and Wholly Guacamole brands. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 33.7% compared to 33.6% last year. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%. Cash flow from operations was $178 million, down from $278 million, primarily due to the changes in working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $38 million compared to $33 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $200 million this year. Projects include completion of our plant in China, numerous capacity expansions for our value-added products, and ongoing investments for food and employee safety. We paid our 354th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $0.68 per share. We repurchased nearly 870,000 shares of common stock, spending $31 million in the first quarter. We have 12 million shares remaining from the current authorizations, and we'll continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises. Total company operating margins fell 10 basis points to 15.6% compared to last year. The Jennie-O Turkey Store segment was the primary driver for the reduction. Jennie-O Turkey Store incurred higher expenses, including increases in bio-security measures, upgrades in our facilities, and investments into consumer trends such as our raised-without-antibiotic products. Input costs for the first quarter were mixed. Feed costs were lower compared to last year, but bird yields underperformed. The Jennie-O Turkey Store team continues to make adjustments to improve performance in live production. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect favorable grain prices for 2017. Although we anticipated decreases in turkey markets, the decline, especially in breast meat, was deeper and faster than we expected. Breast meat prices are now down 60% since last year's record levels. Since October, most turkey markets are down 20%. Based on current inventory and production levels, we do not expect a material change to prices for the balance of the year. Beef prices were lower for the quarter, which provided a benefit to many of our value-added products. However, lower beef prices are putting pressure on the ground meat category, including ground turkey. We expect slightly lower beef prices for the full year. Hog and belly prices experienced significant increases in January. Hog prices increased 17% and belly prices increased 20%, 72% pork trim prices were over 20% higher than last year. Higher trim prices and the rapid increase in belly prices created short-term margin pressures for some of our value-added products. Belly prices are being impacted by lower cold storage levels and higher demand for bacon. We project belly prices to be significantly higher compared to last year. We expect pork trim markets to be similar to last year for the balance of the year. Based on the futures market, we expect hog prices to be slightly higher than last year. As we assess the long-term future of the hog industry, we see three areas of focus : export demand, domestic consumption, and total U.S. harvest capacity. The majority of the new harvest capacity is reportedly coming online in late summer to early fall, representing an eventual capacity increase of about 8%. In our opinion, utilization of the additional capacity is dependent on increases in exports and domestic consumption. We will closely monitor the market dynamics as the new capacity comes online. At this time, we believe Hormel is at the right level of capacity given the current market conditions. We are well-positioned to make the necessary adjustments in our business to address changes in the pork industry. We remain confident in our balanced model. While Jennie-O Turkey Store may struggle this year, our growth in our other segments will be able to offset the declines. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens Inc. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Morning, Farha. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: First question is on Jennie-O. Are you able to adjust your internal production to buy more from the outside to take advantage of some of the low prices in the open market? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Farha, Jim Snee here. We do already purchase some meat on the outside, and we do have flexibility at times. But our production cycle is a relatively long production cycle. So the flexibility doesn't really allow you to capitalize on all of that opportunity. But certainly, our team is looking at that and watching those market dynamics and taking advantage of it as they can. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: That's helpful. And then the second question is regarding M&A. I think you have a debt free balance sheet. Could you share with us what opportunities you're seeing out there? And where Hormel's focus is right now? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure, Farha. We're very active on the M&A front. And like most quarters, we feel good about the pipeline we have. For us, the biggest issue continues to be getting it across the finish line. That's always the most difficult part. But as we think about what we are focused on, the need to become more global, businesses or items that afford us the opportunity to become more healthy, holistic, on-the-go, multicultural are all things that are squarely in our wheelhouse. And then we also, of course, are looking for those right opportunities that will add scale or support existing businesses with the idea that we want businesses that are margin accretive, that are one or two in the categories where they compete, and we want to make sure that we're bringing more than just a check that we really can add value to the business. But I think the important thing to understand is that Fred and his team are very active. The pipeline is full, and we'll continue to work hard in that area. Farha Aslam - Stephens, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first continuing in Jennie-O, hoping you could dimensionalize a little bit and you did a little bit this before, but how much of the guidance reduction for the full year was really just the first quarter realized versus a weaker expectation for pricing and maybe some operational stuff in the balance of the year? And then I think you alluded, Jim, in the prepared remarks to Refrigerated, actually the guidance \u2013 the implicit guidance coming up a little bit and any way to \u2013 it was a $0.03 reduction at the total level kind of the Jennie-O decrease versus the Refrigerated increase, and how we should think about the size of the two of those? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure. So, Adam, as we put together our new guidance, on the JOTS side of the business, we do expect in Q2 to see similar decreases that we saw in the first quarter, and of course in half two, we're calling for mid-single digit declines for JOTS. We don't feel like we're being overly optimistic there, we are taking a realistic look at the business. We do expect stronger performance in Refrigerated Foods have very strong value-added sales, we expect that to continue. Specialty Foods group, the business and CytoSport which, of course, includes Muscle Milk, continues to perform well. So we are expecting stronger performance throughout the year. And then, Grocery Products have seen a lot of good sales momentum, we expect that to continue. International, same thing. So, we are expecting that those two business units will meet expectations. And then as we said, when we roll that all up, it's really \u2013 what we tout is our balanced business model that will offset some of those challenging market conditions for JOTS. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then within Refrigerated, I was hoping that the pork packing environment in November and December were exceptional, frankly, and I'm just wondering. Can you talk about the contribution of that to the Refrigerated and I guess the International business a little bit on the export side versus maybe some of the pressures you felt on the belly inflation that you saw in January and how those dynamics impacted the quarter? James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: So, Adam, this is Jim Sheehan. You're right. We did have good market conditions more in the early part of the quarter, for us November, December. What we saw in January was that there was a freezer report that showed that there were some low levels of inventory, especially in the belly areas. And you saw some drastic increases in belly prices, trim prices were up and hogs were up, hogs were up, I think, 17%, bellies were up 20% in that one month alone. So that created some pricing pressure \u2013 short term pricing pressure but as those prices increase so quickly, it's hard to keep up with the pricing. There is generally about a 30-day delay before we can reset our prices and with that type of an increase, it put pressure in Refrigerated Foods. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And if I can just squeeze one final quick one. In Grocery, Justin's, it seems like there was only $13 million of sales in the quarter, I think the guidance for the year was $100 million. Can you just talk about what was going on there? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Yeah. Adam, we did \u2013 that your number is right and for us what it is the seasonality in the business. And we learned through the rollout \u2013 our innovative SKIPPY PB bites items, that once you get past Halloween, there are some seasonality, downturn in the confectionary business. So, it wasn't totally unexpected. But we are on track for the $100 million and the $0.01 EPS accretion this year. So feel really good. I think at its core, the volume for Justin's year-over-year was up 20%. So the business is doing quite well. Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with CLSA. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey, thanks. Good morning. And thank you for the new disclosures in the press release. It's very, very helpful to break that out. I think in the past, you've talked about how ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge to turkey demand as it came back online. Are your views changing on this? Have consumers reacted to the drop in retail beef prices more actively than you previously thought? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Good morning, Jeremy. Jim Snee. I don't know if we've ever said that ground beef wouldn't be a major challenge. They obviously have a very strong position. Our position has been that we've seen growth in ground turkey because it continues to be on trend for consumers. And we expect over time that we are going to see growth in the share. We're going to see growth in the category. Obviously, in any given quarter or any given year you run the risk of the supply cycle, and I think that's what's happened here. Obviously, from a pricing perspective, we've seen some discounts. The one thing that I would point out is that our tray pack volume was still very strong for the quarter. The tray pack volume was up 15%. And so that tells us that the product is on trend with consumers. But ground beef is certainly going to be a challenge for us as we continue, but we feel like we've got the right product connecting with the right consumers. James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: Jeremy, this is Jim Sheehan. One of the things that I'd remind you is with our balanced model, the lower beef prices are providing lower input costs for both Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products, as beef is a major input for both of those segments. So there's a bit of an offset of the challenge in the turkey business. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Just on that point, I think we saw the ramp up in futures, and to a certain extent has continued, for beef that is, throughout the first couple months of 2017. But it almost seems like we're starting to reverse that and turkey is getting more futures support. So are these new numbers just a conservative outlook on 2017? Can we see upside to what you're currently posting at 15% \u2013 16% margins? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: As we looked at the rollup, Jeremy, we really feel like we've done a deep assessment of the business, and this is a realistic outlook for the business. We've got some good strong sales growth even in the first quarter in retail, foodservice, deli. But the fact is there is competition out there, and we understand that. We understand the market dynamics. And so we feel like this guidance is a very realistic look, not only at JOTS, but all of the business segments. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And if I could just squeeze in one last one, we're hearing that some of the plants coming online are having difficulty finding labor, an issue that seems to be pervasive throughout the industry. Can you address that? Can we expect capacity to maybe be a little bit slower than originally thought in terms of the ramp? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: That's a hard one, Jeremy. And we've talked about that a lot in terms of when we've been asked the question about what does it mean to you, one of the things we have responded with is tell us when. And so once we know when this is all going to happen, we'll be able to give you a better answer. And I think labor certainly is one of the variables that comes into the mix. From our perspective, clearly, we've got a great long-term workforce in many of our facilities, so we're well positioned. And so we will be watching the timing of these plants coming online very closely and trying to better understand what that means. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thank you very much. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some color on Refrigerated Foods, specifically with regards to Q2. You said your outlook for the rest of the year was incrementally more bullish than previously. But for Q2, the comparisons are difficult on the fresh pork margin side, and the belly prices have been high. And so I was wondering if you could give us some color on how quickly you're able to pass through those higher belly prices with your bacon pricing, and if you could just give us some sense of the cadence as far as year-on-year for the rest of the year for Refrigerated. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure, Heather. This is Jim Snee. From our perspective, as Jim Sheehan described earlier, we did see a spike in belly prices, and we took appropriate pricing action. It's going to take a little while to work through the system, but we feel really good about our ability to continue to take pricing in that category. We've also seen some competitive pricing action in that category as well, which bodes well, we believe, for our future, especially in bacon. In Refrigerated Foods also, let's not forget about our strong foodservice business. They had another great quarter in the first quarter, and there's no signs of that business slowing down. So we feel really good about that. And so the second quarter should be a good quarter for Refrigerated Foods, and that's what's leading us to say we do expect it to be a stronger performance for the full year. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay. So we should expect Q2 Refrigerated to be up year on year despite the margins we're seeing on the packer side? James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: This is Jim Sheehan, Heather. Again, we're less concerned about the packer margins. We're more concerned about our input costs. So we do expect belly prices to be higher. Trim we think will be similar to last year, so we think it's going to decline a little bit. And hogs, we believe, will still remain a bit high. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay, thank you. James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: So we have those input pressures, but we're confident about Refrigerated Foods. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay, thanks. And on the Jennie-O side, could you give us a sense of where you're seeing the most \u2013 you mentioned breast meat prices being down roughly 60% year on year, and you mentioned there's pricing pressure in all the channels, but is there any specific channel that's seeing the most price pressure? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Heather, I would say it's pretty consistent across retail, foodservice, and deli. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning, everyone. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Good morning, Ken. James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: Good morning. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So when I think about the $0.03 guidance reduction, how does this change your earnings power in 2018 and 2019? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Ken, it's early. First thing, obviously, is we're looking out the balance of the year driven by JOTS. As we get throughout the year, we'll be able to take a closer look at that, but it is early for us to be looking out into 2018 and 2019. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Let me rephrase this a little differently. I'm not looking for guidance. I'm saying, does this change your ability to deliver the 5% and 10% and your margin expansion opportunities in 2018, 2019, and 2020 going out? How much does this structurally change how you think about your business going forward? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Okay, thanks for the clarification, Ken. I don't think that it structurally changes our business going forward. We're obviously in a market cycle. That cycle will correct. And when we think about JOTS in particular, from our perspective, we know that there's history here. History has been on our side. We've seen this in 2003 and in the 2008, 2009 timeframe. In each case, we've emerged stronger. We know that it's important for us to stay disciplined. And JOTS, as you know, it's a key part of our balanced model and a key part of our business. So in terms of structural change, we don't see it, we just have to get through this cycle and we will. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And my next follow-up question to this is, on Refrigerated Foods, you indicated that it's going to be better than expected this year. Again, pork pack margins coming down, belly is higher. Help us understand how your business actually functions because I think those indicators would suggest otherwise, and yet you're saying it's stronger. So, help us understand how this business can actually operate in a subsiding pork packer margin environment. James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: This is Jim Sheehan, Ken. Our Refrigerated Foods segment is the hardest segment to model. And it's difficult to model because of the focus on not only providing raw materials for our own \u2013 their own products in Refrigerated Foods, but it provides products to other businesses, especially International and Grocery Products. For instance, this quarter, fresh pork was actually transferred to International because International margins were greater than the margins that could be attained in fresh pork. So that \u2013 what you're referring to is the packer margin, you're really seeing some of that benefit in International and not in Refrigerated Foods. We had a strong quarter for the value-added products within the division. We're focused on what our input costs are, and I think we've given you some ideas to what input costs are going to be. There will be some commodity benefit. But in general, we think that spread will be offset by higher belly and trim prices. So again, focus on what's happening with the hog markets; what's happening with belly and trim prices. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. So I wanted to just get a little bit more clarification on the turkey shortfall. It looks like \u2013 and your disclosure, again, we really appreciate the extra disclosure. But it looks like profits are going to be off for the year by close to $100 million. But I'm trying to break that down into its components, right? So you said there is competitive pressure, and it looks like competitive pressure can be broken into two things, which is competing needs, and I'm not sure if there are any competing brands that are causing any pressure. But it looks like it's all competing needs. So, can you break down sort of the pressure into buckets, whether it's competing needs and lower turkey prices versus higher costs that are in your control? Like maybe just give us some sense of order of magnitude of those three. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure, Akshay. Jim Snee. So the first part around competition and competitive pressure, I mean, we are seeing it in the markets, or in the meats, as you say, and we are also seeing it from competitors. We're not the only company that was coming back out of AI looking to regain distribution and regain business. So there is an element of market pressure and competitive set pressure. So we are seeing that on both sides. And then when we think about the next piece when you talk about expenses, Jim Sheehan referenced some of the bird performance on the live production side and we know that those are cycles and our team, again, coming out of AI is already working on addressing that in the live production side of the business. So competition does have both parts. The expenses with bird performance. The other thing that we mentioned, which is going to be a very good thing for us over the long-term is our venture into raised without antibiotics. And right now, obviously, we're making investments in that business. We know that it's the right thing to do. And that includes feed, supply chain densities. There's a lot of things too that go into that. And then the last thing, Akshay, and I want to make this part just clear on your opening comment. We are not projecting $100 million decline year-on-year for Jennie-O Turkey Store. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Yes. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: We would expect it to be less than that, more \u2013 maybe half of that. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Yes. I meant relative to what your expectations were. So, yeah. I mean your guidance basically points to a $50 million decline, but relative to what you maybe were expecting before the delta might be that much. But that was helpful. So just want to delve into those issues a little bit more. So when you look at your projections now going forward, have you taken into account, there was \u2013 so I'm at CAGNY, there was a very large competitor in chicken that's getting into the ground poultry business, if I may. Is that included in your guidance? Do you think that's going to have a major impact this year? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Akshay, we saw that release earlier this week as well. Obviously, chicken has been in that space for a long time. And so it's too early to tell. We haven't seen the product, haven't really heard what the consumers think, haven't heard what retailers think. So it's really too early to tell on that specific product line. But clearly we'll be watching it closely. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Just last one. Prior to this quarter you were guiding to \u2013 Refrigerated EBIT growth to be flat for the year. Obviously, now you are saying it's better. Can you give us an order of magnitude how much better? I mean it looks like Refrigerated Food projection being better is the major offset to JOTS being lower. So, it looks like there's a significant positive change in your Refrigerated Food operating margin assumption. But can you just give us some order of magnitude what you expect EBIT growth in Refrigerated Foods for this fiscal year? Thank you. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Thanks, Akshay. Really we've got stronger performance for the balance of the year in both Refrigerated and Specialty Foods. On the Refrigerated side, the big driver there is going to be continued strong value-added sales both on the retail side of the business and continued strong performance from our foodservice team. And then on the Specialty Foods side, like we said, the CytoSport business continues to do well gaining distribution, but also some great, new innovative items that are really starting to take hold in the marketplace. So between those two things, that's really what's going to offset some of the difficult market conditions for JOTS. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. On the Grocery Products side, is it fair to say and I think you broke this out in the release, I'm just trying to clarify that the category was up about it 3.1% on the top-line? And then I guess as a follow-up there, we didn't really see a lot of operating profit growth in that category but we did see a little bit of advertising jump in Q1. Is it fair to say that we expect to harvest some of those advertising investments as we get through the remainder of the year? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Yes, Sean. Jim Snee. That's a fair statement. Really in terms of expenses, obviously, advertising was up on the quarter. There, as you would expect, were expenses associated with the Justin's integration that are one-time expenses. So certainly advertising will play a benefit for the rest of the year. We won't have the ongoing integration charges, but the bigger driver in all of this is really the sales momentum for Grocery Products. And so SKIPPY continues to do really well. Our MegaMex portfolio of products is doing well. And then we do see some favorable market conditions that will help them out and then again the full year benefit of Justin's. So that's really what's driving our outlook for Grocery Products. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, that's great. And then, I guess, a follow-up would be just on the Refrigerated Foods segment. And there's been a lot of discussion about different commodities that are happening out there. But is there anything that you can talk about just in terms of structural changes that have been made in this segment? And I'm thinking specifically about the mix of sales and value-added versus commodity within that segment which may limit some of the downside pressure that you may have experienced 5 years to 10 years ago. Just any sort of delta in the value-add there. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: I think, Sean, we've talked a lot about the continued growth, the migration up the value ladder, if you will, in our Refrigerated Foods segment, and it occurs not just in packaged items. We're doing it across the entire Refrigerated Foods organization, in fresh pork, in meat products. It's happening everywhere. And so we'll continue to work on that, and we've been very successful. The other part to really consider is the, once again, strong growth of our foodservice business. That's a business that continue to deliver quite well for our organization. We don't expect that to slow down. And then a lot of the innovation work that we are doing in on-the-go with our party trays and some of our other items that we've developed. So is it a structural difference? It certainly is a structural shift, and we will continue to be working on that so that we do eliminate volatility over the long-term. Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. I think most of the questions have been asked here. But two things. Just a follow-up to Ken Zaslow's question about your long-term margin aspirations. I think we need to hear it from you, Jim. Are you adhering to that long-term goal of being in your top quartile of your peer group and the range being 15% to 19%? Can you stick with that? And then the second thing, just more a technical thing. I think you said tray pack sales up 15% in Jennie-O. Is that a true consumer demand number, or does that also reflect just being on shelf more with an easy comparison to the AI from last year? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure. Thanks, Rob. So to your first question, the answer is yes. We are committed to that long-term margin guidance, and clearly the impact of Jennie-O on just this one quarter moved us back a little bit. But we do believe that this business is going to rebound and will emerge stronger and it's going to be a key part of that journey in the margin improvement. So the answer is yes. We are committed to that. And to your second question, certainly there are elements of both, right? I think we are still probably gaining back some distribution, but you're gaining back distribution because there's consumer demand. And so again, the underlying fundamental there is we feel really good about the business, it's connecting with consumers and it's on trend, and we expect to continue to do that. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So I had two questions just related to your recent acquisitions. So first on Justin's, do you still believe you can achieve the $100 million sales target for this fiscal year? And then on Applegate, I was just curious how that's performing versus expectations. And as you look at the environment, clearly seeing deflation in more of the conventional offering, just wondering if that's at all challenging the Applegate offering. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure, Rupesh. Good morning, Jim Snee. Yeah, just following up on the earlier question around Justin's, the $13 million in the first quarter does account for some seasonality in the business in the whole confectionary space. But we do want to point out that the volume is up 20% year over year. And so we do believe that we're on track for $100 million for the full year and still remain very positive about that acquisition and that business going forward. And as you get to the Applegate business, our team there continues to work through the rebound of the supply situation, both on the pork side, and then that was compounded with turkey supply shortages through AI. And as you think of that business in specific parts of the store, the walled deli space is extremely competitive. The team's making progress there, but that's been a battle. Really a lot of continued success in the meat case and the freezer. Hot dogs, dinner sausage, the nuggets, the chicken breakfast sausage, those items are doing well. And we're working now on developing business in the foodservice channel as well. So we think that that business is very healthy and going to continue to do well. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for getting me worked into the Q&A. Really a follow-up on the grocery sector, Jim and Jim. When you look at certain commodities, obviously you've had some cost inflation with avocados. You've got trim costs. Is that leading to some higher pricing in your guacamole and maybe even your SPAM division? I think guacamole prices have actually gone up a little bit. And then can you just talk about \u2013 your revenue growth is really strong there and I would think that that would be more of a positive mix, with SKIPPY growing, et cetera. So obviously with one-time expenses in the quarter, it held back your margins and your profits this quarter. But isn't there also a positive mix shift going on here as well for grocery which would be beneficial to margins as you move forward? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Sure. Eric, good morning, Jim Snee. Thanks for those questions. I'll try to break those down here. So the first one around avocados \u2013 and you are correct. We have taken pricing increases on Wholly Guacamole. And those prices have been in the marketplace a little while now, but consumer demand remains strong for the products. In terms of the avocado market, there are a couple of things. Prices are historically high, but they are down from some of their October peaks. The other thing to understand is that there is adequate supply. And so we have a number of \u2013 or a lot of the supply that comes out of Mexico, but we have other sources for supply as well. So there's adequate supply in that space. And we again feel really good about the business going forward. From a Grocery Products perspective, our guidance is consistent with what we laid out in the fourth quarter call. And so the business is very healthy, a lot of sales momentum. And you're right, once you get through some of these one-time expenses, we'll be able to deliver the guidance we laid out. And yeah, there is a mix shift (53:56), a mix shift as we think about the Justin's and SKIPPY and all of those product lines that really continue to build a nice broad base in the Grocery Products portfolio. So we feel really good about what Grocery Products is doing and where they're headed. Eric Larson - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, thank you, Jim. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Hi, Mario. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I just wanted to follow up on the 5% sales growth target that had been laid out in the previous quarter, 5% excluding M&A. I didn't really hear much mention of that today. So my first question would be, is that intact? And then if it is, what's going to allow you to get to that? It would require some amount of acceleration over the upcoming quarters here. You're not going to have the benefit of the turkey supply normalization. That will have already been lapped at some point this year. So is there any additional detail you can provide on that? Thank you. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: I think we're on track for the 5% organic growth number. As you go around all of the different business segments, Refrigerated Foods, the strong value-added sales will continue to deliver there. JOTS will be slightly lower. We are going to see some volume growth, but obviously we understand the market conditions. Specialty Foods will continue to perform well. And then International, Grocery Products are all on track for what we said they were going to do. So we do believe, Mario, that we're going to be able to deliver that 5% organic number. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And I guess, is there any specific segment that is going to contribute more than what we've seen so far? Or is it going to be fairly evenly balanced? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: I mean, I think, we've said our stronger performance will come from Refrigerated and Specialty, but there's some really nice sales momentum in Grocery Products, and we don't expect that to slow down. Mario Contreras - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much. That's all for me. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Thanks, Mario. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with CLSA. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Just on that point, your organic growth in Specialty has been very, very strong and it's a little bit different than what we are tracking. So, if you can just point to that, what's your \u2013 I know you're just kind of bottling up all the different segments to get to your 5% number but could you give some indication on what Specialty Foods organic volume growth could be this year? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Specialty Foods, you've got to remember that that's still a mix of CytoSport, HHL and our Specialty Products group. And so when we talk about that business, we are talking across all those different categories that are performing well. So I think we expect that business to continue to be strong, and even within that segment there's a bit of a balance that goes on at any given time. We've seen some nice growth with CytoSport in some more traditional channels. Remember, the C-store business, which is a big part of the CytoSport business, isn't measured. And the team's done a great job not only gaining distribution but creating innovative new items to meet the needs of that channel. So it's all of those things that are really setting it up for a strong 2017. Jeremy Scott - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just had a quick question on exports. Historically, Hormel has not been a big exporter on the pork side, but you guys mentioned that this quarter they were strong. I was wondering, the Chinese pork market continues to be strong but it has cooled some. So, should we expect that strong export volume to continue for the rest of the year? Or how should we think about that? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Heather, just a reminder, fresh pork exports are \u2013 they are a decent-sized part of the International business. They're not, I would say, a huge part of the overall company. And on any given year, obviously, we've had strength and then we've had some challenges with pricing pressure with products coming out of the European markets the last several years. But it does look like the markets are setting up for a strong full year. Certainly, you've got the China conditions, but I think we've also all read what's happened, or what is happening in South Korea, which is a strong export market for us. So I mean we do feel like it'll continue to be strong throughout the year. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : But am I correct in thinking and maybe I misunderstood this because the industry as a whole, it's roughly a quarter of the volume goes to export. I had thought that Hormel's \u2013 their exposure was less than that, but are you all in line with the industry? James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: No, we're less than that, Heather. Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have one final question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. Just on turkey, can you just help me understand the dynamics of lower commodity prices on your portfolio, because 80% or so is value-added, so lower commodity needs should be good for a majority of your business? So I'm just a little bit \u2013 I'm trying to understand why that is causing such a big impact negatively on your margins. Thank you. James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: Akshay, this is Jim Sheehan. And really what's happening with that lower commodity prices are the pricing pressure that it's putting on to the sales price. So that's really where we're feeling the impact. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Right. But on to \u2013 because you are value-added, typically you would be able to have a better margin, right? Your inputs, when you are doing value-added, are down so your end price shouldn't be coming down as much, right, typically. So I guess... James N. Sheehan - Hormel Foods Corp.: I think to understand what occurred in the first quarter, one of the things that you shouldn't lose sight on is the bird performance, because the birds that we raise, we've talked about that we had some additional costs in those flocks. The flocks that we raised cost more and then they provided less meat than they typically will provide, and especially less breast meat. So the cost of raising the birds was the same price. Yes, there is some advantage in the commodity prices for breast meat that we're buying on the outside, but it's really the pricing pressure. Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies LLC : Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. Operator : And there are no additional questions at this time, gentlemen. James P. Snee - Hormel Foods Corp.: Great. Well, thank you all very much. While unfavorable market conditions in the turkey industry challenged our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, the balance we have intentionally built into all of our businesses allowed us to deliver earnings growth this quarter. Our team has a track record of delivering results, and we clearly understand what needs to be done this year to deliver the guidance range we provided. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted sales and volume. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today we announced second quarter results of $0.39 per share, down 2.5% from last year. Sales for the quarter were down 5% on an 11% decrease in volume. Adjusted sales grew 2% while adjusted volume grew 1%. For the quarter, three of our five segments reported earnings growth. Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products grew earnings, while Specialty products earnings were down 16%. We frequently talk about the intentional balance we've built into our business and this quarter demonstrates the value of our balance model. Even though we had double-digit declines in our very important business at Jennie-O Turkey Store and divested two profitable but non-strategic businesses, we delivered earnings within $0.01 of last year's results. We were able to do this through impressive results from our meat products, foodservice, grocery products and international teams. In addition, all of our teams proactively managed expenses. Now I would like to talk through each of our segments. Jennie-O Turkey Store had another difficult quarter compared to last year with earnings down 29%. Sales were down 8% and volumes were down 6%. Segment profit margins declined from over 21% in the second quarter last year to 16% this year, similar to the first quarter. Three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey Store\u2019s profitability this quarter versus the same time last year : Declining turkey prices; increased competition; and increased expenses. First, turkey prices such as breast meat have maintained their seven year lows and in some cases declined further since the first quarter as the industry continues to be in an oversupply situation. History suggests that turkey industry will balance supply and demand and market conditions will improve in the coming months. In turn, we have made additional adjustments to our production levels and would expect volumes slightly under 2014 levels. The impact to our business continues as commodity sales pricing and whole bird pricing is much lower than last year. Lower turkey prices are also pressuring prices in Jennie-O Turkey Store\u2019s three sales divisions : retail, deli, and foodservice. Second, increased competitive activity from other turkey suppliers and competing proteins such as beef continue to pressure Jennie-O\u2019s results. Third, we incurred higher operating expenses primarily related to bird performance issues with both our conventional flocks and those raised without antibiotics. We continue to make investments into consumer trends such as our raised-without-antibiotics products. Despite the market conditions and operating challenges, the Jennie-O Turkey Store team grew value added volumes 1% this quarter and also grew lean ground turkey tray pack volume by double digits. Recent twelve week scan data shows positive sales trends as the Jennie-O brand continues to outperform the category. This week we announced plans to build a new production facility in Melrose, Minnesota primarily to process whole birds. This new facility will replace the current aged Melrose facility and is expected to cost over $130 million. While our emphasis at Jennie-O Turkey Store is on value added products, whole birds are an important part of the turkey supply chain. The new plant will increase operational efficiency through an improved layout and will also automate some of the most difficult production jobs. Construction begins this year and we expect the plant to be operational in early 2019. Grocery Products operating profit was up 15%. Volume was up 2% and sales were up to 8%. The inclusion of Justin's specialty nut butters and brands such as Wholly Guacamole, SPAM and Herdez, all contributed to growth. International operating profit increased 38% on volume growth of 17% and sales growth of 19%. Fresh pork exports and branded exports such as SPAM had excellent results this quarter. Our SKIPPY peanut butter business in China also performed well. Refrigerated foods second quarter operating profit was flat with sales down 6% and volume down 14%. The decreases reflect the divestiture of the Farmer John business in January of this year. Excluding the divestiture, adjusted sales were up 5% and adjusted volume was up 1%. Growth continues to come from retail and foodservice value added products. In foodservice, items such as Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon and Hormel pepperoni delivered excellent growth during the quarter. In our retail business, Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel Natural Choice meats and Applegate bacon and dinner sausage delivered nice growth. Specialty foods operating profit declined 16%. Sales declined 24% and volume declined 33%. Excluding the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands, adjusted volume was up 3% while adjusted sales were flat. Muscle Milk ready to drink protein beverages performed well, especially in the food, drug and mass channels. Our Muscle Milk powder business was softer this quarter which is in line with the category dynamics. In addition, our new Muscle Milk bars have been well received in the marketplace. Given our current operating environment, we have made some short-term reductions to SG&A expenses. One such area is advertising. Advertising expense this quarter was $30 million compared to $49 million in 2016. This level of advertising is comparable to our fiscal 2015 spend. The majority of the advertising reductions came from the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. To maintain our advertising and promotional spend efficiency, some of these advertising dollars have shifted to in-store promotions but we still remain the price leader. Looking to the balance of fiscal 2017, the only change to our outlook is for Jennie-O Turkey Store. We now expect percentage declines in earnings for Jennie-O Turkey Store to be in the high-teens for the second half of the year with the pressure not abating until the entire industry starts to reduce production levels. For Refrigerated Foods, we expect growth in many of our retail brands, particularly Hormel Black Label bacon and Hormel Natural Choice meats. We expect growth in the foodservice channel to remain strong with growth coming from many of our brands such as Hormel Bacon 1 and Hormel Fire Braised meats. We see continued sales and earnings growth from grocery products. Justin's specialty nut butters, Wholly Guacamole dips, Herdez sauces and SKIPPY peanut butter are all expected to be strong contributors to this growth. The full year outlook for the International segment is for growth in line with their long-term goals of 10% top line and 15% bottom line. We expect strong exports of both branded and fresh pork products. Our new manufacturing facility in Joshing [ph], China will start producing products early in the third quarter and we also expect relief for China pork prices in the second half of the fiscal year which will improve the operating environment for our China retail meat business. We look to specialty foods to deliver double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year, driven by CytoSport and the Muscle Milk brand. As a reminder, we will annualize the divestiture of Diamond Crystal Brands early in the third quarter. Based on our updated outlook for Jennie-O Turkey Store, we are maintaining our full year earnings per share guidance of $1.65 to $1.71, and expect earnings to be at the lower end of the range. At this time I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017. James Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. Volume for the second quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, an 11% decrease compared to last year. Sales for the second quarter were $2.2 billion, a 5% decrease. Excluding the acquisition of Justin's and the sale of Diamond Crystal and Farmer John, adjusted volume increased 1% and adjusted sales increased 2%. Net earnings for the quarter were $211 million, down 2% compared to last year. General corporate expenses were lower in the second quarter primarily due to reduced employee related expenses and higher allocations to the business units. We expect general corporate expenses to be below last year for the remainder of the year. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $32 million, unchanged from last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $125 million for 2017. Equity in earnings for the quarter was $10 million, up 6% compared to last year. Strong results for MegaMex including the Herdez and Wholly Guacamole brands drove the increase. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 33.2% compared to 33.6% last year. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 33% and 33.5%. As a reminder, we experienced an unusually low tax rate in the third quarter of last year which was a result of international restructuring. Cash flow from operations was $84 million, down from $130 million last year. The decrease was primarily related to changes in working capital. Capital expenditures totaled $39 million compared to $66 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $190 million this year. Projects include completion of our plant in China, the new plant in Melrose, capacity expansion for value added product lines, and ongoing investments for food and employee safety. We paid our 355th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15, at the annual rate of $0.68 per share. We repurchased 547,000 shares of common stock, spending $19 million. We have 12 million shares remaining from the current authorization and will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on the internal valuation of the stock. Operating margins were 14.5%, a 40 basis point increase compared to last year. Four of our five segments increased operating margins. Input costs for the second quarter were mixed. Beef costs were slightly higher compared to last year. Barring any unforeseen weather events, we expect beef costs to trend below last year in the second half. Breast meat and other turkey commodity prices remained at seven year lows. Based on inventory and production levels, we do not expect material changes in prices until the industry starts to cut back production. Hog prices in the second quarter were similar to last year. We expect to see some short-term volatility in the hog markets in the second half. Overall hog prices are expected to be higher than last year. Belly prices increased sharply in the first part of the quarter but are now comparable to last year. On average belly prices were approximately 10% higher than last year. We expect belly prices to be above last year as the industry continues to experience lower cold storage levels and high demand for bacon. 73% pork trim prices were 10% above last year. We expect trim markets to remain above last year for the second half. Prices for 50% beef trim were over 20% higher for the quarter. We expect beef prices to remain high for the second half with a possible downward trend in our fourth quarter. The new hog harvest capacity is coming online. Two plants recently began production and two additional plants are expected to start production by late summer. The additional capacity represents an increase of about 6%. We believe hog supplies are positioned to closely match this increase as the USDA projects a 4% to 5% increase in the hog supply for 2017. As we assess the long-term future of the hog industry, we see three areas of focus : export demand, domestic consumption, and total U.S. harvest capacity. Year-to-date export demand has been strong. The USDA expects exports to be up 10% in 2017. Domestic consumption also remained strong. For example, pork feature activity has increased significantly and pricing has been stable. Depending on the long term export and domestic consumption trends, we believe rationalization of less efficient harvest operations may need to occur. We remain confident we're well positioned to make the necessary adjustments in our business to address changes in pork capacity. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Thanks for taking my question. So I want to discuss with Jennie-O Turkey Store segment in a little more detail. I was just curious when you look historically how long does it typically take for the industry to reduce production levels? Jim Snee : Good morning Rupesh. What we've said is, I mean, we believe this cycle is a twelve to eighteen months cycle. We don't know, we can't predict exactly when others in the industry will make a production cut. I do think one of the things that we have to remember is that there still are improvements that can happen along the way in that 12 to 18 months in terms of commodity pricing, competitive activity. So I mean that's how we're looking about -- looking at it and thinking about it. Rupesh Parikh : And then my related follow-up question, as you look at \u2013 as we look at your guidance for the back half of the year, what do you assume for turkey prices, do you assume we've bottomed now or do you assume they continue to get worse? Jim Snee : So from our perspective, I mean, we've built in the downside that we think can occur but from our perspective we believe that there could be some improvements in the back half of the year. But again as far as timing when that happens that's really hard to predict. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Just continuing on the turkey side, just \u2013 two questions I have. One is the short term, and one is the longer term. So on the short term what prompted you to change -- I mean, I get to profitability but you guys totally reversed course on your volume side, it is my understanding. So how much was that just because, hey, look the environment is that bad that we're just going to cut so we\u2019re going to change that? And then my second question which is actually probably more important, is okay, so with seven year low turkey prices, 2017 will probably be your fourth best year ever in turkey still. So how does this change your longer term view of the turkey operation in terms of 2018 and 2019, does this change your margin structure, is this something that we should \u2013 there is a structural issue here, can you talk about that as well? Jim Snee : Sure. Thanks, Ken. From our perspective the shorter term issue as we've looked at the business, starting with production, we have planned reductions for our fiscal year, some mid single digit reductions that really allow us to be a net buyer of breast meats. We did take further reductions in half one in response to the market conditions. You can say those are probably low single digits and that would put us for the full year slightly lower than 2014. Beyond that for the short term, I don't know that I would say we've changed course. And what we have seen is continued low commodity prices and others in the industry have not cut back yet but we haven't seen a change in competitive activity, still very strong and this is unique to us but clearly we\u2019ve still seen some increased expenses in terms of bird performance, our investments that we're making which we believe are on trend with our WOA and of course the ongoing investment in biosecurity. So I mean that's the short term view. From our perspective on the long term side, I mean there is nothing structurally wrong with this business, I mean, these changes are -- they are market based, they are not fundamental issues to the business. And we said this on our first quarter call is whether good or bad we've been here before and we have emerged stronger as an organization. So we feel really good with our ability to deliver long term growth in this business and it's still about being able to drive value added sales. So we've been very pleased with the growth in our lean ground turkey up double digit this quarter, scan data that shows we're outperforming the category. So lots of good positive trends that set us up really well for the long term. Operator : We'll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Maybe first at the corporate level, just trying to sense -- last quarter I think you talked to a full year outlook about 5% organic growth, for the year -- year to date you're running a little bit under 3, a bit around 2 for the quarter and you've got \u2013 you\u2019re lapping an extra week in your fiscal fourth quarter with the Jennie-O reductions that you have outlined for the back half, do you have an updated thought on the sales view and any color by business would be helpful? Jim Snee : Sure Adam. Obviously the driver has been the jobs performance. As we go around the horn and we think about all of our businesses for the back half of the year, we believe our grocery product sales will stay in line with their long term growth goal of plus 3% and then plus the addition of the acquired Justin\u2019s business. Refrigerated Foods, on an adjusted basis, would be in the low single digit range. For JOTS we are calling continued decreases in that mid single digit range. Specialty foods group will be positive mid single digits and international will be on track to deliver their long term stated growth goal of 10% sales growth. So really aside from the JOTS business we feel really good about the other four segments. Adam Samuelson : And then I want to go back to some comments in the prepared remarks that you made about pork harvest capacity on the packing side, and maybe the industry actually needing to rationalize some capacity long term, and you even alluded to, you needed to re-evaluate -- you might need to reevaluate your own capacity there. Maybe elaborate on that view little bit and do you view your pork packing capacity is higher cost relative to the industry or do you see less of a need for that vertical integration in your own business? Maybe a little more thought on how the pork harvest capacity fits in with the Hormel strategy relative to some of the increases in industry capacity that\u2019s going on? James Sheehan : Well we constantly review our capacity. We've recently sold Farmer John which obviously reduced our capacity in the harvest level. We make changes to our harvest capacity on a regular basis. We look at it on a daily basis, we increase and decrease our harvest levels. We harvest hogs to provide a supply of raw materials for our value added products. We do that because of the consistency of the products that we attain by harvesting the hogs themselves and honestly we do it on a very economic basis. We have -- we purchase hogs that are very focused to be used in value added products which sometimes are slightly different than what you might see in the open market. We do purchase bellys, trims and at times ribs in the open market, we've been successful with that in the past. So I guess the answer to your question is that we look at our harvest levels on a daily basis both short term and long term by looking at our harvest levels. Operator : We'll go next to Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi, this is a technical question on the cash flow in the quarter, if I'm not mistaken it was pretty far below last year. Can you give us some color on the factors driving that and what do you expect cash flow to look like this year? James Sheehan : Certainly. In the quarter there are a couple of things that drove the change. There were tax payments, about $30 million in additional tax payment and that's really just a timing issue. It has to do with how we make our estimated federal income tax payments, we expect that that will come back to us in both the third and the fourth quarter. So that again is more of a timing issue. We also saw some variation in our workers -- in our accruals around some of our expenses, again more of a timing issue as to when they're paid during the year as opposed to the level of expense. We saw increases in dividends and share repurchase, that was about $25 million. But we also saw a lower CapEx expense. CapEx is supposed to come at about -- we expect it to come at about $190 million. That is the primary driver of what would change the CapEx, as we get later in the year we start to understand what projects are going to get completed in the year, what projects you're going to have investments in. So we don't see any significant change to our cash flow. We still see the company as having a very strong cash flow. Robert Moskow : And I just have a follow up, Jim and Jim. It just sounded a little inconsistent to hear the company talk about reducing Jennie-O production in the back half but then also talk about the renovation at Melrose, and $130 million of CapEx to build -- I know it's a further processing facility, so I guess it's different but do you view this as -- I don't know, how do I reconcile these two things? Is this a bet on 2019 being a much better year from a turkey perspective when you're fully operational? And then secondly the industry experts I talk to think that it's not going to be a 2018 recovery for turkey, it probably will be 2019 based on the fact that everyone seems to continue to increase production this year. Why are they increasing production even though results are that bad? And now that's a lot of questions but maybe you can help me out. Jim Snee : It is. But we will try to get to all of them. I think first, starting with the facility, and so well what we've said here is we are replacing a very aged facility in Melrose. And it is more for whole birds and that is a very -- I guess that we are focused on the value added business, I mean that's our long term growth driver but whole birds are still an integral part of the business. And so this isn't a bet that we're making, I mean this is an investment to update the facility to modernize the facility, make it more efficient. So we do feel like it sets us up well for the future and I mean the other thing to consider is that there is a positive NPV and this is a replacement facility. As you think about the production side of the business, there's increased production because you\u2019ve had a lot of people who were uncertain about avian influenza. And so there was a chance throughout the year that you could have another outbreak, so you had people ramping up on production. As we move further in the year and we never say never but obviously it's less likely -- I think that's when you could see some production cuts. The other thing that I would say, Rob, is that there will be improvements along the way. If you want to think about when does it get back to more normalized or historical levels entirely, that will be hard to predict, we've said twelve to eighteen months. But I do think the other piece to consider is that there will be improvements along the way as commodity prices improves you see some more rational competitive activity and we've seen what's happened in some beef markets already. So I think all of those things will impact it and for us it\u2019s the right long term on trend business to be in and there is nothing structurally wrong with the business. These are all market-based issues not fundamental issues. Robert Moskow : And one last question, you filed a shelf placement recently, can you tell us the rationale for that? James Sheehan : That was just a routine extension of the debt. It was expired and we've reviewed it. Operator : Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning. I wanted to ask about the refrigerated foods. Thanks for the update on the capacity. So you mentioned 6% increase -- can you clarify if that's one shift for all four plants and when exactly you expect that sort of 6% increase to be effective, I guess because you mentioned a couple of plants have opened now, a couple are going to open later. Do you have a sense roughly as to when that 6% will be sort of effective? And I have a follow-up to that. James Sheehan : Thank you, Akshay. 6% is for 2017 and I don't have any inside information about how those plants are operating or how fast they\u2019ll come up to speed. So there will be additional capacity that will come online in 2018 but the 6% addresses the capacity -- the stated capacity that will come online in 2016, so I can\u2019t provide any further information on the ramp up. The USDA is stating that there will be enough hogs to provide that production -- at that production level. It is part of the reason that we've told you -- we might see some short term volatility in the hog prices as \u2013 if the plants are delayed or if they start up faster than they thought that can create a very short term volatility in the market. We've seen that as some other plants have come online but again we see those as very short term and not real trends. Akshay Jagdale : So just so I understand your math, you\u2019re just saying the daily capacity of these plants is x, if you look at that relative to what the daily capacity was before it's a 6% increase, it's not \u2013 you\u2019re not doing any sort of weighted average calculation there because it\u2019s coming \u2013 Jim Snee : No, we are not; that is correct. And the information that we're using is the stated information from those groups building the plants. Akshay Jagdale : And so as it relates to that expansion we understand the difficulty of modelling any of that. But can you just help us understand your base case for 2017, is that hog prices set up for the rest of the year, remain flattish year over year, because they've moved up but they're somewhat still below year ago? So with the capacity coming online, what's your expectation for the next two quarters in terms of the hog prices at sort of flattish year over year or \u2013 Jim Snee : Slightly higher; we don't believe that the plants coming online will have any long term impact on the prices of hogs. Again we believe that there could be some short term volatility but that's going to be very short term based on daily or weekly needs of hogs. Akshay Jagdale : And just one last one on turkey and I know we had discussed this in private as well. But just overall the turkey business that you have is value added, right? And so there's a lot of conversation today and the last couple of quarters on commodity prices. I know there was \u2013 these three factors that are impacting the performance there. But I mean over time, because you're so value added, aren\u2019t you more -- shouldn't you be more and more insulated from commodity moves? Can you just address that sort of broader question? I mean I understand that quarter to quarter over six month period there can be some disconnects but one of the major issues you have is your cost of raising turkey is much higher and you have less pounds but the price itself long term you should be able to manage through that, right? Jim Snee : Yes, I think, Akshay, in a nutshell what you're saying is correct. I mean over the long term -- I mean we are a value added business. Once again we demonstrate that in the face of a tough operating quarter by being able to deliver double digit growth for lean ground and positive scan data, and still a very very profitable business. But I mean that doesn't mean we're immune to market conditions and competitive activity. So you've got a situation where we've got competing proteins, we know the first half of the year what the market was like for beef. So there certainly is market pressure that comes into play but through it all I mean we remain the price leader in the categories where we compete. It's a very profitable business that\u2019s focused on long term value added growth and again these are short term market based issues, not structural or fundamental issues to the long term viability of the business. Operator : Our next question comes from Farha Aslam with Stephens, Incorporated. Farha Aslam : So again on Jennie-O, my first kind of question is around there. We\u2019ve seen turnkey excess come down in the calendar first quarter of this year. Turkey excess were up 9% and here so far in the second calendar quarter we're down to flat. So the industry's cutting. How much do you think turkey excess need to go down for this recovery to happen and your twelve to eighteen months kind of target, when is the start date that we should use for that 12 to 18 months in your mind? James Sheehan : So as we look at that whole placement, it looks like it's down 3% to 5%, so we expect it to be down I guess I should say 3% to 5%. If you look at the inventory levels that just came out -- the freezer inventories that just came out this week, freezer inventories of breast meat are up over 50% above last year. So there still needs to be some clearing through the market of this excess inventory. Jim Snee : And I think in terms of the twelve to eighteen months, Farha, the bigger issue there and what I've said several times already is this idea that we will see improvements along the way both in the market and of course in our own business. And so we don't have today a starting line in terms of when the clock would set but for us it's more about the improvements that we know we'll see. And I think we've done the right things in terms of how we had planned reductions at the beginning of the year proactively managing our own business by taking further reductions in half one. So we're doing the right things to set ourselves up for improvements and clearly that could be accelerated by others in the industry doing the same. Farha Aslam : Yeah, clearly the industry is already responding. But then it looked your earnings for this year, they're essentially coming in plus or minus last to last year, when you look out into 2018, with all the puts and takes, do you anticipate earnings growth, do you anticipate being able to get back to your historical targeted algorithm of 5% top line growth and 10% EPS growth. Jim Snee : In terms of specific guidance for 2018 it's obviously too early. As we think about our business just in real general terms, our business is solid. We've got market impacts -- market based impacts impacting Jennie-O but there's a solid foundation. This intentional balance that we've built throughout our portfolio has allowed us to offset some of the devastating impact to jobs. This is the what if scenario but if JOTS is flat with year ago our business is up double digit on the bottom line. So that doesn't do anything to the results but it just shows you how solid our business is and how strong that balance is. But I mean we do believe that we will get through this and we will be able to deliver our long term growth algorithm of 5% and 10%. Operator : Our next question comes from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Just I have a follow-up question on your SG&A expenses. So you mentioned that basically there was a huge reduction in advertising from roughly $50 million last year to $30 million, so that's about $20 million. Taking a look at what you reported on SG&A, there is a decrease by about $30 million on a quarter over quarter but also on a year over year basis. So my question is I understand that you're likely to be a little more cautious on advertising especially on the Jennie-O side for the remainder of the year. But can we assume that more from the long run that that roughly 10 million savings is something recurring. Do you think there is an opportunity to service a bond and what's your expectation in terms of SG&A for the back half of the year. If you want to express it as a percentage of sales so more in absolute terms, it's just to get a little bit of a sense of how much more savings potential you might have on the U.S. side? Thank you. James Sheehan : Thanks for the question. You're right, our SG&A is down $30 million year over year, 19% million of that is advertising. We also experienced lower employee related expenses including the loss of the expenses related to the businesses that have been sold. But we've made other cuts around employee related expenses. We're very tight, we're looking at any changes in inventory levels or in employee levels very closely. We've taken a very proactive approach to expense manage due to the market conditions. We've focused on a great doctrines that will not harm long term growth, there are many examples of things that we've done that have managed expenses in this market condition. We've had sales meetings that that have been held on conference calls instead of the big meetings we've looked at how many people are going to conferences. We've reduced travel. Now those things are going to be needle movers but I think it's just the sense of attention to every expense that's going through the system and it's not only going on now but it's so that it's something that we use to play in to continue in the future. So we're very focused on expenses and I think this is a good time to refocus the staff about making sure that every dime is being spent wisely and efficiently. Benjamin Theurer : And the $19 million that was related to the advertising as of now but is that something towards the end of the year, i.e. 4Q into what\u2019s mostly a more strong quarter throughout the year, do you expect advertising to pick up by then again just to well map lose market share in the different segments or is that something you would try to maintain in terms of spending what we had 2Q the rest of the year. Jim Snee : Benjamin, just to reiterate I mean the advertising reductions that we've made are short term reduction things. I mean we've been again very public and intentional about how we do support our brands and how important that is to us but in the short term reduction is the majority again have come from job. And not all of them have translated through to the bottom line some of the JOTS in particular shifted to trade to maintain on shelf competitiveness on shelf positions but remember even with that we're still the price leader. So we in these levels are comparable to 2015 and we have -- we have flax our advertising dollars before. For this, this has happened and we are committed to a long term growth and long term brand building. And just want to reiterate that we are absolutely committed to our brands and that the short term reduction is not putting them at risk. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones with The Vertical Group. Heather Jones : I hate to beat a dead horse but I have a question on Jennie-O. And was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of the profitability pressure you experience right now is due to things like your liveability issues with NAE, et cetera because from what I understand most of the industry is still making money and I understand you all are if not to the best producer in the industry among the best, and your margins are still strong. So it doesn't seem like anyone's dire straits right now. So I was just wondering if you give us a sense of how much thanks like your operating expenses being higher and then once you regained some of the shelf space last turn AI, how much that could help your earnings as opposed to the industry cutting production. Jim Snee : I think you're correct, I mean earnings are still there, and are still strong. We are a very proud -- Jennie-O it was still a very profitable business for us, without getting too specific probably just more along the order of magnitude in terms of what\u2019s having the greatest impact. The first one would be market conditions; second, would be pricing pressure; and then third would be our own increased expenses. So we are battling, it's a battle for us to maintain price competitiveness to maintain their shelf space but those are all the right fundamental things that were missed, these market conditions change that are going to set us up. We continue to make investments and are raised without antibiotics program, that is on trend with consumers and rather than make the cut this year we know that it's something that's going to set us up for the long term, so we will continue to invest in. Heather Jones : And going back to an earlier question on the refrigerated food side, so you guys are not sure that belly, trim and to a lesser extent rips. From my understanding the industry, your plants that you have remaining I believe it's two. They\u2019re pretty efficient plants and so they don't seem to be two of the candidates to be shuttered when you were mentioned less efficient facilities. However do you think -- would you ever entertain the idea of simply just stop moving to buying primals for your value added business as opposed to being in the hog slaughter part of the business? Jim Snee : We harvest hogs as a source of raw materials for our value added business and so I mean we see great value and being able to harvest those hogs ourselves gives us a level of control as I said earlier. And so that that's a business that we plan to remain it. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Larson with The Buckingham Research. Eric Larson : Good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in here. Jim, I want to go back to really the pork markets. And we all know all important the export markets are for keeping a favorable balance in the U.S. In the U.S. market particularly given the amount of pork that we've been seeing coming into the market the last few years. We're now -- looks like we are going to be negotiating now Mexico is a huge partner for us on pork products particularly ham so. I'm not really sure if it makes much difference. I mean Mexico\u2019s already moved to get corn from Argentina, Brazil, not much but they're moving. I am not sure makes much difference but I'm interested in your perspective in general and PCM \u2013 on the export markets in general and if NAFTA can have any kind of an impact on the dynamics of those export markets? Jim Snee : Eric, NAFTA is certainly an interesting agreement. And the large driver of the whole agreement is agricultural products, I mean that's the benefit that the U.S. gets from those agreements with Mexico and Canada. So again I'm not going to make a prediction as to what that is going to look like in the future. But I have a hard time believing that it's going to go away entirely. I think we'll see some renegotiation but we'll still be able to benefit from those neighboring markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Andress with KeyBanc Capital Market. Brett Andress : I wanted to go back to turkey real quick. Could you comment a little bit more on the bird performance this quarter? I mean did it come in worse than you were expecting and maybe what's happening now here in May and I guess how long do you think it would take you to get these issues corrected? James Sheehan : Thanks Brett. The turkey performance was about where we thought it would be and improved a little bit close to the end of the quarter so we're seeing some improvement in the performance. It's a slow process. And it takes time to determine what you need to do to improve the turkey performance, there's a bit of a learning curve here and I think that we think that we are getting close to turning the corner on us. Brett Andress : And last one on the driver of the grocery margin, I think it was close to a record for the second quarter. So I just want to understand some of the puts and takes, maybe how much was advertising, and maybe what were some of the largest input benefits or maybe some of the largest pressures because I think avocadoes are spiking reasonably and it seems like your expectations for beef and pork inputs are also up. So maybe you can kind of clarify \u2013 maybe some of the expectations going forward. James Sheehan : In the second quarter I mean clearly we saw strong growth from SPAM, Wholly, Herdez, Guacamole and SKIPPY which are great margining businesses for us. Clearly we've had the inclusion of our Justin's business which has been great acquisition and of course we've talked about our recent innovations like Skippy Phoebe Bites and Herdez, as Wholly Guacamole, Salsa and those are all accretive innovations to the grocery products group. In terms of advertising, I would tell you it's a small small portion that improvement. And then we did have some offsets. Well for the quarter show we had had a difficult quarter and a large part of that was just some promotional activity that that didn't play out the way that we thought. But remember I mean we're coming off a banner two thousand and sixteen for our Chile business so again we feel really good about where that is heading. And so for the back half of the year I mean we're thinking about GP as more of the same, so strong growth from SPAM, Wholly, AAM, Justin\u2019s continues to ramp up and then these are creative innovations are strong growth from stamp holy air to really good about portfolio to deliver long term stated goals for GP. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. Jeremy Scott : I just want to get a sense of the retail and foodservice landscape, and how that's changing given the impact of labor costs? Clearly we've seen the growth in the retail perimeter and on-site preparation of the past 10 years in grocery and what that had done to the center of the story lines but given that it's a much more labor intensive process it seems like the natural progression would be to outsource more of those perimeter goods for now in others and you could be the preferred providers, I would assume that that would translate the foodservice as well. What\u2019s the opportunity here, what are you hearing from your customers with this business, what does that mean for the sustainability of refrigerated foods margins? Jim Snee : Jeremy, that\u2019s a great question. I mean there certainly is a retail focus on that area of prepared food. It's not new focus, but I would tell you it feels like retailers are really starting to finally figure it out and sell for it and you're exactly right. I mean the business is more closely aligning with the traditional foodservice business. And that bodes really really well for us. I mean our ability to work with operators and so if you consider retail prepared foods and operator. Our ability to help them take out labor is second to none. I mean we're able to develop customized solutions to meet their needs in a variety of different ways that with ease of preparation taking out labor but still very very high quality products that consumers believe are prepared in the back of the house. So it is going to -- it's an area of focus for us because it's an area of focus for the retailers and sets up really well for how we run our foodservice business. Jeremy Scott : I guess in that same light, is a lot of regional specialty vendors that provide these goods to the retail perimeter. What\u2019s your take on \u2013 the M&A pipeline is consolidating maybe some of that opportunity. Jim Snee : I don't -- I mean I don't want to speculate on that. I mean as we think about it certainly we've got our own criteria. We're looking for number one, number two brands, opportunity to become more global, accretive margins. So we've got our own criteria when we think about how we're going to approach the M&A market. Operator : Next we have an additional question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Just a follow up on party trays, normally that shows up in your prepared comments as demonstrating growth in the quarter. I certainly saw a lot of growth in the Nielsen data but you didn't mention it today. Have you lost any distribution on party trays? Jim Snee : No Ken, or Rob I'm sorry. We actually -- party trays are doing well. I mean as you go across the entire meat products portfolio, we didn't get too specific with it but the growth in the IRI data was very strong across many many categories. So we just didn't list it there and party trays continued to do really well for us and we do all have only so much space in the press release but you're right, party trays are very important to our meat products business and continue to be doing really well. End of Q& A Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Sir, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well thank you all very much for your participation today. While we're proud of the results for many of our businesses we clearly understand that our mission is to deliver growth. Our team knows what needs to be done this year and is fighting to deliver our key results. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today and have an enjoyable long weekend. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets Benjamin Theurer - Barclays Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Heather Jones - Vertical Trading Group Akshay Jagdale - Jefferies Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Hormel Foods Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, August 24, 2017. I would like to turn the conference over to Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Annis. Nathan Annis : Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6 :30 AM Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at www.hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. On our call today is Jim Snee, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Sheehan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Jim Snee will provide a review each segment's performance for the quarter, a strategic review of the acquisitions of Fontanini and Ceratti and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2017. Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results for the quarter, a financial review of the acquisitions and further assumptions relating to our fiscal 2017 outlook. The line will be opened for questions following Jim Sheehan's remarks. As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to get back in the queue. An audio replay of this call will be available beginning at 11 :00 AM today Central Standard Time. The dial-in number is 800-263-0877and the access code is 9221656. It will also be posted to our website and archived for one year. Before we get started with the results of the quarter, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking, and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Among the factors that may affect the operating results of the company are fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and market conditions for finished products. Factors that may affect actual results of the acquisitions include, but are not limited to whether and when the company will be able to realize the expected financial results and accretive effective effectively the transactions and how customers, competitors, suppliers and employees will react to the transactions. Please refer to Pages 32 through 38 in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2017 for more details. It can be accessed on our website. Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors with a better understanding of the company's operating performance by excluding the sales and volume impact of the divestiture of the Diamond Crystal Brands business, the divestiture of the Farmer John business, and the acquisition of Justin's specialty nut butters. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as adjusted sales and volume. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced third quarter results of $0.34 per share, down 6% from last year. Sales for the quarter were down 4% on a 9% decrease in volume. Adjusted sales grew 1% while adjusted volume was down 1%. While the results are not where we expected them to be, there is a lot of good news to share. I will briefly touch on some positive news in our company and then address the areas that are challenged and what actions we are taking to address those challenges. From a financial perspective, we posted record pretax earnings for the quarter as our two largest segments, Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products more than offset declines in our three other segments. Adjusted net sales increased 1% even at Jennie-O Turkey store sales declined 9% or $35 million. We also made progress toward many of our strategic initiatives since the second quarter conference call. We committed $130 million in capital towards an expansion of one of our vacant facilities in Wichita, Kansas. We have experienced tremendous demand for bacon and this expansion will give us much-needed capacity for many of our premium precooked bacon items, most notably BACON 1. We expect this expansion to be completed in December 2018. We also announced two acquisitions of family-owned businesses. Last week we acquired Fontanini Italian Meats and Sausages. Since 1960, the Fontanini family has done a wonderful job growing their authentic, branded line of Italian meats and sausages items. Fontanini enhances our branded Hormel food service and Burke Pizza toppings businesses. This acquisition also gives us more production capacity and allows us to avoid major capital expenditures at our current facilities. We intend to integrate Fontanini into the refrigerated foods group over the next six to nine months. We do not plan to operate Fontanini as a standalone subsidiary, but instead integrate the plant into our Refrigerated Foods operations group and their sales force into our Hormel foodservice division. The integration will allow us to attain significant synergies. We also announced the acquisition of Ceratti, an authentic family-owned, branded meats business located in Brazil. This acquisition is a great strategic fit for Hormel Foods as their retail and foodservice daily meat business closely mirrors our domestic portfolio. Ceratti will operate as a standalone business in Brazil and will serve as a platform for future acquisitions in South America. Jim Sheehan will provide financial details related to the Fontanini and Ceratti acquisitions. As you will see, we once again maintained our financial discipline in the acquisition process. As I mentioned, there were challenges this quarter. We saw two of our primary raw materials pork bellies and beef trim reach all-time record high prices. Since late April, belly prices have more than doubled and are currently trading around $2 per pound. While we generate bellies internally through the hog harvest process, we also procure a large quantity of bellies externally. The speed and magnitude of these increases pressured both our retail and foodservice bacon business. We have implemented price increases with the majority being realized late in the fourth quarter. We also saw 50% beef trim prices hit record levels this quarter. While beef trim prices have recently decreased, they are still at elevated levels relative to last year. As a reminder, we procure all our beef needs externally for products in grocery products and international such as Hormel Chili, beef stew and products in refrigerated foods such as Hormel Pepperoni and dry sausage items. We have taken different pricing actions depending on the category, channel and competitive activity and expect the majority of pricing to be in effect late in the fourth quarter. Jim Sheehan will provide further details on the financial impact of commodity prices in his remarks. Now turning to Jennie-O Turkey store. As we anticipated and communicated in the second quarter call, Jennie-O Turkey store had another difficult quarter compared to last year with earnings down 20%. Sales were down 9% and volume was down 7% driven by the decision to reduce production levels. Similar to the first half, three main issues affected Jennie-O Turkey store's profitability this quarter, Low Turkey markets, elevated competition and increased expenses. First, the Turkey markets were relatively unchanged from last quarter. We continue to operate in markets where lower Turkey prices year-over-year are affecting both our commodity sales prices and our value-added pricing. Second, increased competitive activity from other Turkey suppliers and competing proteins such as beef continue to pressure results. 50% beef trim prices are up significantly compared to last year, but we have not seen this translate into meaningful increases in ground beef prices at retail. Third, we incurred higher operating expenses, primarily related to bird performance issues with both our conventional flocks and those raised without antibiotics. Our team continues to work to address this issue through changes in feed and other live production factors. Despite the market conditions and operating challenges, the Jennie-O Turkey store team grew lean ground Turkey sales by high single-digits and recent 13 weeks scanner data shows positive sales trends. On our second quarter call, we indicated specialty foods would see double-digit growth for the back half of the year and that is not materializing. Part of the delta between our expectations and actual results is the increase in commodity prices for our contract packaging business. Similar to our Grocery Product segments, it will take a few months for pricing to catch up with input costs. Beyond that, we are disappointed with the results from CytoSport. We experienced a sharp decline in Muscle Milk ready to drink protein beverages as investments in the brand did not drive the expected growth. We continue to see aggressive competitive activity especially in the convenience store channel. We are making numerous corrective actions including increased promotional sport. International had a difficult quarter as our China meat business continues to experience high pork prices. While hog prices have decreased in China, key raw materials such as bellies and hams have not decreased at the same pace. We also incurred startup costs for our Jiaxing facility and higher-than-expected closing expenses for our Shanghai facility. We are now producing product at the Jiaxing facility and expect our SPAM production line to be running later in the fourth quarter. Grocery Products had a strong quarter for sales. Brands such as Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, SKIPPY, SPAM and Dinty Moore Stew all contributed to the sales growth. Profits for many of our brands such as Wholly Guacamole, SPAM, Dinty Moore and Hormel Chili were adversely affected by higher input costs, which was offset by decreases in advertising expenses. Refrigerated Foods had an excellent quarter as segment profit increased 15% primarily driven by high demand for fresh pork and operational improvements. Demand for our branded value-added products in retail and foodservice remained very strong. Foodservice brands such as Hormel BACON 1, fully cooked bacon, Hormel Fire Braised meats and retail brands such as Hormel Pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice Lunchmeats contributed to the excellent results. Consistent with what we communicated on the second quarter conference call, we continue to make responsible reductions to advertising and marketing expenses. Advertising expense this quarter was $24 million compared to $53 million in 2016. As a reminder, we incurred double-digit increases to advertising spend over the last three years and current advertising is comparable to our fiscal 2015 spend on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net sales. To maintain our advertising and promotional spend efficiency, some advertising dollars have shifted to promotions in order to maintain our share of voice and store. We are committed to growing our brands through effective advertising, but are trimming advertising expenses while we work through commodity input costs increase. We will continue to evaluate our marketing strategy as conditions change. Looking towards the fourth quarter, we see continued earnings pressure from high raw material prices, which will not be fully offset by price increases until late in the quarter. We indicated in earlier calls we have decreased our live production at Jennie-O Turkey store by mid-single-digits in order to procure more Turkey meat externally. We have been anticipating a cutback in industry production and based on recent USDA reports, are finally seeing some positive signs. July pulp placements were down 5% following minor decreases in the prior months. Although cold storage stocks continue to rise, the rate of gain is slowly. While the industry is moving in the right direction, we need to see further signs of lower pulp placements and lower cold storage. As such, we would expect turkey prices for the fourth quarter to be unchanged from current prices. We expect the fourth quarter performance to be similar to the previous quarters this year. As I indicated earlier, Specialty Foods will not achieve double-digit earnings growth in the back half, primarily due to lower sales trends at CytoSport. We now expect flat earnings in the fourth quarter. For Refrigerated Foods, our outlook has moderated due to rising input costs. Grocery Products expects a solid quarter of sales and earnings growth even as they work to overcome higher commodity markets. Jim Sheehan will be discussing the market dynamics impacting these segments in his portion of the call. And we are tempering our outlook for the International segment as high raw material prices continue to impact results in China. Based on the underperformance in the third quarter, current market conditions and lower expectations for Specialty Foods and International, we are lowering our full-year earnings per share guidance to $1.54 to $1.58 from the low end of the $1.65 to $1.71 per share. We have faced difficult market conditions this year. Commodity markets have been challenging to forecast based on both the volatility of the markets and the velocity of the change. The lag between the input cost increases and when price changes are realized in the marketplace, has pressured margins in the short term. We know it is our responsibility to address these shifts and find ways to move the business forward. We have a plan and are executing that plan to realize our long-term goals. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and additional key drivers for the remainder of 2017. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Volume for the third quarter was \u00a31.1 billion, a 9% decrease compared to last year. Sales for the third quarter were $2.2 billion, a 4% decrease. Excluding Justin's and the sale of Diamond Crystal Brands and Farmer John, adjusted volume decreased 1% and adjusted sales increased 1%. We generated record earnings before income taxes of $278 million up 1% from last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 34.3% compared to 28.6% last year. During the third quarter of last year we experienced an unusually low tax rate, which was a result of international restructuring. Our income taxes were 22% higher this quarter compared to last year. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 33.25% and 33.75%. Net earnings for the third quarter were $183 million down 7% compared to last year. General corporate expenses were lower primarily due to the continued focus on strategic cost management. We expect general corporate expenses to be below last year for the fourth quarter. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $33 million unchanged from last year. We expect depreciation and amortization to be $125 million for 2017. Equity and earnings for the quarter was $4 million down 38% compared to last year. High avocado cost offset strong sales for MegaMex. Cash flow from operations was $250 million in the third quarter, up from $213 million last year. The increase was primarily related to decreases in working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $42 million compared to $66 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $190 million this year. Projects include the completion of our plant in China, the replacement of the whole bird plant in Melrose, the bacon expansion in Wichita and ongoing investments for food and employee safety. We paid our 356th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This completes our 89th year of consecutive dividends. We repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock spending $45 million in the quarter. $10 million shares remain from the current authorization. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises, based on our internal valuation. Operating margins were 12.7%, a 70-basis point increase compared to last year. Grocery products and Refrigerated Foods increased operating margins during the quarter. as Jim Snee discussed, input costs for the third quarter were much higher than the previous quarter and the third quarter of last year with the exception of Jennie-O. Belly prices sharply increased in the quarter. Bellies moved to record highs and remained at historically high levels. On average, belly prices were approximately 40% higher than last year. We expect belly prices to be well above last year as the industry continues to experience lower cold storage levels and high demand for bacon. On average 72% pork trim prices were 20% above last year. We expect trim markets to remain well above last year for the fourth quarter. Prices for 50% beef trim were 70% higher for the quarter compared to last year. We expect beef prices to remain higher than last year for the fourth quarter. As discussed at Investor Day, we purchased between $700 million and $900 million of meat annually. The 20% to 70% increase in purchased meat cost has significantly affected the expectations for the second half of the year. Hog prices in the quarter were similar to last year. We expect to see more short-term volatility in the hog markets for the remainder of the year and into next year. During the fourth quarter, hog prices are expected to be higher than last year, but below the five-year average. Year-to-date, export demand has been strong. The USDA forecast exports to be up 10% in 2017 and up another 4% in 2018. Domestic consumption also remains very strong. For example, pork feature activities has increased 120% in the last 13 weeks and pork pricing has materially increased since last quarter. Two new pork facilities are coming online in September. Based on the strong international and domestic demand trends and high commodity markets, we feel the industry is not at risk for a short-term overcapacity condition. We remain confident we're well positioned to utilize the internally generated commodities and purchase the externally sourced raw materials required to support our value-added products. Feed costs were lower compared to last year. We expect feed cost to trend in line with last year for the fourth quarter. Breast meat and other turkey commodity prices remained at seven-year lows. Based on inventory and production levels, we do not expect material changes in prices until we see a few more months of declines in turkey pulp placements. We're also looking at the cold storage levels as a leading indicator for turkey prices. Currently, cold storage levels for breast meat are 18% higher than last year. As Jim discussed, we acquired Fontanini last week. The purchase price was $425 million and includes the Fontanini brand, a large salesforce, a fully staffed production facility in the Chicago area and access to new customers. The transaction is structured as an asset deal and will provide an ongoing cash flow benefit as a result of tax amortization of the adjusted asset basis. The net present value of this cash flow benefit is estimated to be $90 million. Fontanini provides us much-needed capacity and also allows us to avoid a major planned capital expenditure in 2018 of $150 million. The transition of production to the Fontanini facility will provide operational synergies. Annual sales were approximately $240 million and are expected to grow 5%. Fontanini's operating margins are accretive to both refrigerated foods and the total company. We estimate that steel will be slightly dilutive in 2017 and between $0.03 to $0.04 per share accretive without synergies in 2018. With Fontanini producing and selling products similar to our existing foodservice business, we will have immediate synergies in supply chain operations, finance and sales. We also acquired the Ceratti brand, a value-added meat business in Brazil. The purchase price was $104 million. The acquisition comes with a sales and marketing team, fully staffed production facility and professional management team. Ceratti's annual sales were approximately $100 million and have been growing at mid-teen levels. We expect that trend to continue. We estimate that steel will be slightly diluted in 2017 and $0.01 per share accretive in 2018. Ceratti's margins are diluted to International's margins, but we expect to improve margins over time. Ceratti will not contain many synergies. One-time cost for the second half of the year for Fontanini, Ceratti and other acquisition efforts total $0.01 per share. These costs include deal costs and estimated inventory step-up costs. We plan to finance these transactions with a combination of cash on hand and funds from our short-term revolver. At this time, we'll turn the call over the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Maybe just at the outset Jim and Jim, help me think about the performance in the quarter and relative to the expectations you have on the May call and at the June Analyst Day, the bigger areas, the shortfall and as you think about the guidance cut, just maybe any way to parse the geography of where those cuts came from between raw materials and Refrigerated and Grocery and International and specialty and just how -- and the impact of the acquisitions in the short term and where things really fell short of your own internal projections two and three months ago? Jim Snee : Okay. Sounds good Adam. So, when you think about that guidance reduction, I guess the first thing I would tell you is think about the reductions being spread equally across all the segments and now that being said, there were a number of different factors in each of the statements. So, when you think about Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods, primary driver there impacted by the record prices for the key inputs and as we mentioned, prising really won't be in effect until late in Q4. From a jobs perspective, the recovery that we expected to see in Q4 does not appear to be materializing and from an International perspective, the raw material impact in China combined with the additional Shanghai closing costs and then they are taking a portion of the deal costs that Jim mentioned. And then, really from Specialty Foods, we talked about again the raw material increase in contract packaging and then the miss on CytoSport. The sales didn't materialize the way we had anticipated. So that's how you can think about them across the business segments. From a quarterly perspective, probably want to think about them about the majority of the reduction was in Q3. We do have pricing that takes hold in the back half of Q4. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful and then thinking about the implications into 2018, I appreciate that it's early still and certainly there is a lot of volatility in the near term, but as you starts to -- start penciling in pieces of 2018 can you talk about the confidence level on sustainability of Refrigerated margins, Jennie-O improvement, the accretion from the deals that you just alluded to, just the things that you're starting to get some line of sight to and where the thought is for next year? Jim Snee : Sure. We can do that for you Adam. I will open it by saying we're not giving guidance into 2018, but again as we go through the segments and you think about, clearly in Refrigerated Foods, we'll have the benefit of Fontanini, which is a great addition to our portfolio. We'll certainly be watching the changes in the hog markets and the volatility that could come. In Grocery Products, we know that will have our pricing in effect. Would tell you that we are also watching volumes as a result of that pricing and any changes we may need to make. But we're very optimistic about the Grocery Products portfolio. In terms of jobs, we expect to see some of these unfavorable market conditions still into 2018, but we at some point, jobs is going to get incrementally better. For Specialty Foods, we had a lot of moving parts over the last couple of years and we've got work to do, but we know that will get Muscle Milk back on track and then from an international perspective, we're pleased with the addition of the Ceratti brand in Brazil. We do believe that will have improvements in the China meat business and then of course the full benefit of having our new Jiaxing facility up and running, in country production of SPAM should have some really nice benefits there. So that's how we're starting to think about 2018 and some of the color around that. Adam Samuelson : I appreciate the color. Very helpful. I'll pass the line. Jim Snee : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to ask about the SG&A expense reduction during the quarter. If you can maybe provide more color in terms of the key drivers and how you're looking about the sustainability in the reduction that we saw? Jim Sheehan : Sure Rupesh. As we talked about at Investor Day, we're really focused on making strategic changes to our expense structure. We've been focused on supporting our critical initiatives, our long-term goals, but reducing expenses in other areas. So that has been the main focus of the group over the last six months. We did have an advertising reduction of $30 million in SG&A, but we're very pleased with the progress that we've seen around managing our expenses while supporting those long-term initiatives. Rupesh Parikh : And then as you look at the pullback in the advertising spending during the quarter and I guess you've been going forward, do you believe that at all impacted your topline performance and do you expect it to impact your topline going forward? Jim Sheehan : Rupesh, we don't. We are obviously strategically looking at our advertising spend and we are committed to the long-term growth and health of our brands. This level that we're at is our 2015 level, which is still a very healthy level after several years of double-digit increases and these are all prudent decreases. The other thing I would remind you of is that we are shifting some of the dollars to trade, so that we're maintaining our in-store share of voice and we're confident that we'll still be able to drive sales growth. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to understand a little bit about why it is taking this long to pass through these higher costs. You didn't mention bacon, I don't think in terms of what that pass-through looks like. Can you be a little more specific about it because it's a big part of what you do? Are you passing it through -- has it passed through already at retail because I know that's kind of quick? Is it taking longer in foodservice or not? And secondly, I didn't hear you mention retail bacon as being part of the things that went well in the quarter? Our Nielsen data would indicate that your sales are way up on retail bacon. Can you be more specific as to what's happening there just to give us a sense of comfort that to say the temporary phenomenon? Jim Sheehan : Absolutely Rob. So, I'll start with the pricing perspective and we've been very aggressive in the pricing action that we've taken across our entire portfolio and we frequently talk about from a retail perspective you're going to have a 45 to 60-day lag. And we have taken pricing on retail bacon, retail pepperoni and a whole slew of grocery products items. From a foodservice perspective, we certainly get the benefit of the price increase sooner on our street business, but we do have some contract business that can have a one to three-month lag. So, it really is a mixed bag, but I think the key take away here is that we have been very aggressive with all of our pricing action and we're priced to the peak of the market that we've seen. And as a reminder, because of that lag, that's why we're saying the pricing will take hold late in Q4. From a retail bacon performance, you're correct. We had an absolutely great quarter on volumes and sales, both in retail and foodservice. The challenge of course is that margins suffered due to the fast run up in belly prices and obviously it's a competitive category, but our focus has been growing our premium black label bacon line in retail. And of course, we've talked to you at Investor Day about the investments that we've made in BACON 1 and as I started off my comments, we're very excited about the strategic investment that we're making down in Wichita, Kansas in our Dold facility to support the high demand for foodservice BACON 1. So, pricing action, very aggressive, bacon performance very strong. Sets us up really well for the future. Robert Moskow : That's great. Thank you for the color. And if I could move you to the acquisition that -- the Fontanini acquisition, it sound like a big part of the logic was opportunity cost avoidance I guess or however you want to put. You didn't have to build this new plant. But you are kind of holding out a number for synergies that could also help us in fiscal '18, 5% of sales is a typical number in the group, maybe 7% of sales for synergies. When do you think you'll give us some insight as to what those synergies could be? Jim Snee : Rob, this is Jim Snee. I am going to start with the first part about this fit, so your comment about I guess I call it capital avoidance, that was part of the equation. It wasn't a majority part of the equation. From our perspective and I\u2019ve talked a lot about my desire to grow and accelerate our foodservice business. And so, this is a perfect addition to our foodservice business. It's branded, it's high margin business and it's a growing business. A direct sales organization, which in this day and age becomes less and less common. It mirrors the sales organization that we have and then we just see this as a great fit complementing our foodservice business. It also complements the Burke Organization and as I mentioned in my comments, we are up against some capacity constraints that we were going to have to spend some money and this gives us tremendous relief in that respect. Jim, I'll turn it over to you for the synergy portion. Jim Sheehan : Sure. And as you discussed, there was $150 million of capital avoidance, but also the $90 million of tax cash flow that really equates to $240 million of the $425 million that was spent. We obviously have looked at the synergies as we were doing our valuation. We feel that the synergies will be at or above -- at or slightly above what you would refer to as an average synergy, but that excludes the advantages that we have from both the capital avoidance and the benefit we have from the tax cash flow. We're working with the Fontanini team now to finalize the plans and we think that the synergies will be gained very quickly. Robert Moskow : Got you. Last question, you helped us shape a little bit fiscal '18 by segment Jim Snee. Are any of these segments do you look at vulnerable to declines in fiscal '18? It is one particular segment that might be more vulnerable than others? I think the message was kind of like well, they could be flattish maybe with a little bit of upside I thought, but we've seen some unusual things happen across your business. So, I just want to know if there's one segment that appears more -- there is more that could go wrong I guess? Jim Snee : Sure. Rob again I am going to qualify it by saying, I am not giving guidance into 2018, but we're clearly watching what's happening in the hog market in Refrigerated Foods and the volatility associated with that. As Jim mentioned, Jim Sheehan mentioned, we know that there's additional capacity coming online and we're watching the three factors that we've talked about in the past; international demand, domestic demand and the corresponding capacity and where we sit right now after coming through the quarter, where four of our top seven inputs experience record prices because there was an adequate supply. That additional capacity is certainly needed in the short term. So, these are unprecedented changes in the hog industry. We're watching them closely and so I think the answer to your question, we're watching Refrigerated as we head into 2018. Robert Moskow : If I could, if there is more capacity coming online and international demand is really, really strong, is there enough hogs out there to meet it all? Like is there -- are you saying there is a risk that hog futures might spike. Jim Sheehan : The interesting thing that has happened through the cycle is that hog costs have been very flat to last year. So, it looks like there is really a balance in the hog supply and the demand right now. The other thing that we think is important to understand is that the groups that are bringing these processing plants online are in fact hog producers. So, we certainly feel that they believe that there is adequate hog supplies to fill their plants. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Farha Aslam with Stephens. Farha Aslam : Hi. Good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning, Farha. Farha Aslam : It sounds like some of the disconnect between commodities and your margins is really on visibility. Could you share with us how you establish visibility into your commodity markets and what are you pricing policies overall on pricing? Jim Snee : So Farha, I guess our approach to pricing, we are looking at commodity markets on a very regular basis. We certainly have forecast in place at the beginning of the year. We look at those throughout the year. That helps us not only set the pricing at the beginning of the year, but what we think it might look like through the course of the year. From our perspective, the big disconnected in all of this is that we simply can't forecast record prices. We've taken the price action just as quickly as we could. We've priced these items to the peak of the market that we've seen and I would say, while the record high prices would be the disconnect, the connect would be that we have a proven ability to price in many market conditions and it's really that short term volatility that hurts us the most. Jim Sheehan : As we gave guidance into the back half of the year, We predicted the trends, as Jim said, we didn't predict that they would hit record highs that we did not predict the velocity at which they would change. So, we saw the trends coming. We didn't see the magnitude and the speed in which we're seeing in the volatility of the markets at this level. Farha Aslam : So as commodities moderate, because it looks like belly prices are starting to moderate, avocados should start to come down. Do you expect your margins to expand as you have pricing in place? Jim Sheehan : Yeah certainly, that's why we're saying with the pricing taking hold in the back half of Q4 and then as I referenced, as I gave some color into our 2018 outlook, you're going to have grocery products that will benefit from the pricing that's in effect? Farha Aslam : So that will be a positive for '18. That's helpful and then going into your Brazil acquisition, this is your first entry down in South America, it's rather small in scale. Do you have the distribution you need in the Brazilian market to get your products into retail and how quickly do you anticipate building scales down in South America? Jim Sheehan : Sure. Well first Farha, now you have to believe me when I say the pipeline was full all those quarters right, we finally got a couple across the finish line. But yeah, you're correct. Ceratti is our first entry into South America. They're premium branded items and it's a niche portfolio that we know very well. This is an established business and so they have distribution in the marketplace. They have a professional management team. It's an 85-year-old organization. So, as we look at it, yes from a $100 million perspective, you could say it's a small acquisition. We look at it to say this is our first entry point into South America and we see this as a platform for future acquisitions in South America. Clearly there are some learnings that we need to obtain along the way and this is a tremendous vehicle, a successful vehicle for us to be able to achieve those. Farha Aslam : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Ken Zaslow : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : I'm going to go at this a little differently. I get the commodity issues. I get the input cost, the pricing all that, but what I am not fully understanding is I get the sense that there is increasing execution issues and let me just kind of -- and that something I guess is more my surprise than anything else. You got Applegate, you have CytoSport, you got China, help me understand how you're addressing the execution issue and why they have arisen and that's my first question and then I'll ask my follow-up. Jim Snee : Sure. The way you described it Ken, probably the one that I would agree with you on is the CytoSport piece. We did give expectations of double-digit growth and to be fully transparent, we missed that one. We're making some investments, got aggressive competition in that ready to drink C-store space and the results did not materialize the way we had anticipated. So, I would agree with you on that. When you talk about Applegate, not much has changed from the last time we talked about it, but as part of Refrigerated Foods, clearly, clearly the driver was record prices for key inputs and so had we not experienced those record prices, especially in Refrigerated Foods we would've been fine in that space. So, I certainly understand your commentary, but would say that the specialty area is the one where I can agree with you on. Ken Zaslow : What about the China issue because in Shanghai you closed the facility. There is increasing cost relative to expectations. Again, I am not trying -- you go through a management change obviously at the senior level. There is a couple times that you've missed consensus -- expectation and again I get the belly prices, all the prices we all get. But I feel like there is around the perimeter there seems to be more execution issues than I am used to over the last decade or so and I just didn't know if that's what you guys are seeing or it's just being exacerbated by the commodity outlook? Jim Snee : I think that last part is right on Ken. I think given the exacerbation of the commodity markets combined with what's happening at jobs with historic issues there as well, the one part on the China piece was we're starting up a significant plant and yeah, we certainly had plan to have the Shanghai plant closed and items transitioned and it took us a little longer in terms of quarters not years. And so, the cost spilled over and I appreciate your comment that the senior management team, but this is the same team that's been in place at very senior levels of our organization for the last five or 10 years and so I do think it is -- it's a situation that's exacerbated by the current market conditions and hopefully that helps with some color. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then my second question is the outlook for 2018, help me out a little bit, is it an earnings growth story or is it a rebasing of your earnings power and there is a big distinction between the two because now you're obviously taking your base down pretty considerably. So is there a makeup in 2018 or you're just going to grow your five, ten that algorithm and again I'm looking for exact guidance, but I think there is a big difference between those two. Jim Snee : Again, I agree with you Ken, there is a difference between the two and we're not in position at this point to give additional guidance. I gave obviously the color that hopefully is helpful. I guess some additional color around the fire and 10 which is repetitive to what we've discussed. But clearly, we believe it's an all-in number, the 2% to 3% of organic topline growth that we've seen over the last several years, very achievable. Clearly, we need to leverage our balance sheet for accretive acquisitions for the other part of that five and 10. We've demonstrated our ability to do that here recently. Jim talked about some of the strategic cost management, operational efficiencies, clearly gross margin improvements will help us get to that 10% bottom line and I do think of going back to some of our earlier conversations around these commodity markets, we've got a proven ability to price in these many market conditions and it's really that short term volatility. So, I can't give you specific guidance, but hopefully the 2018 outlook color reminder on the five and 10 being a longer term all in number is helpful. Ken Zaslow : So, the five and 10 is a long-term number that means that if you were under, you need to overachieve in some other distant year, is that fair? Jim Snee : That's fair. Over time, you're current. Ken Zaslow : All right. Thank you. Jim Snee : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Mr. Theurer. Your line is open. You may want to de-press your mute function. Benjamin Theurer : Hello. Can you hear me? Jim Snee : Yes, we can. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Kind of weird. Didn't work out. Sorry for that. I wanted to ask a question in regards to the Fontanini acquisition you've mentioned. So, I clearly get it that the CapEx benefit you have going forward, could you share a little bit more detail on the current profitability and what you think that business should be running up from an operating profit margin point of view? Is a similar as what you're having in the two categories or is it a little lower and you believe that through the synergies you can get it to the same level? Thanks for sharing the sales number, but would be good to get also a little bit detail on operating more EBITDA level if you can share that, that would be much appreciated and I have one other follow-up question. Jim Snee : Sure Benjamin. I guess the best answer I can give you on Fontanini is that the margins for the business are accretive to both Refrigerated Foods and the total company which is -- which obviously is a very good thing and just a reminder in our comments, we talked about it the $0.03 or $0.04 impact going forward. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. And on the Brazilian acquisition, just to stick with the M&A business, so you've mentioned this is going to be basically a separated unit that's going to be completely separated run. Is that kind of business that you opportunistically purchase? Clearly the price is a little lower as having like a foot in the country to potentially where you expand into future and if it's not working out, it's not that much of a cost associated, but how do we have to think about that tiny step into Brail which tends to likely be profiting and growing country and in coming years after two years of very tough economic environment. So that's to understand a little bit more of the strategic part behind that. Jim Snee : Sure. So, this is a very strategic acquisition for us. It is not opportunistic. It provides a great opportunity for us, but it is very, very strategic. We've been working at acquiring this family-owned business for some time and those do take a little longer to get across the finish line. We see this as a platform for future growth in Brazil. We continue to look for opportunities -- already looking for opportunities to expand. We've got a great professional management team that comes along with the Ceratti acquisition and it's a $100 million business but it's a very healthy $100 million business that's growing and will serve as a great platform for the future. Jim Sheehan : One thing worth mentioning is that as we went into Brazil, we spent a great deal of time on due diligence and the deal also, the valuation of the deal will include a discount based on the country risk. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. That's much appreciated comment. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. Jeremy Scott : Good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning. Jeremy Scott : So, the Refrigerated Foods margins, they came in actually nicely above where we were modeling and I was hoping if you could help break down some of the elements of the 230 Bps expansion year-on-year. The reason why I ask is, we were relatively clean comparison on core commodity margins outside of the trim pricing. So, anything you can put a number on would be very helpful as we look to build out '18 and '19 and maybe starting with Farmer John. We've been modeling it is a 40 Bps to 50 Bps ongoing tailwind, but it was something little bit more in the quarter and then if there is a greater mix shift to Applegate, your value-add component, what will Fontanini build in '18, maybe just kind of help out with your core the 230 Bps you can break that down by peace would be very helpful. Jim Snee : Okay. Jeremy, I think your assessment of Farmer John, there's I think dramatically difference there. Clearly the big driver for Refrigerated Foods is the improvements, the increases in the value-added sales and as we think about what's happened there, we've seen really a great performance in the quarter both in our meat products, which is our retail division across a number of different brands. The foodservice business continues to outperform the industry and when we talk about the increases with BACON 1 and their portfolio, certainly those margins are accretive to the overall Refrigerated Foods organization. So, it's the increase in value added, some of the mix shift even within the value-added and so again we remain very positive about the great work we're seeing in our Refrigerated Foods segment. Jeremy Scott : Okay. And then maybe just keep -- talk a little about what was the core reason for the Muscle Milk softness? Is it strictly competitive issues or were there something else going on in the quarter whether the channel shift or maybe break that down a little bit for us? Jim Snee : Sure. So, we talked about the channel and certainly it was primarily in ready to drink in the C-store and a year ago, would have been late summer, we had a voluntary recall on our ready to drink items and as we progressed at the end of 2016 and 2017, it's clear to us that we underestimated the impact of that voluntary recall. So, we had some pipeline full fill, certainly some favorable comps that gave us a positive feeling about the business. What we've see most recently is some of the aggressive competition in the ready to drink C-store space, really exposed the business hadn\u2019t materialized the way we thought. The bigger thing for us is now what are the actions that we're going to take in terms of giving that business additional promotional support, working very aggressively with our distribution partner to gain back any lost distribution and making sure that we're priced appropriately in key channels. So, a number of different things there and we've got work to do as we head into 2018 with that brand. Jeremy Scott : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Heather Jones : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick questions, you mentioned I thought I caught a comment about pricing for the peak of these commodity input pressures and so like we've seen belly prices come down about 25%, pork trim is down about a third from its recent peak. So, as we're thinking about the pricing actions and that you've taken, did you price assuming that bellies are going to go back to that $2 plus range and trim, how should we think about the magnitude of price? Jim Snee : I think the key take away is we didn't think it was going to go up as fast as it did and so we didn't have a preconceived notion that it was going to moderate either. So, we priced it to the peak of the market. We know that obviously we work through some inventory, which takes longer in GP, our Grocery Products division than it does in some of the other divisions. So that is the way that we thought about pricing is that we are priced to the peak of the market. Heather Jones : Okay. And on the Turkey side, your volume declines, how much of that is purposeful declines to try to do your part to rightsize supply and demand and how much is related to the production issues that I don't know if you mentioned on this call, but I remember you mentioned on the Q2 call. So just how we can think about purposeful versus just an effect of health issues or whatever? Jim Sheehan : Yeah, I think from a business volume perspective, it was all purposeful, very intentional and that you can model that about a 7% decline. Heather Jones : Okay. Thank you so much. Jim Sheehan : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to talk through the Refrigerated Foods outlook and obviously you've been -- I've listened to everything you've said. We appreciate the color. I know it's hard to predict what's going to happen in an event like this, but even if the volume is there right, so if the demand is there for the plants to run, why wouldn't the profitability be lower? So that's my question is would the processors are operating at three, four times normal profitability, so one would venture to say that okay, the demand there, they're going to operate the plants, but there's no way they're going to operate those plants at these profitability levels right. It is inherent in your expectations that the cut-out margin will normalize, that's my main question really is. I get that the hogs that will come to market will get sorted and there is significant supply out there, but we're really talking about what's going to happen with the cut-out margin and how it will impact your numbers? So is your expectation that cut-out margins will remain well above normal levels like they are now and then go ahead\u2026 Jim Sheehan : Well, as we discussed, what we focus on our hog cost, that our input cost primarily around bellies and 72% trim, we think the hogs will be slightly higher in the fourth quarter and even going into 2017. Bellies remain well above last year as freezer inventories are low and demand for bacon is very high. 72% trim is we expect to be above last year. What we have seen again is this what seems to be very much a balance in the hog supply and demand that isn't driving up the cost of the hogs. What we said before is the additional capacity is a benefit to us and we continue to watch the international domestic demand and the additional capacity coming online. Based on our analysis, we believe that the additional capacity is needed. Akshay Jagdale : Right. So, net, net you think that next year is a more or less favorable operating environment for Refrigerated Foods compared to what you've seen last couple of years? Jim Sheehan : Well, we have the addition of Fontanini. We should be through the changes in the hog supply should be clear as the additional plants become online. Hopefully there's additional supply of the raw materials, so that there is not the type of volatility and spikes that we've seen in the bellies and the 72% trim. Markets, bellies or beef excuse me, has been very hard to predict. So, I think the color that Jim gave you would be -- is what we feel about the Refrigerated Foods outlook for 2018. Akshay Jagdale : Okay. And just to summarize everything you've talked about in terms of commodity prices. So, the best way to think about it is I guess that you've seen a significant rise, I think you have given some numbers around how much you buy in the open market. But essentially the fourth quarter died down if I may is all related to the lag or significantly related to the lag between the commodity costs and the price pass through and that next year that will normalize, so you'll literally get that back right. It's not like you're just absorbing that. It's a timing issue and you get that margin back next year, but it's like a quarter and a half lag. Jim Sheehan : Akshay, what I will tell you about Refrigerated Foods is historically and the way the business is structured, we do suffer on a short-term basis when we see spikes in commodity prices. It compresses our margins. The velocity that occurred in this cycle, certainly added to that difficulty. But as prices decline, historically we expand our operating margins in Refrigerated Foods. We hate to say the cycle is a good thing, but in the long term, it would tell you that we will expand our operating margins as prices decline. Akshay Jagdale : Perfect. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Snee for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you all very much for participating in our call this morning. There's no doubt this year has been challenging for us and I'm confident we are making the right long-term decisions to drive growth for our company while maintaining focus on delivering our key financial results. Our team is working as hard as ever to continue our long-term growth story. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you for joining us today. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release located on our corporate website. Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic net sales and organic volume. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to announce our full year and fourth quarter results. For the year three of our five segments Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods and International, delivered record earnings in spite of one last week than 2016. These three segments also delivered exceptionally strong organic sales growth. The growth in these segments offset declines at Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods, allowing the total company to achieve organic volume and sales growth in 2017. In spite of a volatile commodity market environment, we delivered a quarter of strong organic volume and sales growth. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.41 in line with our most recent guidance. The fourth quarter was marked by many bright spots, Grocery Products delivered excellent earnings growth, our Grocery Products team continues to do an outstanding job growing iconic brands in the center store such as SPAM and Dinty Moore, while simultaneously capitalizing on pockets of growth and dynamic on trend categories with brands like Wholly Guacamole and Herdez. SPAM was a strong contributor to international sales growth in addition to the inclusion of the Ceratti business for our international team. Our China business experienced strong sales and earnings from SKIPPY peanut butter and our branded meat products. The new Jiaxing client is producing and shipping products while the Shanghai facility has stopped production. Our current manufacturing operations in China now include Beijing, Jiaxing and our SKIPPY plant in Weifang.  Refrigerated Foods delivered results in line with our expectations. Organic sales growth was driven by food service sales of Hormel BACON 1, fully cooked bacon and Hormel Pepperoni. In addition to retail sales of BLACK LABEL bacon, NATURAL CHOICE products and CURE 01hams. Earnings in Refrigerated Foods were down due to the divestiture of Farmer John and favorable markets last year. The story of Jenny-O Turkey Store is very similar to what we communicated to you on the third quarter call. The Turkey market continues to be in an oversupply situation. Lower whole bird and commodity pricing was the key driver to lower sales and earnings this quarter. In spite of these difficult market conditions, Jennie-O Lean Ground Turkey continues to show growth and take share from ground beef. The results from specialty products are disappointing and driven by lower sales of Muscle Milk ready-to-drink protein beverages in the convenience store channel. The new leadership team at CytoSport is making the necessary adjustments to gain back ground from the setback they had this year. One key theme from this year is the impact record input prices had on our business. For some markets such as bellies and beef trim prices increased rapidly, but also decreased rapidly. Other markets such as Turkey breast dropped further and faster than anticipated and remain at depressed levels. Our sales and marketing teams continue to be diligent in their assessments and response to the cost volatility while finding ways to mitigate it. Overall, this year has been challenging and did not meet the expectations we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. However, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the intentional balance that we create in all areas of our business. Even with the disappointing year we had in the specialty foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, we still delivered record operating margin, record operating cash flow, returned a record amount of cash back to shareholders and increased our cash balance. Looking to 2018 we will continue to follow our path forward that I laid out at our Investor Day in June. First, we\u2019ll continue to evolve to a broader food company. The Columbus acquisition broadens our portfolio as we expand into a total deli provider and enhance our position in this advantage growth space. Second, expand and accelerate food service with the acquisition of Fontanini we will continue to aggressively grow our competitively advantage food service business. Third, become a more global food company. We are excited for the Ceratti acquisition in Brazil and our new plant in China. Both strategic investments will allow international to deliver above average growth this year. Fourth, reduce volatility and increase balance. We continue to increase the sales of value added products as a percentage of our total sales and we've complemented that growth with the acquisitions of purely value added businesses such as Fontanini, Ceratti and Columbus. Fifth, divest non-strategic assets. We will continue to take a hard look at all underperforming assets and if necessary make the difficult decisions required to ensure we are delivering shareholder value. And finally, modernizing our supply chain. Today we announced a reorganization of our supply chain. Glenn Leitch, who led Jennie-O Turkey Store to outstanding growth for the past seven years will now become Executive Vice President of Supply Chain. Glenn will be responsible for the entire supply chain from procurement to shipment. I would refer you to the separate press release for all the other details related to the reorganization. Overall, headwinds to our outlook in two 2018 include volatile commodity markets, a slower than expected recovery in the turkey industry and uncertainty in the hog and pork markets. The tailwinds in our business are clear. In addition to the solid fundamentals that will provide stronger organic growth, we have three new strategic acquisitions, numerous strategic investments and value added capacity and an innovation pipeline full of exciting new products. Our focus on innovation has never been stronger as evidenced by the substantial progress we made towards our 15% innovation by 2020 goal. As of the end of 2017, 14% of our total company sales came from products innovated in the last five years. Key products contributing to this growth include BACON 1, SKIPPY\u00aePB BITES and HERDEZ guacamole salsa. Our current pipeline of new products is deep and our innovation teams are thinking of new and interesting ways to get products to the market faster, with more scale and in a more cost efficient manner. The headline for 2018 will read strong value-added growth and strategic acquisitions more than offset commodity headwinds. Looking at the segments for 2018, we expect Jennie-O Turkey Store to continue to navigate difficult industry conditions, while the remaining segments will provide earnings growth. We expect modest earnings declines for the full year at Jennie-O Turkey Store. Earnings decreases in the first half will not be fully offset by increases in the back half as turkey market moves towards a slow recovery. We expect continued value added sales and volume growth led by Lean Ground Turkey, Oven Ready products and Turkey Burgers. We plan to be back on air with the Make The Switch media campaign in 2018. Despite the disparity of views in the hog industry, the fundamentals of refrigerated food have never been better. While we anticipate a reduction in the commodity profits and refrigerated foods we expect continued growth in our value added businesses to more than offset the declines. Again this year, we expect the Hormel food service team to deliver industry leading results and the addition of Fontanini has put them in a great position to continue that trend. We also expect a solid year of growth from meat products. Once finalized, the acquisition of Columbus will help Refrigerated Foods deliver earnings growth in 2018. This morning we also announced a union of the grocery products and specialty foods segments. Both organizations sell shelf-stable products, have a focus on the food, drug, mass and club channels; and are charged with managing CPG brands. Luis Marconi who currently leads Grocery Products will continue to lead this segment. Combined this segment will be a model for how to manage iconic brands such as SPAM and SKIPPY while nurturing the growth of fast growing franchises like Wholly Guacamole, Justin's and CytoSport. Over time, consolidating these two segments will deliver revenue and cost synergies in all aspects of the business, while continuing to deliver industry leading growth. For 2018 specifically, we expect sales and earnings growth to be driven by our MegaMex line of products, Skippy and Justin's nut butters, as well as improvement in our CytoSport business. International will have a strong year benefiting from the acquisition of Ceratti in addition to strong results from our China business. After taking into account all these factors we are setting our fiscal 2018 sales guidance at $9.4 billion to $9.8 billion and our earnings per share guidance at a $1.60 to a $1.70 per share. This guidance excludes the Columbus acquisition. Consistent with the acquisition announcement, we expect Columbus to be $0.02 to $0.03 accretive to earnings in 2018. I'm excited to close the Columbus acquisition and start the consolidation of our deli businesses. We expect to close the deal in December. Our first quarter comparison will be a difficult one as we annualized this divestiture of the Farmer John business and continue to manage through the oversupply in the turkey industry. Our planned show sales and earnings growth weighted towards the second half of the year aided by acquisitions, innovation and cost reductions and improvements in the turkey market. At this time I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for 2018. Jim Sheehan : Thank you Jim. Good morning everyone. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, a 10% decrease, compared to last year. Organic volume increased 2%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $2.5 billion a 5% decrease. Organic net sales increased 5%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $218 million, down 11% compared to last year. General corporate expenses were lower due to the focus on strategic cost management and lower employee related expenses. Advertising expense was $30 million compared to $55 million in 2016. We plan to increase advertising by 20% in 2018. Excluding advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses were 6.6% of sales, compared to 7.2% of sales last year. Deal cost associated with the Ceratti and Fontanini acquisitions were approximately $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter. Operating margins were 13.2%, a 70 basis point decrease, compared to last year. For the full year, operating margins were 14%, 10 basis points higher than 2016. We are maintaining our goal to be in the top quartile of our peer group in operating margins by 2020. Today the top quartile trial range is 16% to 20%. We plan to attain this goal through a focus on strategic cost management, acquisitions, innovation and by investing capital into high margin products such as BACON 1 and SPAM production in China. Our effective tax rate was 33.8%, compared to 33.1% last year. In 2018 we are expecting our full year tax rate to be between 32.3% and 33.3%. Starting in the first quarter, we will adopt the new accounting standards related to stock compensation. This is expected to benefit our effective tax rate in 2018 by approximately 100 basis points and increase earnings per share by approximately $0.02. The adoption of the standard will increase quarterly tax rate volatility. We generated record cash flow from operations of $499 million, up 34% from $371 million last year. The increase was primarily related to decreases in working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $103 million, compared to $90 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $425 million in 2018. The higher level of capital is driven by the investment into additional capacity for high-margin products and projects to improve manufacturing efficiencies. They include the expansion of baking capacity, modernization of the Austin plant and replacement of the Melrose plant. We paid our 357th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, at an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This morning we also announced a 10% increase to our dividend. The effective annual rate will be $0.75 per share. This is our 52nd consecutive year we have increased the dividend and the 9th consecutive year we have increased the dividend by a double digit rate. We repaid the debt associated with the Fontanini and Ceratti acquisition ending the year with $250 million in long-term debt, unchanged from 2016. After the Columbus transaction closes we expect our total debt to be approximately $1 billion. We remain in a strong financial position to fund any other capital needs. We did not repurchase stock in this quarter. We will continue to repurchase stock to set dilution from option exercises based on our internal evaluation of the stock. Input cost for the quarter were generally higher with the exception of the turkey markets. Hog prices in the fourth quarter were a 11% higher than last year. Prices last year reach multi-year lows. As Jim mentioned, there are conflicting viewpoints on the hog and pork industry. Hog price forecasts for calendar 2018 vary from high-single-digit decreases to mid-single-digit increases. Our expectation is for a low-single-digit increase in calendar year 2018. We expect earnings pressure in Refrigerated Foods during the first quarter due to the high cost compared to the unusually low cost last year. We continue to focus on three factors, domestic demand, export demand and industry capacity utilization. With the consumer trends moving towards increased protein consumption domestic demand remains very strong. The USDA cut out was 5% higher than last year for the fourth quarter. Export demand continues to be strong the USDA forecast for exports to be up 7% in 2017 and up another 6% in 2018. Hog supplies are expected to increase 3% to 4% next year. We continue to believe hog supplies are well-matched to industry capacity over the long-term. However, we do expect short term volatility depended on the progress of the new plants ramping it up to full production. We continue to assess the industry conditions and will make the necessary changes to ensure we are sourcing pork for our value added products at the lowest possible cost. In 2017 our commodity profits were slightly above average based on our market assumptions we expect commodity profits to be moderately below average in 2018. In 2018 we intend to reduce our hog harvest capacity by approximately 4%. If market conditions change we have the flexibility to adjust harvest levels. Belly prices remain volatile. Markets declined in the fourth quarter, but we're 25% higher than last year. We expect belly prices to remain volatile and in line with 2017. 72% pork trim prices were 15% above last year, we expect trim markets to be flat to 2017. 50% trim was 25% higher for the quarter. We expect beef prices to be flat to 2017 but higher in the first quarter. Beef costs we're lower compared to last year, we expect beef cost to be flat to last year. Turkey commodity prices remain at seven-year lows. Breast meat prices were 28% below last year. We have not seen the reduction to pull placements required to alleviate the oversupply condition. Cold storage remains that elevated levels. Turkey breast inventories are 17% above last year, while whole birds were 23% above last year. Based on the lack of meaningful production declines at high levels of inventory, we do not expect material changes in markets until the back half of the year. Our expectation is Jennie-O first half profits will be below 2017. We have made good initial progress on the financial strategy I laid out at Investor Day. These include reducing our general corporate expenses, improving our cash cycle and leveraging our balance sheet for growth. At this time I'll turn the call over to the operator for the portion of the call. Farha Aslam : Hi good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning Farha. Farha Aslam : Can you talk about Glenn Leitch's new role at the company? And how you look at your production facilities right now? And in particular, how you expect the Chinese plant to benefit earnings for next year? Jim Snee : Sure. So let's start with the new supply chain organization. What this is going to do for us is it's really going to give us better alignment across our entire organization. Today we have our operations that exist in our business units. And I would say that they're probably a bit fragmented. They're very successful but a bit fragmented, which really it inherently allows for duplications and inefficiencies. And so we believe that having this alignment across the organization and getting the structure and process right will allow us to become more cost effective, enhance our speed to market and really make us more agile over time, as we've \u2013 we're facing ever-changing, very dynamic market conditions. S I mean we believe this is a great move for our organization, it's consistent, very thoughtful with how we've been talking about our business and the needs to do this. In regards to China the new facility is going to help us in a couple of ways. And we were at capacity on a number of different lines because of the successful business we have in the food service segment. The other part that is going to do when it's more of a slower build is for the first time ever, we have in-country production of SPAM. And so when now that line is up and running, we've already seen some nice early success and are rapidly regaining distribution because we have been in-market with that product before. But really feel like not only operationally but structurally, we are set of for long-term success in China. Farha Aslam : That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, you highlighted variable commodity markets in 2018. Could you talk about Hormel's ability and experience to price for those fluctuations? And how retailers and consumers are accepting those prices? Jim Snee : Sure. I think we've demonstrated a track record of success when it comes to dealing with price increases. And a lot of that has to do with the brand positioning, delivering on the brand promise, but then also being a brand leader. And so given the strong brand presence that we have across our organization with so many number one and number two brands, we are able to successfully get those through. I would not say that it's easy, I mean, we take all price increases very seriously, and we work with all of our retail customers to make sure that we have got the best outcome for both of us. The other thing I would say, Farhat, is clearly, we understand the data and the insights around price elasticity and built that into our modeling as well. So I feel like we're pretty sophisticated and successful in that area. Farha Aslam : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes thanks. Good morning everyone. Jim Snee : Hi Adam. Adam Samuelson : So I guess maybe some clarifying questions on the guidance where you laid out 160, 170 range. From the Fontanini and Ceratti deals there\u2019s $0.04 to $0.05 of accretion. Do you think in the prepared remarks you alluded to a $0.05 tailwind on tax from the accounting change. And in the International segment, you should have the new plant up and running. And in fiscal 2017 you are absorbing cost as that started up and had some construction delays. And I guess, maybe there's a bit high accrual for incentive comp in the 2018 outlook, but I guess, if I put those kind of discrete factors to the side, I'm at the middle to upper end of your range on an organic basis for profit. And so is that the right characterization that the sum of grocery, refrigerated, Jennie-O and specialty profits are kind of in the middle to upper part of your range, flat net, am I doing that math right? Jim Snee : Yes, Adam you are. I mean, I think, if we go back to the headline I described in my comments is that the growth in our value-added business is going to offset some of the commodity volatility that we expect. And so if you go around really the business units, and I'll, \u2013 I mean, we have merged Grocery Products and specialty together, but just to help you with some clarity in that area, I mean, Grocery Products is going to be in line with the growth expectations that we have for that business. And quite frankly, specialty will have the same growth algorithm that we've talked about at CytoSport. We expect a return to growth in CytoSport. Refrigerated Foods is going to have low-single-digit growth in both sales and earnings. And International, you have assessed properly with strong double-digit growth and then John's will have low-single digit sales growth but really down mid-single digit from an earnings perspective because of the market conditions. So I think your rollup is fairly accurate getting to that range. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then so maybe putting some finer point on refrigerated and Jennie-O, is there any way to maybe dimensionalize kind of the range of outcomes as you think of the key variables as you sit here today, is it for Parker margins for refrigerated, is it belly price volatility? And then in Jennie-O, kind of some of the supply factors that you would be looking at to make for a better, stronger, I presume, second half is probably the bigger I'd note at this plant. Jim Sheehan : Certainly. Good morning Adam, this is Jim Sheehan. I\u2019ll talk a talk about some of the variables. The first thing is that there are very differing views about what's going to happen in the pork industry. Hog prices \u2013 forecast for hog prices are everything from down high single digits to up mid-single digits. We think we have taken a realistic view and we've identified our model on low single digits for the outlook. Now what is involved in that is that we're going to \u2013 we expect to see some volatility. Volatility as these playups ramp. Now in the first quarter, the cost of hogs were at $57 so far. I think it's important to understand that the five-year average in the first quarter is $75. And if you exclude the impact of the PEDV, those costs were at $70. So they're still below historical levels. But we had unseasonably low hog cost in the first quarter of 2007 \u2013 part of 2016, excuse me. And so we expect that we will be up against that as we go into 2018. So we have an unfavorable comparison for the first quarter of 2018. On the turkey side, I think, we\u2019ve tried to be clear on what we're watching. We're watching the poult placements and we're watching the inventory reports. So far, we're just not seen anything that would tell us that this \u2013 it's bottomed out yet. We believe that we're going to see market improvements in the back half of the year with some flattening of the conditions midyear, but really not much improvement until the end of the year. So depending on how those commodities work, we're trying to be very, very clear as to how we built our outlook and that should give you some insight as to what could change. Jim Snee : And Adam, I would add on, clearly, I mean, a lot of the industry, the turkey industry, is operating near breakeven. I mean, clearly, we are well above that range. We feel like we've done what we need to do and that we've cut production, and believe that the rest of the industry needs to do that as well. Quite frankly, we are a bit disappointed that we haven't seen that as of yet. So that\u2019s on the commodity side of the business but we still feel very confident as I talked about our number of different items that we expect to grow, the value-added items that will grow, our Lean Ground Turkey business is very healthy, I'm showing good growth and then still taking share versus the beef market. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s all. Very helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Jim Snee : Good morning. Rupesh Parikh : So I wanted to touch on the competitive environment. I was curious what you guys are seeing right now from a private label perspective and also what you're seeing from some of the other brand players. Jim Snee : From a private label perspective, our belief is that it's pretty standard operating procedure. I mean, private label has been a competitor, have been in a lot of categories for extended period of time. And so we continue to focus on what we do best and that is building our number one and number two leading brands. If we do that and have leading brand positions, I mean, we'll be able to overcome any category challenge. So we don't see that it's escalated anymore than it has in the past. And I can say, we treat it like any other competitor and understand what it is that we have to do to be successful. Rupesh Parikh : Okay great. And switching topics to e-commerce, can you remind us the size of the business currently? And then some of the key efforts that you expect going forward in this area? Jim Snee : Sure, Rupesh. For us it's still a very small piece of our business. We have made some strategic investments of this year, creating our digital investment group. And so we've got the right structure in place. We're focusing our efforts around not only digital marketing, but e-commerce. And so we're not quite where we need to be, but believe that we're on the right track. We have the right structure and we'll get there with the team we have in place. Rupesh Parikh : Okay great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Carlson with KeyBanc. David Carlson : Thanks for taking the questions. With the union of the Specialty Foods and Grocery Products segments, it becomes a little bit more difficult to gauge the progress of the sales turnaround efforts of MUSCLE MILK by looking at the Specialty Foods segment on the standalone basis. So what give you guys confidence that the issues with CytoSport will start to improve in the latter half of the year? And what else might be required in the form of ongoing investment and sales turnaround efforts. And I've got a follow-up. Jim Snee : Sure, thanks, David. I mean, the one thing we want to be clear about is, I mean, we will continue to update you on our progress at CytoSport. It's a very important part of our portfolio and we want to make sure you understand the progress that we're making in that business. We're still rebounding from the impact to the recall we described to you last quarter, where we saw, obviously, we were off shelves, saw some increased competitive activity and we're working, continue to work to get pricing in our assortment correct. I mean, our new leadership team, in addition to working on pricing and assortment, is focused on the consumer and making sure that we're focused on the key attributes of our product offering. And for us, as we head into 2017, a key differentiator is we have very strong alignment with our strategic distribution partner, Pepsi. And working closely with them we\u2019ve made this, they have made this a top priority for 2018. We'll continue to make the necessary advertising investments in the business but having it at the top of their priority list is really an important part of the formula as well. So that's why we're optimistic heading into 2018 for CytoSport. David Carlson : That\u2019s a great answer. With respect to the pricing actions you guys took during the fiscal fourth, can you gives us just a little bit more clarity on exactly when those prices begin to have a positive impact on your P&L? And are any \u2013 with so many inputs seeming to be pretty volatile over the last couple of quarters, are there any other pricing actions that are in the process of being implemented? Jim Sheehan : Yes so the fourth quarter played out just like we told you on the third quarter the timing varied by category, but a broad statement, they took hold in the 11th period and that's really when we started to expect or experience the benefit. And what I would tell you is I talked earlier about some of price elasticity studies that we're doing to make sure we understand the impact that we've exceeded a lot of the pricing study expectations that we had when we took the price increases, obviously a very good sign. We do have some price increases in place for Q1 in our Grocery Products line with our Mary Kitchen corned beef hash and Dinty Moore Beef Stew. David Carlson : Thank you for the time. Jim Sheehan : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Eric Larson : Yes good morning all. And happy Thanks Giving. Jim Sheehan : Same to you Eric. Eric Larson : Just two \u2013 one question on pricing in the Grocery Products division. I know that you took some pricing, I believe, midyear last year in fiscal 2017 to offset some of the higher belly and both the pork and beef trim costs. Could you reiterate what the \u2013 kind of the timing of that was? And fiscal 2018 should benefit, I would assume at least for the first half from that. Will that be correct? Jim Snee : Yes so Eric so let\u2019s \u2013 may be we\u2019ll just kind of recap what we did in pricing in 2017. So in Refrigerated Foods, midyear, we had some pepperoni price increases as a result of the run-up in the beef trim market. We also saw an early run-up in the belly market which caused us to increase some bacon pricing. So that would have been Refrigerated Foods in the mid-part of the year that you referenced. And then as we got to the fourth quarter, we had another run-up on belly prices, so bacon was addressed again. And then we did have some other Grocery Products increases, chili and guacamole and peanut, butter in the fourth quarter. Eric Larson : Okay good. Thank you. That helps. I know there was a lot of activity there, so I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then just one other follow-up question here, Jim the kind of surprised me that the turkey market is still as depressed as it is. I think, we're about nine months sort of into kind of a lower profitability market and it's normally about a nine-months to 12-month cycle so it seems to be going on longer than normal. Is there something specific that's going on per se that \u2013 is there a change in why we haven't seen the start of a rebound in that turkey business yet? Jim Snee : We have talked about the rebound being more of a 12-month to 18-month cycle, Eric. And so we would expect that we would have seen some lower bulk placements by this point. But I think one of the things that we need to consider is coming out of AI, that we've got a lot of producers who are perhaps awaiting the next outbreak. And so that supply side continues to go, nobody is willing to give up on their supply quite yet. The other thing I would point you to is that even though in the midst of AI, there were supply issues, I mean, there were some record profitability. And so you have some probably better-than-average capitalized operators that could, I mean, be holding their breath, so to speak, a little longer. And I mean, we'll see. We're not quite where we think we need to be yet, but like I said earlier, we have cut our production. We're disappointed that we haven't seen the rest of the industry follow suit. Operator : And we'll go next to Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Hi good morning everyone. Jim Snee : Hi Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just going through \u2013 or kind of quantify the buckets of cost savings because, now, at this point, you have acquisitions, you have the combination of Grocery and Specialty, you have the supply chain savings, you have China and I believe that you have still corporate expenses. Can we bucket them in terms of kind of giving us both the actual numbers or kind of figure out how much it is? And how long it will go for, so we can kind of contextualize this beside \u2013 bringing from an abstract level to actually something to kind of bring it down to my level? Jim Snee : Sure, that\u2019s a great question Ken. And I mean, I would tell you that we've had a number of different initiatives across the organization and we've seen some of the benefits. But part of this whole supply chain alignment is to make sure that we have our focus on getting the right structure and process in place. And so today, we're not in a position to offer you those buckets. I think from our perspective, we're starting with this supply chain organization, today it was just announced. We've got to get the structure in place, so that we have better alignment across the organization. I think, on one hand, we've done \u2013 always done a good job of focusing our things from the bottom-up continuous improvement. But on the other hand, I mean, it's just time for us to take a more proactive top-down approach and we need to aggregate what those projects are, what the buckets are, what the savings are. So it's early in the process, but we certainly \u2013 to have had benefit, but our focus today is getting the structure and process in place. Ken Zaslow : Will there be \u2013 I mean how long will this go on? Any sort of, and this will be my follow-up so I won't ask anymore, but to me, it just seems like \u2013 will this go on for three years? Is there some sort of plan that this is going to reduce cost structure? And again, there's five or six different plans out there and you guys are definitely keeping busy, I'm just trying to figure out what is the time line and the magnitude of this? Are we talking about 100 basis points of margin? Are we talking about 400 basis points of margin? Are we talking about over a three-year period? Are we talking about over a five-year period? Just some sort of \u2013 something to grasp on would be helpful? It seems like you are doing a lot. Jim Snee : Yes we are doing a lot, we're doing a lot of good things. I mean, this is not going to be a one-hit wonder. I mean, this is going to be an ongoing multiyear approach, but the fact is the big driver around our supply chain is it's just announced today. And so we do have to get the structure, the process in place because, I mean, we know that with a fragmented supply chain, it inherently allows for the duplications and inefficiencies I talked about earlier. So this is going to be ongoing. It's not a one-year wonder, but again, we've got to get the organization in place, up and running so that the focus can be on the process. Ken Zaslow : And similar for the combination of the Specialty Business as well, is that also a cost-savings initiative? Jim Sheehan : Yes and this is Jim Sheehan and I would say that the one thing I'd disagree is that there's multiple plants. There's really one strategy around managing our costs. We're really taking this top-down approach that Jim has talked about. So we're setting the standards, we're setting the goals, we're setting the expectations at a very high level. So yes, the combination of Grocery Products and Specialty is a part of the strategy that Jim laid out all the way back to Investor Day about improving our supply chain. So it is engaging every level of the staff, but it is being driven from the top. The other thing is that I'd tell you, Ken, is that it's in the early stages and I think you've seen some of the results already. You could look at the financial statements and see where we've taken reductions and costs out of the staff, out of the expenses. But would we get into the broader levels, supply chain, how we go-to-market, that's when you'll start to see the bigger savings. As Jim said, I look at this and this is not well defined, but I look at this as probably a four-year project and then it's restructuring the way that we look at things. So there will be a savings that will go on well beyond this year. Jim Snee : And Ken, going back to your question around Grocery Products and Specialty Foods, I mean, just focus on the fact that there's a lot of shared resources in those businesses both from an operational and support perspective. They operate in similar channels. The brand or the business management is very similar. And so again, it goes back to the alignment and utilization of resources from a cost side. And then as I mentioned in my comments, over time, we think that there'll be some revenue synergies as well. So probably doesn't get you where you want to be, but I think understand it's early and this is a high priority for the organization. Ken Zaslow : I appreciate it. Thank you guys. Operator : We'll go next to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi I think Ken did his best on the savings question, but I've got to say that I'm not used to seeing big announcements like this without some sort of restructuring charge and restructuring savings kind of quantification and maybe that's just because \u2013 maybe four-year time frame, Jim and Jim, I'm just not used to that and I'm wondering why did you consider \u2013 or why did you choose to announce it this way? Is it just because it's too soon and we're going to get something in a few months? Or is it just the nature of this is we're going to get the process right and then we're going to get the savings as we go along? Jim Snee : Robert I think your latter comment is spot on. For us, this goes back to our need to optimize the supply chain. I mean, if we think about what we have become over time in terms of the number of production facilities that we have, the number of items, the number of supply ingredients, the number of co-packers that we now utilize, those have all been very thoughtful additions to support our business over time. But I mean, we just need to get the organization aligned because it is somewhat fragmented today. And so it's exactly what you said, is the focus is getting the structure and the process in place because it doesn't exist in an aligned manner today. So in terms of major, I'll say, restructuring charges, we don't have that on the horizon. From our perspective, we believe that this is going to be about alignment and the top-down approach, which is going to be a different way of thinking about this supply chain. Robert Moskow : Okay. And I think, Jim Sheehan, you said that we should be able to see the administrative cost that came out in the quarter. Can you help us quantify exactly how much it is though because there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here including advertising down? Jim Sheehan : Yeah, advertising is down $25 million. So that would be, out of the $50 billion that\u2019s down in SG&A, $25 million of it is advertising. There are other changes, but it has created a reduction in expenses already in 2017. And as Jim said, we\u2019ve been really focused on getting the structure right and it will continue to progress as we go into 2018. Jim Snee : Hey, Rob, the other thing I would remind you of is some of those general corporate expenses, we have made investments back in our business, one of the earlier callers had a question around our digital efforts. So I mean, we\u2019ve been able to fund some strategic investments with the savings we achieved also. Robert Moskow : But you\u2019re comparing us to 14-week period a year ago. Is SG&A kind of unrelated to the extra week? Or is there a relationship between those \u2013 would SG&A be higher on a 14-week period a year ago? Jim Sheehan : It has a minor impact. Robert Moskow : Minor impact. Jim Sheehan : Minor impact. Robert Moskow : And can I ask a question about bacon specifically. You\u2019ve been raising price \u2013 you\u2019ve raised prices twice, it seems like the whole category raised prices. But then belly prices started falling like literally the day after you talked about it on the last earnings call. So do you have any insight as to what the category is going to do next in response to the falling belly prices? Jim Snee : Well, I mean, it did just what you described. I mean, after we talked about it, it did decrease. But as of late, we\u2019ve seen some increases. We\u2019ve seen the market going back up. And so we\u2019ve \u2013 in Jim Sheehan\u2019s comments, we try to give you the outlook as to what we think the belly market is going to do. But I mean, it\u2019s been a very volatile market, there\u2019s no doubt about it. And that\u2019s, I mean, we\u2019re watching it closely. I mean, we\u2019re pulling all available levers and of course working closely with retailers to make sure that we\u2019ve got a mutually beneficial outcome. Robert Moskow : Got it. All right, thank you. Jim Snee : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. Jeremy Scott : Hi, good morning. Jim Snee : Hi, Jeremy. Jim Sheehan : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Scott : Just to square up the last 10 minutes or so. You still have that 16% to 20% margin target by 2020 and so that would bring you to about a three-year period, and would I have to \u2013 I assume that \u2013 can I bucket this into the cost-led realignment of the supply chain; number two, the organic recovery of turkey and the value-add portion of Refrigerated Foods; and then third, M&A? And how would you piece each \u2013 how would you apportion each of those as you move from 14% to the bottom end of that range? Jim Snee : Yeah, Jeremy, I mean, we think about it in perhaps a slightly different way. As we look at our business, I mean, obviously, we know that we\u2019re competing in a number of advantaged areas. That will allow us to continue to grow the top line and so we talked about our Mexican portfolio, our foodservice business, what\u2019s happening with SKIPPY and peanut butter \u2013 or SKIPPY and Justin\u2019s in the nut butters category, our International business and of course what will be coming with the acquisition of Columbus. That is a going to support, obviously, the growth of the top line, a very strong focus on innovation. I referenced in my comments the great progress that we\u2019ve made against our 15% by 2020 goal since we\u2019re now at 14% and of course a lot of that is driven by the great work we do with consumer and operator insights. We know that we\u2019re going to continue to be good stewards of our capital, invest for growth whether it\u2019s internal, our value-added expansions for Dold and dry sausage, the accretive acquisitions that we\u2019re making. And then, as you described, I mean, some of the efficiencies that we need to continue to gain and the supply chain structure, the supply chain organization, is going to be a part of that journey to get us to that margin goal. Jeremy Scott : Got it. And just a follow up on turkey and the basis of the recovery shape that you\u2019re expecting in 2018. Do beef supplies need to thin out for JOTS to truly recover? Jim Snee : Now we\u2019re looking this. We\u2019re at this looking at this right now as purely a turkey issue. This is our own industry issue and we need to make sure that others are following suit to get us where we need to be. But I would tell you, if we think about some of the value-added items, our lean ground turkey continues to take share from the beef category. So I mean, we\u2019re making progress on the value-added side. This really is a supply chain, commodity-driven issue. Jeremy Scott : Got it. And just quickly, what are you expecting for full year interest expense? Jim Sheehan : About $16 million. Jeremy Scott : Got it. Thank you. Jim Sheehan : And that obviously takes into account the Columbus acquisition. Jeremy Scott : Right, thanks. Jim Snee : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Akshay Jagdale : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the CapEx, and I only have my model going back to fiscal 2000, so bear with me. But I mean, this is, by far, the highest CapEx rate percentage of sales, however, you want to look at it. So can you give us a little more color on what\u2019s maintenance and what the other buckets are? I mean, it\u2019s good to see companies getting more and more aggressive with the balance sheet and allocating cash. So maybe you can just give us some buckets and maybe talk about the broader sort of balance sheet strategy, right? That would be helpful. Jim Sheehan : Certainly, good morning, Akshay. This is Jim Sheehan. We talk about \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about the past that we\u2019re probably looking at the range of $80 million to $100 million of maintenance in this year, which is in an unusual level. The CapEx that we\u2019re discussing includes the bacon expansion at Dold, that\u2019s $139 million project. It\u2019s on the early stages, so we probably have another $100 million left as we look at it; the Melrose plant, there\u2019s another $100 million that we have budgeted in 2018 to finish that project, $40 million in Austin; value-added capacities, those projects that are focused on various other high-margin products expanding the capacity make up about another $85 million of it. So is that helpful? Akshay Jagdale : Yeah, super helpful. And just put it into sort of the broader context. Obviously, over the last several years, we have seen the company get more aggressive on M&A, which has been great, but you have kind of a good problem where you keep generating a ton of cash and I see this as a \u2013 the first time we\u2019ve seen a pretty significant step-up in CapEx. So maybe you can just help us understand, should we expect this type of increase for the next couple of years? And related to the questions about the supply chain realignment, maybe over the next couple of years, you\u2019re not investing in bacon and some of these plants, but maybe you need to invest some cash to generate those savings. So just, overall, like what is the right rate of CapEx over the next couple of years? And why now sort of a big pickup? Jim Sheehan : I will do my best here. The first thing that I would like to focus on is the discipline we have when we make an investment. And I think some have heard me say before that I look at investment of capital, the allocation of capital, between CapEx and M&A really being determined by the best use of the capital. You\u2019re right, we\u2019ve had a lot of acquisitions recently, $1.3 billion, but we continue to have a very strong cash flow. And the acquisitions are enhancing that cash flow. So from the standpoint of concern about the cash flow, we\u2019re very confident about our cash flow. Part of our \u2013 part of the working capital that\u2019s coming up this year or the CapEx requirement is just a matter of timing. If we would have started these projects a little bit earlier in the year, it would have been split on a more balanced basis between 2017 and 2018, but capital projects that are this large quite often have their own schedule. We do not see the $425 million as the new run rate, but as the business increases, to go back and to look at the historical spend, we\u2019d probably understate it to some degree as we\u2019ve done additional acquisitions, that\u2019s going to increase the amount of maintenance, the amount of CapEx that\u2019s required. Akshay Jagdale : That\u2019s helpful. And just one on Refrigerated Foods, if I may. So I don\u2019t know if you broke this out, but maybe you can remind me again what the EBIT expectation for that segment is? I know you mentioned it, but I may have missed it. The reason I\u2019m asking is I really would like you to maybe dissect that between what are the acquisitions adding, you know, in my estimate around $70 million from the one that you\u2019ve already completed including synergies and then maybe another $25 million from the one you are about to close. But just trying to understand sort of how much of it is acquisition-related just so that we get a sense for the base business excluding acquisitions. What do you need to do to get to your guidance, right? That\u2019s essentially what I\u2019m trying to get at. Thank you. Jim Snee : Sure, Akshay. As you think about earnings for Refrigerated Foods, we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to be low single digits in 2018. From an acquisition perspective, with the guidance that we\u2019ve given in 2018, Fontanini will be $0.03 to $0.04. The full year impact of Farmer John will probably be $0.01. I mean the headline here again for Refrigerated \u2013 those were important factors, but the headline still really comes down to value added, being able to offset the decrease in some of the commodity profits. And so where we\u2019re at with the Refrigerated Foods business is we believe it\u2019s never been fundamentally stronger. And what we\u2019re doing on the acquisition side only strengthens it. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about and how we\u2019re modeling that to the low single-digit earnings for 2018. Akshay Jagdale : And just one last one on that and I really appreciate you giving the incremental color on this. The commodity profits, there is a view, there is some concerns that you \u2013 your commodity profits represented a greater percentage of the total segment earnings over the last couple of years. I know you mentioned 2017 was modestly above the long-term average that you presented at Analyst Day. But just can you be a little bit more granular there because there is this view that if the pork processing commodity margins go from $30 a head on average over the last couple of years to $10 or 0, that there could be significant declines in your base business. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get at. I mean you have obviously come out and said that that\u2019s not going to \u2013 I mean that volatility doesn\u2019t translate into your earnings, but I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of that. So if you could help on the commodity piece and what percentage of earnings it\u2019s been, that would be super helpful. Thank you. Jim Sheehan : This is Jim Sheehan again. I guess, the first thing I\u2019d want you to focus on is our acquisitions, none of which have a commodity component to them. So our acquisition strategy is reducing our dependence on those commodity \u2013 that commodity profitability. In 2017, our \u2013 we have talked about in Investor Day that it was about 15% of Refrigerated Foods, but the additional acquisitions will reduce that percentage because Fontanini, which is in our plan in right now and eventually Columbus will both push that percentage down. We\u2019ve said that it\u2019s going to be lower, moderately lower than last year. Jim Snee : And Akshay, I would point you to Nathan. I think you guys can have a conversation to follow up, if that\u2019s okay. Akshay Jagdale : Perfect, I will follow up. Thank you. Jim Snee : Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. I want to offer my sincere appreciation to all of our inspired people who make inspired food each and every day. And I know that they will continue to challenge themselves in 2018 to hit the key results that we\u2019ve set for ourselves going forward. I want to wish all of you a very happy Thanksgiving. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We\u2019d like to welcome Hormel back to CAGNY for the last presentation of the day. Please join me in thanking the company for sponsoring a tasting of new products right outside this room following this presentation. Hormel has been busy today having just reported earnings this morning and thank you very much for coming. Hormel is a 125 year old company with $9 billion of sales in branded foods and meat products. Hormel has been acquisitive in growing into a broader food company and continues to invest in faster growing channels. We have today Jim Snee, Chairman, President and CEO and Jim Sheehan, SVP and CFO. While this is Jim Snee\u2019s second time presenting at CAGNY. This will be his first time presenting as Chairman, President and CEO.  Now let's kick it off. Jim Snee? Jim Snee : Great. Well, thanks, Janet, and thanks to all of you for sharing the end of your day with us. Jim Sheehan and I are truly pleased to be in sunny Florida, because about six hours from now we are going to have a much different environment after we get back home to Minnesota. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here to share our first quarter results, update you on our progress against several key initiatives and provide more detail on the next growth engine for Hormel Foods.  As you would expect, we will be sharing some forward-looking statements that may differ from actual results and you can see a detailed list of risk factors in our recently filed Annual Report which is available on our website. It was a primer for those of you who may not be as familiar with our business; Hormel Foods is a $9.2 billion company with approximate market cap of $18 billion. And we are ranked number 8 as one of the top corporate citizens and we take a lot of pride in that ranking as we believe that\u2019s a true testament to our inspired team of over 20,000 people.  We have been around now for 126 years and we\u2019ve got a very long track record of success on a number of different fronts. We have been able to deliver earnings growth 28 out of the last 32 years and we\u2019ve been able to increase our dividend every year for the last 52 years including double-digit increases over the last nine years.  And our business operates in four distinct reporting segments, the largest of which is Refrigerated Foods and represents approximately 50% of our sales. And think about the business being one-third refrigerated retail, one-third food service and the remaining one-third being fresh pork and some of our subsidiaries. This portfolio continues to be focused on value-added branded sales growth. Grocery products is our next largest segment at about 25% of our sales and has some of the strongest and most iconic brands across its ever-broadening portfolio. Brands like SPAM, which celebrated its 80th birthday last year and also had record sales in 2017, along with Skippy, which has been a great core business for us and also a fantastic innovation platform as our Skippy PB Bites were selected as the most innovative new item in the grocery industry last year. And those iconic legacy brands are now joined by some of our more recent brands like Justin\u2019s, and Wholly Guacamole. Jennie-O Turkey Store is our vertically integrated turkey business focused on putting more turkey on more plates. On-trend brands like Jennie-O lean ground turkey and Jennie-O Oven Ready turkey continue to resonate and grow with today\u2019s consumer.  And finally, our international segment is our smallest segment, but offers us a lot of opportunity and we operate this business through a combination of exports, joint venture and licensing partnerships and multinational, in-country businesses both in China and now Brazil. And we do have a very strong branded presence across the entire food space. I talked about our international business, which is housed entirely in our international segment. But our Food Service business, which is about 30% of our business is housed in both our Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store business. With our Food Service business, we sell to a number of different segments, so think about hotels, restaurants, hospitals, colleges and universities. On the retail side of the business, which is over 60% of our business, we\u2019ve got very strong brands in our Refrigerated Foods business, in our Jennie-O Turkey Store and in our Grocery Products segment. We have 35 brands that are number one or number two in the categories in which they compete and we cover the entire footprint of any retail grocery store with those 35 brands. So there aren\u2019t too many places that you can go into a retail outlet and not come across a strong Hormel brands. At our 2017 Investor Day, we outlined our business imperatives and I am pleased to report that we have made tremendous progress since that time. We talked about evolving to a broader food company and while that certainly is about our product portfolio, it is also about meeting the consumer, when, where and how they are shopping and the acquisition of Columbus Craft Meats puts us squarely in the sweet spot for where today\u2019s consumers are shopping. We are expanding and accelerating our Food Service business through the acquisition of Fontanini and value-added capital expenditure investments like the one we are making in Wichita Kansas to support our growing retail and Food Service franchises. We are increasing our global presence with the Brazilian acquisition of Ceratti and capital investments that we\u2019ve made in China. And we will continue to evaluate all facets of our business to make sure that we have alignment with our growth strategies and where we don\u2019t, we will take the appropriate action. And our teams continue to move more and more business away from commodity sales into branded value-added sales as we look to reduce volatility and increase balance in our portfolio. And finally, we are in the process of modernizing our supply chain. We have made good progress, but we still have work to do. And we will continue to drive towards our corporate key results with our unmatched ability to develop and grow brands, our relentless quest to drive accretive innovation and continuing to find strategic acquisitions that allow us to continue to grow and evolve. So there are few key messages that we want you to take away from today. Obviously, we reported our first quarter earnings, a strong quarter of earnings growth and we also increased our guidance for fiscal year 2018. Since CAGNY seems to always fall, during our first quarter earnings release, we will take this opportunity to provide more color about the quarter and what the rest of the year has in store for us. Second, the benefit of tax reform clearly provides additional funds to invest into our business and allows us to enhance our invest and grow approach for the balance of 2018 and beyond.  And our third key message is to provide a deeper dive into our most recent acquisition, Columbus Craft Meats and detail for you why and how we see this as our company\u2019s next growth engine. So this morning we announced our 2018 first quarter results and we\u2019re pleased to report a quarter of strong earnings growth. We had a record quarter driven by a strong performance from Grocery Products, as well as the positive impact of tax reforms. Now these were partially offset by the continued oversupply situation at Jennie-O Turkey Store and significant freight increases with the biggest impact of those freight increases coming in our perishable freight, both in Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store. On a segment basis, this is the first time we are reporting a merged Specialty Foods and Grocery Products segments. First quarter sales growth came from numerous brands across the portfolio including Wholly Guacamole, Muscle Milk, HERDEZ, and SPAM. Our MegaMex joint venture and lower SG&A expenses help drive earnings growth. Our Specialty Foods and Grocery Products team are working on the integration of those two divisions into the new Grocery Products. And this is what the new Grocery Products will look like. Our private-label business is being merged into the existing simple meals pillar.  These businesses utilize the same production assets and will now have the same reporting and decision-making structure. We\u2019ve seen our grocery products portfolio evolve over time. And the addition of CytoSport Muscle Milk will provide another strong branded business under the pillar of functional nutrition. And our new leadership team at CytoSport is making great progress with this business. Refrigerated Foods saw sales growth across its very broad and branded portfolio. Food Service brands like Hormel Bacon 1 and MASTERPIECES Pizza toppings were joined by retail brands like Black Label Bacon and Applegate.  Earnings were impacted by the divestiture of Farmer John, which is now annualized after the first quarter, Columbus acquisition costs and higher freight cost. We also saw continued input cost volatility which was expected for fiscal 2018.  Jennie-O Turkey Store continues to face industry oversupply pressure. Continued sales growth for Jennie-O lean ground turkey and Jennie-O oven ready turkey were offset by lower whole bird sales. Reduced harvest levels, lower commodity prices, and increased freight costs all pressured profits. Turkey breast markets were lower than last year and below our expectations. We planned to continue to invest in this strong brand through advertising and promotional spend in order to keep this brand front and center with both operators and customers. Our International business was in line with our expectations. Sales increased with the addition of Ceratti, increased exports and strong business in China. Production of SPAM is now up and running in-country in China and sales are contributing to the top-line. Higher input cost for exports negatively impacted margins. Now I\u2019d like to also take this opportunity to update you on the progress we are making since the announcement of our reorganized supply chain. I want to reiterate that we do not have a broken supply chain, but we do have a complex supply chain with over 30 plants, a broad co-packer network using over 10,000 supply items to make over 10,000 SKUs. Now over the years, we\u2019ve done a nice job with our bottom up continuous improvement process. However, there is work that we need to do to take a more top down approach to simplify, modernize, optimize and where appropriate, perhaps rationalize.  Now we told you that we were focused on the structure and the process. We\u2019ve made good progress on the structure. We now have Glenn Leitch in place as the Executive Vice President of Supply Chain and he has been in place officially for about a month as we work through other transitions backfilling his position. As for the process, we are confident in our ability to identify and capture efficiencies, but continue to improve our ability to purposely retain and allocate those efficiencies. Our supply chain structure is built on four somewhat redundant platforms and we know there will be significant efficiencies available by combining into one strategic and integrated supply chain.  So as we look to the full year, we are increasing our guidance from the current range of $162 to $1.72 to a range of $1.81 to $1.95. Our expectations for Refrigerated Food, Grocery Products and International have not changed. We are expecting a slower than planned recovery at Jennie-O Turkey Store, as well as continued freight pressure. The positive impact of tax reform is increasing earnings. We\u2019ve recognized that this is a complex reconciliation from our previous guidance to our new guidance. While there are some headwinds related to the Jennie-O business and freight, the cash benefit of tax reform has allowed us to take and invest and grow approach versus a protect and defend approach. We are making investments this year that we would not have otherwise made. We are making new investments in our people, brands, communities, as well as automation and technology. And as we always do, we\u2019ll be monitoring key industry dynamics closely.  It is now my pleasure to turn things to over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial strategies. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon. I\u2019ll start by identifying a few key factors impacting our Q1 results and the remainder of the year. I will provide insight into each of these factors including our outlook. In the turkey industry, pulp placements and cold storage inventories are key indicators of market conditions. The chart on the left shows pulp placements.  As you can see, pulp placements have fluctuated, but we are not seeing sustained decreases. As the chart on the right indicates, inventory levels remain above last year. The continued high cold storage inventories that oppress markets and pulp placement metrics have tampered our expectation for turkey for the remainder of the year. At the pork industry, we continue to focus on exports and domestic demand, as well as the balance between production capacity and hog supply. Export demand remains robust. Domestically, pork continues to clear the market at favorable prices. As we expected, hog prices were volatile in the first quarter. We expect continued short-term volatility to occur as additional production comes online.  The hog supply increased 3% last year and we expect an additional increase of 3% to 4% in 2018. As shown on the chart, cold storage inventories are returning to normalized levels. We feel the additional capacity is impacting inventory levels and will eventually provide us with additional sources of raw material. We also feel inventories returning to normalized levels will decrease the volatility in the markets. Our analysis supports that under the existing market conditions, our current harvest level provides the company with favorable raw material cost. We are closely watching the fundamentals. We have the flexibility to adjust our source of raw materials based on long-term changes in market conditions.  Key markets were generally aligned with expectations for the quarter, but the continued short-term volatility remains a challenge. The chart shows the volatility at the belly market since 2017. The magnitude and speed of the changes demonstrates the challenges of managing margins and forecasting consumer demand.  Although less dramatic in bellies, volatility is also impacting the company with hog, hog sport trim and beef. Some of the earnings fluctuations we are seeing in quarterly results are driven by the timing of the market changes. With the exception of turkey, we still expect market trends to be in line with our overall expectations at the beginning of the year. Although we plan for much higher freight cost, the level of increases exceeded our expectation. Freight expenses negatively impacted the first quarter , especially Refrigerated and Jennie O. We are working with our customers to find mutually beneficial solutions that are sustainable and will mitigate the impact for the remainder of the year.  Hormel will receive a significant benefit from tax reform on both an earnings and cash flow perspective. Along with the lower statutory rates, the first quarter benefited from the one-time reduction of our deferred tax liability resulting in an effective tax rate of 0.6% for the quarter. We expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 17.5% and 20.5%.  The long-term expected tax rate is between 21.5% and 24.5%. The cash flow benefit from tax reform in 2018 is approximately $110 million. The long-term impact will be between $100 million and $140 million annually. The impact will allow us to provide enhanced shareholder return while investing in our business, employees and communities. Investments in the business will begin in the second quarter. We will provide additional support to advertising, and promotional activities. In 2018, we expect to increase advertising expenses in excess of 20% above last year. The company will invest additional capital into projects focused on plant automation, technologies and value-added capacity. Investing in our people at Hormel \u2013 people and communities is a priority for Hormel. The lowest allowable starting rates will be increased to $14 per hour by the end of 2020. We recently announced stock option grants for all 21,000 employees and we are increasing community donations by $25 million over the next five years. In the first quarter, operating cash flow increased 56%. Beginning in the second quarter, our strong cash flow will be enhanced by the impact of tax reform. As Jim has already stated, our long history of increasing our dividends. We are committed to maintaining our dividend, Aristocrat membership by continuing to increase dividends in the future.  We will continue to repurchase shares to offset stock option dilutions and based on our evaluation of the market.  Previously, we have communicated our goal of optimizing the balance sheet for growth. We utilized the balance to make $1.4 billion worth of acquisitions in the past year. 2018 also represents the largest capital expenditures in the company\u2019s history at $425 million as we modernize and expand our facilities to support value-added and innovative products. We currently have $880 million in debt and the clear capacity to make additional investments through disciplined acquisitions and internal projects. We have taken all of these actions while maintaining our investment grade rating.  These are the key initiatives to organize the business for growth and focus on strategic cost management. The goal of strategic cost management is not to just cut cost. The goal is to deliver long-term growth. It is a thoughtful approach of reallocating resources to strategic initiatives while finding efficiencies and synergies throughout the organization.  The Fontanini, Columbus, Grocery Products, Supply Chain and Deli integrations are in progress. We are on track to attain the expected synergies in 2018 and we have found second phase synergies for the future. Zero basing was implemented in selected departments last year has already delivered benefits. Zero basing is being expanded into the remainder of the business including supply chain, sales and subsidiaries. We are developing tools and processes to validate and communicate our progress in capturing and retaining the identified savings. Before disclosing the savings, our priority is to assure the information as accurate and reliable.  Thank you. I\u2019ll now pass the presentation back to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Well, great. Thanks, Jim, great update on a very complex but beneficial topics. The third key message and final part of our presentation this afternoon is focused on our company\u2019s next growth engine and that our newly created Deli division.  And make no mistake about it, Hormel is poised to win in the Deli. It\u2019s the right category to be in with the right portfolio of product offerings and strong brands including the newly acquired Columbus Craft Meats brand. The growth of the Deli is far outpacing other parts of the retail outlet. And in fact, it\u2019s outpacing total food by over four times. And not only is that Deli growing at a faster rate of other parts of the store, it\u2019s growing its footprint as more and more space continues to be allocated to this very important part of any retailer\u2019s business.  And this Deli business is made up of four key areas. The first of which is behind the glass and this is what we all remember as the Deli, right, either whole pieces of meat, sliced to your preference or more recently, a wide array of already sliced product and I will tell you, the rumors about the demise of behind the glass are a bit presumptuous as you can see, this remains a sizable and growing segment with premium brands fueling this growth.  The next segment is Grab and Go. And Grab and Go is where you will find typically pre-packaged meats, pre-packaged cheeses or perhaps a combination of the two. Next, prepared foods, this is no longer about just macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes.  As consumers continue to have less and less time, they are now including this area of the store in their consideration set for on-the-go food and retailers are looking for higher quality, signature offerings. And finally, in-store restaurants are what many of us know as Grocerants. Many times they are freestanding restaurants within the retail outlets, but wherever they are, it\u2019s clear that this is the wheelhouse of our strong branded Food Service business. And all of these segments combined, they are all significant in size and growing. Combined, this is a $35 billion opportunity and growing. But the opportunity in growth doesn\u2019t come without challenges for today\u2019s retailers. Whether it\u2019s finding labor, dealing with shrink or dealing with changing consumer preferences. Our solutions-based approach takes the burden away from our retail partners. We have the right products, and insights to keep this business growing and relevant.  And while the shopping landscape continues to evolve and change, traditional retailers continue to have a unique point of difference to attract customers. They can provide a very authentic and fresh experience in an area where consumers come to discover, and are inspired to try new products. And it\u2019s safe to say that today\u2019s consumers are all about the experience.  So one thing should now be crystal clear. This is not our parent\u2019s Deli. The Deli is no longer only a place where you order a pound of your favorite protein sliced to your desired thickness. Simply said, the Deli of the past is not the Deli of the future where today terms like quarter pound, half pound, paper thin, extra thick are joined by words like Charcuterie, artisanal, crafted, and millennials.  So, now you know what the Deli of today looks like and you also know why this sizable high growth category is so attractive and appealing, but none of this matters if there isn\u2019t a how and for us that how is the recent acquisition of Columbus Craft Meats that positions Hormel to compete and win in the Deli of the future.  For those of you who aren\u2019t as familiar with Columbus Craft Meats, allow me to formally introduce you to this great company that delivers premium products, premium growth and premium margins. And I\u2019d like to share a short video that highlights this amazing heritage and success.  So I think you can see why we are so excited to have Columbus as the newest member of the Hormel family. Because to compete and win in the Deli, you need to have a wide array of high-quality product offerings, being marketed and sold by a direct sales organization that has experience, expertise and relationships that can capitalize on having meaningful scale to provide a package of total Deli solutions. Hormel Foods is well-positioned to compete and win. And it starts with the products. Hormel Foods has always had a strong product representation in many of the Deli segments, but the acquisition of Columbus really helps us close some of those gaps with items like Charcuterie trays and high-quality artisanal meats.  Additionally, our unmatched array of Deli solutions far outpaces any of the competitors in this space and they simply cannot match the breadth or depth of our solutions.  Now we\u2019ve had strong behind the glass expertise with brands like Jennie O and Di Lusso Deli. We are the Turkey experts at Jennie O, the ham experts at Hormel and now we are the dry sausage experts with the addition of Columbus. The addition of our Applegate brand now affords us the opportunity to offer the leading natural and organic brand as well. We also bring innovation to the fast-growing Grab and Go section with our party tray gatherings and culinary pairings, while the addition of Columbus allows us to add authentic items like Columbus Paninos and salami. As you can imagine, we have a very long runway for growth with high-quality, signature offerings.  And no one provides food service solutions like Hormel does and we are incredibly well-positioned to deliver our host of branded solutions to prepared foods and in-store restaurants. Great food service brands like AUSTIN BLUES, Cafe H and now Fontanini are perfect solutions as retailers search for high-quality signature offerings.  And when you put it all together, we now bring unmatched knowledge in both Deli and Food Service. Expertise in bringing solution-based selling and game-changing innovation while leveraging incredibly powerful brands to this high growth area. Hormel, Hormel Food Service, Jennie O, Applegate, and now Columbus, truly a dream team of brands. And we are supporting this initiative by putting one of our best performers in charge of this new Deli division. Last week, we named Jeff Baker as the Group Vice President of Deli a newly created role. This role will consolidate all Deli sales into one highly focused division reporting into Refrigerated Foods. Jeff, most recently led our highly successful Food Service business and he also has deep retail Deli experience. He will be able to leverage our Food Service strategy as he understands how to manage and motivate a direct sales organization and provide thought leadership, solution-based selling and industry-changing innovations to the marketplace.  Now I said we had a large Deli business before acquiring Columbus, but the Columbus acquisition dramatically increases our points of distribution that can be leveraged against a much broader portfolio. Columbus also boosts our presence out west where we are traditionally weaker with our current Hormel brands. We believe we have a very long runway as we start to help Columbus migrate east successfully. Columbus brings an excellent direct sales force that is a perfect complement to our current sales team and will allow us to deliver our solutions-based selling model to any major retail channel. Combined, our new Deli group will be almost $1 billion in sales, which gives us meaningful scale. So Hormel is poised to take full advantage and win in this high growth, on trend Deli of the future and this is the next growth engine for Hormel Foods.  We are positioned to be the new leader in the Deli with approximately $1 billion in sales, aggressive growth expectations that are in line with category growth and our corporate growth goals and margins will be accretive over time.  Now the good news and Janet mentioned it upfront, we\u2019ve brought some of the great Columbus products today, and they are being served by some of the great team members from Columbus and we hope that you will be able to enjoy some of the premium craft meats and Charcuterie on your way out of our session. So to recap, three key messages for today. Strong first quarter earnings and increased guidance for fiscal year 2018. Tax reform does provide additional funds to invest in our business and third, our new Deli group will be the company\u2019s next growth engine.  I want to thank you for your time this afternoon and with our remaining time. Jim and Nathan and I would be happy to take any questions that you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Unidentified Analyst : Just wondering if you could give a little more color, you touched on this a little bit, but with the tax reform savings, it looks like if you take the midpoint of the prior tax rate range and new one that\u2019s maybe you have a $0.33 lift, does that seem about right? And could you give us a sense of how it breaks down in broad strokes at least some of the discretionary items versus maybe some freight headwinds.  And then, a little bit related to that, could you just touch on what some of your options are for how you are thinking about offsets on the freight side, is it just pricing, is there some flexibility and how you think about that and what kind of trajectory should we expect on how that might play out? Jim Snee : I\u2019m sorry, I missed the last part. Unidentified Analyst : Just in terms of the freight pressure, what are some of your ways to handle that and how long would it take to see some of those come through? Jim Snee : Okay, great. So, I think the first part in terms of the gap perhaps that you are talking about for the tax benefit. As you think about it, probably the best way we\u2019d say that about half of that could be allocated to the headwinds at Jennie O Turkey Store and freight. And then, the other half really would be allocated to some of the additional investments that we described.  I think the one thing that we want to be clear about, we said it in our presentation, but I think it\u2019s a very important piece in this idea of taking and invest and grow approach versus a protect and defend approach. I mean, we are making some investments this year that we would not have otherwise made. And so, it\u2019s giving us an opportunity to do that.  But that\u2019s really how you should think about probably the \u2013 perhaps the gap. On the freight side, we talked about having this co-operational collaboration with our customers, so that we can reach mutually agreed upon solutions that are sustainable. We know there is school of thought out there that says, it\u2019s all going through to the consumer.  We believe that we can work with our customers, whether it\u2019s how we're filling trucks, the routes that we're doing, the number of shipments that we can work hard to potentially offset that. Those conversations are taking place right now, but I mean, we don\u2019t have a timeline for when that\u2019s going to happen and the other part of it is, I mean, we are not opposed to passing along those freight cost, but before we get there, we certainly want to have those conversations to see if there is another way to reach a more sustainable solution. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Nathan Annis : Rupesh. Rupesh Parikh : Thanks for taking my question. So, on the Jennie O segment, I was wondering how you guys were thinking about the outlook for the balance of the year for Jennie O and then, if you look, I guess, post this year, when do you expect to return to potentially positive trends within that segment? Jim Snee : Do you have the breakdown, Nathan? The breakdown when it'd be more positive for the back half of the year, when it will become positive. Nathan Annis : I will follow-up on that. Jim Snee : Yes, Nathan will follow-up on, but I think for us, obviously this recovery has been slower than we expected. We have taken a pretty aggressive approach in how we were forecasting the whole bird market and it\u2019s been below even what we expected and so that\u2019s really been the key driver for the balance of the year and we are seeing some moderation in value-added pieces of business and now we\u2019ve got to work through this whole bird piece.  Jim\u2019s charts did a great job of identifying really the still continued volatility in pulp placements. We haven\u2019t seen the sustained declines and then also really still the elevated cold storage supply and we said those are really the two key variables that are going to get us out sooner than faster. Nathan Annis : Ken. Ken Zaslow : Two questions. With the investments, the recovery in turkey and cost savings, when will you return to your growth algorithm? And what would prevent you from achieving that in 2019? My second question is, can you frame the magnitude of savings in terms of order of magnitude, where we are seeing it from? Those are my two questions. Jim Snee : Yes, so, I mean, I think, as we think about 2019, obviously, it\u2019s early in the process, but the way we are thinking about it is we would expect recovery with Jennie O Turkey Store. We really like what we\u2019ve done with the Refrigerated Foods portfolio with the addition of Fontanini for Food Service, but we described to you today as the growth \u2013 the next growth engine for Columbus.  Our International business is going to continue to move right along. We feel good about what\u2019s happening in China, the addition of Ceratti. And Grocery Products, quite frankly is rock solid right now, so that core legacy portfolio, those pockets of growth are doing well. We saw improved performance from Muscle Milk. And so, I mean, we believe that that growth algorithm is still a very achievable number and from a cost perspective, I mean, a lot of what we\u2019ve been doing is what Jim described as strategic cost management. Jim Sheehan : I think one of the things to look at is the integration of the supply chain. If you think about running four separate supply chains that will go into one supply chain. If you think about everything from logistics, and warehousing and manufacturing, so that manufacturing plants become more available to the broad line of products. That probably provides us with the largest amount of opportunity for savings.  We will pick up the smaller savings along the way. I think the integration of Deli will provide great savings and synergies. Again, as you take three or four different groups that are trying to do things separately and you bring them into one. We see net savings by being very centralized in the back office and I think as we put that into the supply chain, you are going to see some big benefits. Ken Zaslow : Would be able to frame the number? Are we talking about $100 million, $200 million or $300 million, what are we talking about? Jim Sheehan : We are working on that right now the big issue is, is everybody has their own ideas about savings and very honestly, if I would have taken everybody\u2019s savings number that they originally gave me, they\u2019ll probably couple billion dollars, because everybody thinks they're going to save a lot of money. So we are going through and we are really drilling down on those.  So, what\u2019s going to get to the bottom-line? Our example that we view \u2013 you can have purchasing come in and say, we\u2019ve saved 5% on those packaging, but have cost in other packaging have gone up, we are coming back and saying now you\u2019ve held your packaging cost. The other thing is, how much we retain is a big issue for us.  You can come up with a savings number, but the less you retain it, delivered to the bottom-line, it\u2019s really not that \u2013 not benefiting the shareholders. So we are working hard to come up with a number. We are getting much closer. Nathan Annis : Akshay. Akshay Jagdale : Thanks. So the question, I just wanted to ask somewhat of a follow-up to what Ken was talking about, but over the long-terms, I am just really looking for your perspective here, because your \u2013 this year is unusual from a growth perspective right, if you take out the tax positive impact, which is going to be one \u2013 I don\u2019t know, thirty as you said, this is going to be thirty of earnings might be down, right.  So, it\u2019s \u2013 you are making a strategic investment, right, in terms of brand building and other capabilities, it seems like a great move long-term, but how do you delineate between sort of commodity moves that are sort of transitory that you might be dealing with on turkey and on pork versus sort of the strength of your brands and portfolio long-term.  So why do you have confidence is really the question, why do you have confidence that you are going to get good long-term returns on these investments when you in a sort of \u201ctransition year\u201d? Jim Snee : Yes, I mean, I think, specifically if you want to talk about turkey, I mean, we are probably the only company in the turkey space that really is advertising and supporting the brand and promoting the category. And we know that that\u2019s important to us, because we don\u2019t want to be \u2013 if we are not doing that, we run the risk of becoming just a commoditized company. And so, we believe that communicating the benefit of the brand and the value-added products is incredibly important, and so we are going to be back out in front. Several years ago, we ran to make the switch campaign. We did it again two years ago. Last year, as we got into the heat of the battle, we made some different decisions in terms of reallocating funds. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wise move to be off there or away from consumers for more than one year. So we are going to make sure that investment is front and center this year. And I mean, we have that mentality across all of our brands. We\u2019ve got 35 brands that are number one or number two and when we start talking about these pockets of growth that we have identified and we\u2019ve been able to capitalize on, a lot of it is because we are great brand builders. We are great innovators and so, we need to be able to continue to support that over the long-term. Unidentified Company Representative : And I think with that, we\u2019ll move the rest of the Q&A to the breakout. Please join me again in thanking Hormel for the Columbus tasting. And just as a reminder, please take all of your personal belongings as it\u2019s going to be lost and it will be in the office if you do leave anything.",

Please note that during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic net sales and organic volume. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report on our second quarter results this morning. Our team successfully navigated through macro and commodity headwinds this quarter to deliver record earnings per share of $0.44, up 13% and in line with our expectations. Our balanced business model allowed us to mitigate double-digit increases in freight, a dynamic park environment and continued oversupply in the turkey industry. The benefit from tax reform also contributed to our record results. Second quarter sales were also a record for our Company, and we are encouraged by many positive trends across our portfolio. Total Company sales for the quarter were up 7% on a 3% volume increase. The increases were driven by the recent strategic acquisitions of Ceratti, Columbus Craft Meats and Fontanini. On an organic basis, volume decreased 1% while sales were flat. Many value-added brands in each segment grew, but the gains were offset by lower results from Jennie-O Turkey store, CytoSport and our contract manufacturing business. Recent third-party consumption data supports the growth we are seeing across many of our brands and household penetration figures also suggest solid momentum, especially with millennials. In terms of segment performance, refrigerated foods grew segment profit 18% despite a difficult freight environment and a 25% decline in commodity profits. The strength of our value-added portfolio in both retail and food service coupled with lower input cost allowed us to generate strong growth. Sales increased 14% on a 6% volume increase, primarily related to the acquisition of Columbus Craft Meats and Fontanini. Our Hormel Natural Choice franchise showed very strong growth this quarter. The Natural Choice brand has been gaining share in the retail marketplace and with food service operators since its introduction in 2006. Over the past few years, the brand has evolved with the change in consumer preferences towards all-natural. We have broadened our offerings in the lunch meat category, while expanding into bacon, pepperoni and handheld snacks. This past quarter, we fully converted our rev product line to an all-natural formulation and re-launched the products under the Natural Choice brand. The results to-date have been impressive. We have increased our distribution, grown household penetration and improved in-store velocities. Natural Choice is a great example of how a strong brand combined with our culture of innovation to drive growth and expand over time. Food service sales of Hormel Bacon One fully-cooked bacon, Hormel fire braised meats and Caf\u00e9 H products, all generated excellent growth this quarter as we continue to partner with and deliver innovative solutions to operators who are facing time and labor challenges. We have successfully integrated Fontanini's manufacturing and logistics into our global supply chain, and are in the process of integrating the sales and marketing functions into our Hormel food service division. In addition to the Fontanini integration, the reorganization of our various deli businesses into refrigerated foods is well underway, and we are in the early stages of integrating the Columbus craft meats business. Both the Fontanini and Columbus acquisitions are on track and meeting expectations. Our international segment delivered sales growth of 22% on a volume increase of 14%, primarily related to the acquisition of Ceratti. Organic sales growth of 8% was driven by improved business in China, our SPAM sales in China continue to gain momentum, placing us ahead of our distributional expectations. International segment profit growth was 6% as improved profitability in China was partially offset by higher advertising expenses. Jennie-O Turkey store earnings declined 34%, while sales declined 4%. Lower whole bird pricing and volume drove the lower results this quarter. Jennie-O lean ground turkey and our Oven Ready brand continued to perform well. As a reminder, our grocery products and specialty foods teams merged as of the beginning of this fiscal year, and we now report consolidated results as grocery products. For the quarter, our core grocery products portfolio continued to remain healthy and vibrant, delivering low single-digit sales growth, led by establish brands such as SPAM, Dinty Moore and Hormel chili as well as emerging brands such as Wholly Guacamole and Herdez. The gains in our center store portfolio were not able to offset the decline in sales from CytoSport and our contract manufacturing business. Total grocery rate product segment profit was down due to increased promotional activity and lower volumes at CytoSport, and lower earnings from our contract manufacturing business. The CytoSport business is facing numerous headwinds. Our team understands the various dynamics in each of the key channels. Our challenges lie primarily in our convenience store and specialty channel businesses. We are having success in the food, drug and mass channel, which will continue to be an area of focus for us as we work to grow the MUSCLE MILK brand. While this business is not where we expected to be, the move into the grocery products segments will provide more branding and marketing resources and I expect that shift will return CytoSport to growth. Turning to our second half outlook. We expect a strong finish in many of our businesses. We expect grocery products to continue their strong momentum in our core portfolio into the second half and return to growth. For Jennie-O Turkey store, we still expect earnings to decline in the back half compared to last year. Beginning next quarter, the commodity pressures we felt in our value added businesses last year will be annualized but we will not lap the declines in the whole bird business until the first quarter of 2019. Our successful Make the Switch campaign will return this summer supporting our lean ground turkey and other value-added businesses. Signs of supply reductions are encouraging and we see Jennie-O Turkey store returning to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019. The outlook remains positive for our international segment as we continue to capture the benefits from our new plant in Joshing China. To-date, we have been successful exporting pork around the world. However, given the uncertain impact of the tariffs on the pork industry, we are expecting modestly lower sales and margin in our export business. Favorable performance for our China meat business should offset the potential impact on export sales. Our view of refrigerated foods has not changed from the first quarter. We expect our value-added businesses in retail and food service, and the acquisitions of Fontanini and Columbus, to offset declines in commodity profits and freight headwinds. Jim Sheehan will provide insights into our view of the hog and pork industry, and where we continue to see volatility. This quarter, we saw a double-digit increase in per-unit freight costs, due to both the lack of availability of trucks and an increase in diesel fuel surcharges. We continue to work with our customers to find mutually agreeable solutions to offset these increases. Rising freight costs will continue to have an impact in the second half of 2018 and into 2019. Taking all these factors into account, we are reaffirming our sales guidance of $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion and our earnings guidance of $1.81 to $1.95 per share. As we think about the second half, we see a slightly higher cadence in the fourth quarter as we were dealing with the run-up in key input cost last year. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss the financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Volume for the second quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 3% increase compared to last year. We had record sales for the second quarter of $2.3 billion, a 7% increase. Organic volume decreased 1% and organic sales were flat. Net earnings were $237 million, up 13% compared to last year. Refrigerated foods benefited from our strategy of growing value-added sales through innovation and acquisitions, as well as the benefit of declining input costs. As Jim reported, refrigerated foods\u2019 profits were up 18%, while commodity profits declined 25%. Commodity profits reflect the fresh pork and provision sales less the cost to procure and process hogs. Commodity profits in the quarter were below the long-term benchmark of 15% of total refrigerated foods profits. Excluding advertising, selling, general and administrative expenses were 7.1% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A was flat on a dollar basis. Advertising expense this quarter was $37 million compared to $30 million last year. We expect to increase advertising by approximately 20% in 2018. We are currently advertising key growth brands, including SKIPPY, SPAM, Jennie-O and Natural Choice. General corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses, including healthcare. As you think about the remainder of the year, the universal stock option award made to our 20,000 employees will impact corporate expenses in the third quarter. This represents approximately $0.01 per share. Operating margins were 13.1%, a 130 basis point decrease compared to last year. The decline is primarily a result of lower margins at Jennie-O and CytoSport along with higher freight costs. Our effective tax rate was 20% compared to 33.2% last year. The lower tax rate provided $45 million benefit compared to the prior year. As we continue to assess tax reform, we have narrowed the range for our full year tax rate to be between 17.5% and 19.5%. Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flows of $443 million, up 58%. The increase was related to higher earnings and improved working capital as we communicated at Investor Day one of our priorities is to improve our cash conversion cycle. For the last 12 months, we took three days out of our cash cycle as all three components improved. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $87 million compared to $39 million last year. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $425 million in 2018. Projects include the replacement of our Melrose plant, the bacon expansion in Wichita, upgrades to the Austin plant, numerous capacity expansions and ongoing investments for food and employee safety. In the quarter, we paid $99 million in dividends at the annual rate of $0.75 per share. This marked our 359th consecutive quarterly dividend. Total debt is $810 million. This was split between short-term loans, which we plan to pay off this fiscal year, and long-term debt. We remain in a strong financial position to fund other investments. We repurchased $20 million in stock this quarter at an average price of $32.95 per share. Input costs for the second quarter were mixed. Hog prices were 9% lower than last year. As we communicated in prior quarters, our expectation is for low single-digit increases to hog prices in the back half of our fiscal year. We will continue to focus on three factors; export demand, domestic demand and total hog supplies, compared to industry capacity. Exports continue to be strong, and USDA forecast exports to be up 5% in 2018. We are watching export demand carefully. Domestic consumption remains very strong. Retail pork prices remain steady, and we continue to see pork clearing the market at current prices. We expect hog supplies to increase 3% to 4% this year. We continue to believe total hog supplies are well masked to industry capacity over the long-term. We remain vigilant in our assessment of the industry, and will make the necessary changes to ensure we are sourcing pork for our value-added products at the lowest possible cost. We continue to procure more raw materials externally, offsetting the 3% decrease in our existing hog harvest facilities. Deli prices were 20% lower than last year. We expect deli prices to remain volatile but in line with 2017 levels for the back half of the fiscal year. 72% pork trim prices were 5% below last year. We expect trim markets to be lower than 2017 levels and the back half. 50% beef trim was 7% lower compared to last year. We expect beef prices to be lower than 2017 levels. Market costs for beef were higher compared to last year. We expect beef cost to be higher year-over-year in the back half. We're starting to see the early signs of a recovery in the turkey industry. All placements have shown low single-digit declines in recent months. Industry harvest levels have decreased and turkey breast meat in cold storage is now below last year. Inventory of whole birds remains elevated at 14% above last year. Turkey breast meat prices increased during the quarter. Breast meat is currently trading around $1.84 per pound compared to $1.55 per pound at the beginning of the quarter. We expect moderate increases in turkey prices for the back half of the year. Whole bird prices are 19% lower than 2017 levels, and we do not expect a material change in pricing until the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Regardless of our market projections, the one constant in the current market is volatility. The second quarter demonstrates our ability to manage through volatility. Rapid changes in markets can affect results in the short term, but we have the capacity to adjust and continue growing earnings for our shareholders. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer\u2026 Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Akshay Jagdale of Jeffries. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [Lubi] on for Akshay. I wanted to ask question on turkey. So you mentioned that you're seeing some encouraging signs in the turkey business, it seems to be making your outlook for Jennie-O in fiscal \u201919 somewhat more positive. I\u2019m wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit more on what exactly you\u2019re seeing out there, and maybe what changed the most since the last quarter. I think you might have tempered expectations a little bit last time around. Jim Snee : Our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, they are continuing to navigate difficult industry conditions, but we are seeing signs of supply reductions. And we talked about the industry harvest, which is down 3% year-to-date. We are seeing pork placements down low single digits, which is a good metric. The cold storage inventories, we\u2019re seeing breast meat down 3%. On the other hand, we are seeing whole birds up 14%. As we\u2019re thinking through this, fairly those are some positive indicators for the business. But because of that run up in whole bird inventories and the decrease in the whole bird market, that\u2019s still going to have an impact on the back half of this year and into early 2019. But we do think these indicators are going to continue. And then of course through the work that we're doing on the value-added business with our Jennie-O lean ground turkey our Oven Ready turkey items, we believe that we\u2019re still well-positioned to return to growth in the first half of 2019. Unidentified Analyst : And then if I could ask the question on the freight cost situation. So I know freight cost continue to be a challenge. And I think last time around, you had mentioned that you were starting to look at some measures to mitigate some of that impact. I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us a progress update on how that's been going. And to the extent that you are looking at pass some of that on, how have those conversations been going with some of your customers? Thanks. Jim Snee : As a reminder, freight is has been a headwind. We expect it to continue in the second half and into 2019. And we\u2019ve been working to solve it a few different ways. We did talk about working with our customers to find mutually agreeable solutions. And we\u2019re thinking about minimizing miles, maximizing weight, how many days a week do you need delivery. And I will tell you that our customers are very open to those discussions. Of course, we\u2019re working internally to make sure that we are as efficient as we can be. And then there are situations where we are taking pricing as well when we\u2019re unable to find those mutually agreeable solutions. So it is a variable plethora of things that we\u2019re working on. But again the big message here I think is that it's going to continue to be a headwind back half of this year and into 2019. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheim. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : So maybe to start out, as we look at your guidance range for this year, you guys reaffirm guidance. But you still kept a pretty wide range. So I was just curious, as you look at that range, what factors could drive the high-end versus the low end of the range? Jim Snee : The reason we kept the range where it is, we know that there's still volatility in the marketplace; and volatility in terms of what's happening in the pork industry; volatility in terms of what's happening in the freight industry; and so we felt that it was very appropriate to keep that range. From our perspective, as we think about the second half of the year, refrigerated foods is poised to have a strong second half. Our value-added business will continue to offset what we expect to be commodity declines; Jennie-O Turkey store going to continue to be up against industry oversupply pressures, and whole bird pricing. Our international business and we talked a little bit about what could potentially happen with tariffs in pork, but our business in China is doing quite well. And so I mean there's a number of things out there that can set us up for a strong second half and that's what we're expecting in our business. Rupesh Parikh : And then switching gears to CytoSport. So you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the challenges in the convenience and specialty channels. So I was curious as you look at the challenges there is that more -- is that category challenges, or is something changing from a competitive perspective? And what the plans are to improve performance within those two channels? Jim Snee : From our perspective, it's really a competitive issue. And we called out the C-store in the specialty channel, because that's where our challenges are. In the C-store business, we are still recovering from a third party recall in 2016. We thought we had some signs of life in the first quarter that didn't play out into the second quarter, so we know that we still have work to do to get our distribution back in line. Our brand teams are working on consumer messaging, and making sure that we have the right pricing. The specialty channel is something that is less competitive and probably more structural as sales in that channel continue to migrate online. We're working to move more of our sales online through our digital experience effort that we have going on. And so the other thing I would tell you is, at the beginning of year, we did merge specialty foods into grocery products. And we believe that that is going to offer the appropriate level of branding and marketing support. So we do expect results to improve in the back half. But I would tell you that that\u2019s mostly due to easy comps. Our bigger concern for the business is really getting it back to a healthy and sustainable growth level. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is open, please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Just two questions. One is can you give us an update on the cost savings program, where is that right now, what is your technology to be able to capture the synergies, where are you on that? That's the first question. Thank you. Jim Snee : So we told you in Q1, Ken, that we're working to get the structure and process in place. We've had Glenn Leitch heading up our supply chain now for all of four months. And we are making progress in that area, and our focus is on progress. He's been very busy working on a number of different things, operational consistency, labor utilization, looking at our broad co-packer network. We had a question already around fright, and he has been active in that space. And so we are still in, I would say, the structure process and progress mode, and we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. But we are still not where we need to be in terms of the methodology. Ken Zaslow : How long will that take before you have parameters in -- even if you don\u2019t give us the details, when will you guys have inside into what you will accomplish by when, and if that will impact 2019? Jim Snee : I think we have insights into what we\u2019re achieving. So we know what we\u2019re capturing. I think the issue for us is we want to make sure that those numbers, whether they are being reinvested are going through to the bottom line that is still a work in process for us. Cost savings, as we\u2019ve told you, is not new to us, it\u2019s something that we've had throughout our business for a very long time. We are just trying to take a more global approach to it. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : I guess my first question would be around refrigerated, and maybe just trying to get a little more color on the performance and the expectation with organic volumes still down year-on-year. Is that just a function of your lower harvest levels internally? And I mean the price mix was up year-on-year despite pork price declines, especially deli price declines. I am just trying to think about how that mix really evolved between some of your more commodity products on the sell side and the value-added, some other pieces in there? Jim Snee : I mean we\u2019ve said for some time in refrigerated foods, the focus on the long term trend really is for growing our value-added sales. And we know that there's going to be some short term noise with changes in markets and commodity profits. And I think we\u2019re still seeing that play out. Some of the new capacity has come online much slower than announced. But we\u2019re still worried about controlling what we can control, and really that's driving our value-added business. And we\u2019re doing that with Natural Choice, Bacon 1, the strategic acquisition of Columbus, which is doing very well. And that's the refrigerated food story going forward. And so we\u2019re pleased with that business. We are and we did say that the volume growth was driven by those acquisitions. And so we\u2019re pleased that those strategies are playing out as well. Adam Samuelson : And then on the acquisitions, I mean, can you talk about how they were doing themselves organically between Columbus and Fontanini. And as we think about just where those have been performing? Jim Snee : I would tell you that both of those are meeting our expectations, and both of them are showing growth year-over-year. They\u2019re in different stages of the integration process. Fontanini, we\u2019ve got the operations piece integrated, and we\u2019re ahead on the sales and marketing integration in the food service. From a Columbus perspective, we are starting the systems and operations integration here the next several weeks. And then the sales and marketing integration is a work in process but that will be up and running for fiscal 2019. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Farha Aslam of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Farha Aslam : My first question is really focused on a broader pricing question, I mean, as you look to cross the various parts of your business. How successful have you been in terms of implementing pricing for freight, packaging and commodity? And could you share with us your ability to price in the current market environment to protect margins? Jim Snee : Just as a reminder, there\u2019re different ways that we price in both the food service and retail channel; in our food service business, we probably are on 30 day lag; on the retail side of the business, probably more like 60 days. And we feel like we are still in a very strong position to be able to take pricing when appropriate. And we think what happened to our business towards the tail end of last year really supports that position. If you think about how we were faced with significant input cost increases, in six of our seven largest inputs, we took pricing on Wholly Guacamole, SKIPPY, chili, stew, hash. And it\u2019s not easy but we were able to get that pricing through. So it's not easy but it certainly is achievable. And then I think you can see how that plays out as we wrap up the second quarter, some of the items that we\u2019re talking about that showed growth were Wholly, chili, stew, and hash. So we believe that we have the appropriate pricing power when necessary. On the freight side of the business, wouldn't say that we\u2019ve recaptured all the freight costs. But I think the fact that we\u2019re going at it in a myriad of different ways is the right way to do it. Farha Aslam : And then a very specific question. Could you address the contract manufacturing? Is that declined simply your purposeful exit of lower margin business? Is that something that will continue to be a factor for Hormel, or is this contained in the current quarter? Jim Snee : Well, our contract manufacturing business is -- it\u2019s not a strategic play for us. It is and I think we\u2019ve been pretty open about it. It is more of a capacity play for us. And I think we all see what\u2019s happening in the contract manufacturing environment. It\u2019s a tough competitive environment. We experienced that this quarter. And we know that it's going to continue to be a challenge. Our goal in all of it is we want to fill up our capacity with our value added sales, and that\u2019s our number one goal. So it has an impact this quarter, and we do see it ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year. Farha Aslam : So not a significant factor longer term? Jim Snee : I am sorry? Farha Aslam : So not a significant factor longer term, it\u2019s a quarter specific issue? Jim Snee : More of a quarter specific issue, we do see it adding ebb and flow over time. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Your line is open, please go ahead. Heather Jones : I was wondering, did I hear you say that you expect deli prices to flat year-on-year, flattish year-on-year for the second half? Jim Sheehan : That\u2019s correct, Heather. Heather Jones : And just for this last year, the second half, you had -- not you, but the deli pricing in general was up dramatically, and inventories are much higher this year. Just curious as to why you all are expecting that? Jim Sheehan : It\u2019s an average. We\u2019ve see a lot of volatility in the deli prices and on average, we see them relatively flat to last year. They are lower right now than last year. So again, these are all markets that have been very volatile that's our best estimate at this time. Heather Jones : And on your food service side, you mentioned a 30 day lag. And from what I understand, and if I\u2019m misunderstanding please correct me, before I understand, those tend to be cost pass through. But on the retail side, pricing is sticker on the way up and the way down. But I was wondering, given the environment out there on the consumer side. What have you been experiencing thus far and the ability to keep pricing at the retail level, given some pull back and some of the input cost you mention, like trim and deli and avocados? And have you so far this quarter, and all of you\u2019ve experiencing success with keeping pricing in place? Jim Snee : Heather, on the food service side of the business, I think you talk about it being a cost pass through, and we do see some of that. But I would tell you in our food service business, we really believe we have some stickiness in the pricing as well. On the retail side of the business, we have been able to hold on to the price increases that we saw at the end of last year. And then also, we've seen strong volume growth in many of those brands that we took pricing on. So the Wholly Guacamol, chilis, stew, has items, we have retained pricing and we\u2019ve seen some nice volume growth. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from the Eric Larson of the Buckingham Research Group. Your line is open, please go ahead. Eric Larson : Just a question on the turkey side of the business, again. I think you dialed up your -- last year you took your advertising off of Jennie-O and some of the major programs. And I think you\u2019ve now reinstated that and that what we\u2019re going to -- again negatively impact to your second, your two --. What do we need to see -- we saw cold storage come down for turkey in most recent months that just came out. And what do -- is it just cutting back of supplies here again Jim that we still need to see and maybe fewer pull placements? What is it that\u2019s gets this extended lot longer than we\u2019ve thought declined in the Turkey business back on track? Jim Sheehan : Eric I would look for a couple of things. We\u2019re seeing of the harvest level go down 3% as we talked about, that's a good indicator. The pull placements, if I were to give you a number, it\u2019d probably be 5% to see a 5% decline in pull placements would tell us that we\u2019re getting there. Breast meats, in general on a $2 breast meat, the market becomes healthy again. What\u2019s the real drag now is this whole bird situation, which whole bird inventory is still up 14%, the market I think is at $0.87 right now, $0.84 somewhere in there. And that pricing is going to drag on until the first quarter. So we certainly see some good indications that things are turning the right direction. Jim Snee : And Eric you're also correct. I mean we are going to be back with our very successful Make the Switch campaign. We know and we've seeing the results that can deliver. And we are focused on the value-added portfolio at Jennie-O with our lean ground turkey Oven Ready product. So all of things, in concert, is really what lead us to have our view that we\u2019ll see growth in the first half of 2019. Eric Larson : And then just another follow up, I know you touched base on already. I guess, the issue with CytoSport that you said it's a competitive issue again. And I guess what surprised me was that it was just -- it seemed like, like your first quarter, you really did have maybe some improvement in that whole dynamic. And it just seemed to reverse very quickly and oddly again. Is it a particular one player out there that's doing this? I mean, I guess we're -- I'm lacking the seed just going on there. Jim Snee : There is one very aggressive competitor in the marketplace. In the category itself, I mean, we saw -- the most recent report, we saw some share growth. But we saw a sales decline, because we had to be very aggressive and take on that competitive activity. And so I mean you're right. In the first quarter, we did feel like maybe we'd turned the corner, but the second quarter did not continue that trend. And we know that we still have to work to get our distribution line. We've got a great distribution partner with Pepsi, but we haven't solved it yet. And so we are working on a lot of fronts in terms of distribution, messaging, pricing, branding. It's all hands on deck and we do believe the transition from specialty and grocery products will help over the long-term. Eric Larson : Okay, thanks. I know there\u2019s other questions so I'll get back in the queue. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, please go ahead. Robert Moskow : A handful of questions here, you mentioned the price increases on stews, Wholly Guacamole and SKIPPY. But for your grocery products pricing in the quarter, unless I'm doing the math wrong, was it down organically? Jim Sheehan : Yes, it was, Rob. It was mainly driven by CytoSport. So remember, we've got the consolidation of specialty foods, which is now CytoSport and also grocery products. Robert Moskow : So ex that, do you think your pricing was up in like your traditional retail grocery division? Jim Sheehan : That's correct, Rob. I would say our grocery products core was up low single digits in sales. Robert Moskow : In sales, okay. But pricing unclear\u2026 Jim Sheehan : And pricing, yes. Exactly, yes. Robert Moskow : And then you do have some steel can cost exposure. I was trying to do some math in my earnings preview. Can you give us a sense of when that will start to flow through, and whether you would need more pricing again? Jim Sheehan : For the steel impact on our business, it runs probably 1% to 2% of our cost of goods. We have not seen a pricing impact. We don't expect to see pricing impact for the balance of this year. And at this point, it\u2019s looks like it\u2019s going to be on product coming from China. Our supply chain is not dependent on the product coming from China. The soonest that we would see increases, just on a regular increased basis, would be in calendar 2019. Robert Moskow : And a different just a question, seed cost for turkey. I thought those seed costs would start to raise -- ride higher -- that doesn\u2019t appear to be in your outlook though? Jim Sheehan : No, we have higher seed cost in the second half. We\u2019ve seen some volatile pricing because of the weather in South America strong demand. There has been delayed planting in the U.S., so the main driver is higher soybean deal. And we are hedged for half two and some of 2019 between 25% and 75% through derivatives and forward purchases. Robert Moskow : And then last versus last question. One of your protein competitors was talking about a slow start to the grilling season this year, because of cold weather in April. Has that impacted your business at all? And do you think this was a one month thing and it comes right back again? Jim Snee : We haven\u2019t seen that kind of impact, Rob. Our value-added business in our refrigerated foods segment continues to be healthy. And I mean, one of our impact there might be, I would suspect, that it is a short-term impact and then it comes back. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Benjamin Theurer of Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Just a quick question. Basically following up on what you've laid out about a year ago with your priorities. And one of that was that you\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019re considering divesting non-strategic assets. Now, taking a look at the performance at the CytoSport, I mean, you\u2019ve for sure got the question in the past. But just considering the ongoing challenges in sales, it\u2019s basically dilutive in a certain degree to the category here. Is that something which is on the table and under discussion to get potentially sold at some stage if you're not going to be able to turn the business around? What's your take on that more from a medium-term strategic approach on that business? Jim Snee : The finest pork business is on trend, it\u2019s a great addition to our portfolio and we still like the business. Have we had some headwinds and challenges? Some in our control, some outside control absolutely. I think, from a more holistic approach, I mean we are still committed to reviewing our entire portfolio and making sure that it's a good healthy strategic review. And for those businesses that no longer make sense, we will take the appropriate action. So we haven\u2019t backed off that strategic perspective. But I would say at this point CytoSPort is still very positive business, very on trend and a great addition to our portfolio. Benjamin Theurer : And then on the second topic, actually goes into the same direction more of that medium term strategic outlook on -- if you have any update on your planning for the supply chain modernization? What\u2019s focus next steps? And where do you think challenges might arise over the coming quarters on that integration target? Jim Snee : So as I said, we had Glenn Leitch in a role now for about four months and he has been busy with a number of different initiatives, getting into operational consistency across all of our facilities as we break down the different silos going from a business unit approach to one global supply chain, looking at labor utilization, efficiencies. We\u2019ve got a very broad co-packer network and looking for opportunities for improvement there. Freight, obviously, has been probably a disproportionate amount of the time that they\u2019re working on. As we again work on minimizing miles, maximizing weight and working with our customers. He is also looking at ways to mitigate moderate volatility throughout the supply chain. Inventory management is a key focus. So there certainly are a number of things that he's working on. And for us, the base thing is that they\u2019re finding and going to continue to find efficiencies that we wouldn't have found without having this one supply chain across our organization. Benjamin Theurer : And if you then -- you\u2019ve just mentioned it that would be just in regards to that. What were issues? Why, what -- you mentioned that inventories went up, so that was basically because of the acquisitions and it\u2019s just not optimized yet at the acquired assets? Or is there some sourcing issues, and then you have to work with longer inventories? So just to get an idea, because you\u2019ve mentioned in cash conversion cycles a focus, and obviously inventory is an important part here. So just to understand what drove the increase in inventory, aside from the acquisition -- the issues on acquisition asset level, that's basically the question? Jim Snee : The main driver was the acquisition of the businesses. We've taken three days out of our past cycle. We identified that as one of our priorities. So we've been very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on the number of days of inventory we\u2019re holding, turning our receivables quicker, and also taking advantage of our ability to manage our accounts payable better. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we've made on the improvement in the cash conversion cycle. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll now take a follow-up question from Ms. Heather Jones of The Vertical Group. Your line is open, please go ahead. Heather Jones : Just had a quick question on turkey. So you mentioned whole bird and those inventories are relatively heavy. On the value added side, the strength you\u2019ve had in oven and ground turkey. Are you starting to see a return in profitability in that piece of the business close to what we had pre-AI before all distortion of AI and all? Are margins there getting close to what they were historically, and it\u2019s just the whole bird piece that\u2019s weighing things down? Jim Snee : So we expect to see margin improvement on the value-added business as we continue to move through the cycle. I mean, it is what you said. I mean, the whole bird impact right now is really is weighing the business down. Operator : Thank you. We will now take a follow up question from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Two questions, one is on the -- you discussed the turkey outlook for 2019 a little bit. Can you frame the other businesses and how you think about it? And I think last quarter you guys implied that you guys would be largely back or approaching your long-term growth rate. Is that still a fair assumption? Is there anything that changed in your outlook for 2019? Jim Sheehan : As we think about 2019, Ken, we always tell you we haven\u2019t started the formal process yet. But we\u2019re still very optimistic about the earnings power that we feel like we've created through the strategic acquisitions, the CapEx investment that we\u2019re making and the focus on those strategic imperatives. For refrigerated foods, continued strong fundamentals and growing our value-added sales, both in retail and food service. The impact of the new deli group, as a growth vehicle for refrigerated foods, will play a positive role. In grocery products, we expect continued momentum in the core grocery products portfolio, and we\u2019re going to continue to be working to get CytoSport back on track in that GP model also. JOTS is going to be an ongoing recovery in turkey, and then our lean ground turkey, our Oven Ready products, the whole value added initiative. So we do see that return to growth in 2019. And I'm still very optimistic about our international business. The new plant in China is adding the much-needed capacity. The business is healthy. Our branded exports are very strong. The addition of Ceratti in Brazil is going well with good volume growth. So we\u2019re optimistic about the business going forward as we head into 2019. Ken Zaslow : And the acquisitions, can you remind us how much accretion there would be from each of them? I think you said one but not both of them. Can you just talk about the accretion contribution in 2019 from both of them? Jim Sheehan : We\u2019ve said Columbus was going to be accretive by $0.02 in 2018 and Fontanini -- Ceratti was going to be basically $0.01\u2026 Ken Zaslow : And it was up 2019, I thought there was a nickel from\u2026 Jim Sheehan : 2019 Columbus will be accretive $0.06 to $0.08 and Ceratti will -- we haven\u2019t really said anything yet. Ken Zaslow : Is there a reason that wouldn\u2019t be accretive by the nickel region, is that a fair parameter to start with? Jim Sheehan : We\u2019re still evaluating the business, it will be accretive. We haven\u2019t identified what the final accretion will be. Operator : Thank you. We will now take a follow-up question from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, please go ahead. Robert Moskow : So operating profit -- in refrigerated, acquisitions added 13% to the quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much profit it added, was it close to 13% as well? Jim Sheehan : Well, I mean, obviously, it had a very positive impact on the business, both Columbus and the Fontanini. So I mean, still a very positive impact for refrigerated. Refrigerated was up without them but it did have a -- it was an addition. Robert Moskow : And then just the last one. I think you and Jim have been very cautious in your commentary about what savings to expect from this supply chain consolidation, and you've mentioned efficiencies. But the word reinvestment keeps popping up. Are you finding that as you dig deeper into the supply chain that there is a lot of need for reinvestment in labor, logistics and things like that? Jim Snee : From our perspective, the areas that are going to need investment is, automation clearly, is one of them. And as we think about what's happening with the labor force, going forward, we're just -- it's an issue we're going to have to deal with, and automation will be an area that can help us. From a distribution perspective, I do think that we're going to have to continue to evaluate our distribution structure as we have changes into the business with some of these acquisitions and where it may be, where their supply chains are located. But a lot of that is just normal course of business. We don't see a significant change to our maintenance CapEx level. We see our investments really coming -- continuing to come to drive our value-added capacity needs. But the supply chain is doing some great work to make sure that we're properly aligned for the future. Operator : Thank you. It appears there are no further questions, at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased with the record earnings announced, and I'm confident in our strategic priorities and our direction, as well as our ability to continue to proactively manage the challenges facing us for the balance of this year. We have an experienced and talented team in place that will allow us to overcome these challenges, deliver our key results and continue to drive growth for our shareholders. Have a safe Memorial Day weekend. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Please note during our call today, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic net sales and organic volume.  I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. We are pleased to report our team delivered record sales and earnings in the third quarter. Our company\u2019s long-term growth formula is anchored in building brands, innovation, strategic acquisitions, and achieving balance across our portfolio. We take a consistent, long-term approach to our business decisions and strategy. Over the years, we have increased marketing investments in support of our brands. I am pleased to report those investments are paying off with growth both from established brands such as Spam and Skippy, and with emerging brands such as Natural Choice, Applegate, Jennie-O, Holy Guacamole, and Herdez. We are also delivering innovation to the marketplace at a faster cadence than ever before. Food service innovations such as Bacon 1, Fire Braised Meats, and Austin Blues continues to generate growth. Retail innovations like Skippy, PB Bites, Herdez Guacamole Salsa, and Natural Choice snacks are also making meaningful contributions to our results. Our recent disciplined and strategic acquisitions expand our presence in areas where we are a market leader, such as deli and food service. While it is early, I\u2019m happy to report the Fontanini, Columbus and Ceratti acquisitions are meeting our expectations.  The final component of our long term formula is balance. This is why we made the decision last week to divest the Fremont harvest facility, which when complete will decrease our earnings volatility. Our long term strategy is sound and our experienced leadership team is executing this strategy.  We achieved record sales and earnings in the third quarter as we managed through foreign trade uncertainty, increased freight costs and commodity market volatility. We generated record earnings per share of $0.39, up 15% from last year. The benefit from tax reform also contributed to our record results. Record third quarter sales were up 7% on a 5% volume increase. The increases were driven by the recent strategic additions of Ceratti, Columbus Craft Meats, and Fontanini, as well as growth from many of our brands across our entire organization. On an organic basis, volume was up 1% while sales were flat. Strength in key brands across our portfolio were offset by lower pork and turkey markets, which drove decreased pricing for the quarter. Third party consumption data continues to show growth across our portfolio in both center store and the perimeter of the store. We are pleased to see growth in household penetration this quarter from emerging brands such as Herdez, Natural Choice, and Jennie-O, and also from established brands such as Spam, Skippy, and Dinty Moore.  Grocery products had a solid quarter. We are pleased with the continued growth from our core grocery products portfolio as that team grew sales mid single digits. Brands such as Skippy, Hormel chili, Holy Guacamole and Herdez all delivered excellent sales growth this quarter. Total grocery product sales were flat due to declines in CytoSport and our contract manufacturing business. Earnings grew 4% as our core grocery products portfolio continued to deliver excellent results and were able to offset declines in contract manufacturing, increased advertising investments, and increased freight costs. The team at CytoSport continues to work on improving their business results. While volume and sales declined, earnings grew for the quarter due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Our international segment delivered sales growth of 11% on a volume increase of 9%. Sales increased on stronger exports of Spam luncheon meat and Skippy peanut butter, favorable results in China, and the addition of the Ceratti business in Brazil. We continue to gain momentum in China as we grow distribution for our Spam family of products. International segment profit increased 9% despite lower fresh pork export earnings, higher advertising investments and increased freight costs.  Refrigerated foods grew volume 5% and sales 10%. In addition to strong value-added sales growth, the inclusion of the Fontanini and Columbus acquisitions also contributed to improved sales. A reduction in hog harvest volume of 4% drove an organic volume decline of 2% and an organic sales decline of 3%. Pricing declined due to lower pork markets year over year. We continue to grow our branded value-added volume and sales in the retail, food service and deli channels. Brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised Meats, Caf\u00e9 H, and Natural Choice all showed strong sales growth in the food service channel. We have also successfully launched the Applegate brand into the food service channel as we work to introduce this leading brand to operators around the country. The Natural Choice and Applegate brands also generated excellent sales growth in the retail channel as consumers continue to search for brands that align with their lifestyles. On a segment profit basis, refrigerated foods value-added increases were able to offset a dramatic decline in commodity pork profits, higher freight costs, and higher advertising investments. Commodity profits were down 88% to near breakeven levels. This accomplishment speaks to the team\u2019s ability to deliver results and to the long-term strategy of moving the portfolio away from commodity business toward branded value-added products. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered strong volume growth of 14% and sales growth of 8%. Our three value-added businesses all grew volume and sales this quarter. Value-added sales growth was led by Jennie-O lean ground turkey, Jennie-O premium deli items, and the Jennie-O oven-ready products. Sales also increased due to earlier shipments of whole birds to minimize cold storage expenses. Segment profit declined 23% due to lower whole bird and commodity prices.  As we look to our fourth quarter, we expect to remain on track with our previous earnings guidance. We expect a strong finish to the year from refrigerated foods as they continue to grow value-added sales and profits while managing through commodity volatility. We anticipate the international segment to generate earnings growth in the fourth quarter given the positive momentum that team has with branded exports and improving business results in China. We do see risk from tariffs which could negatively impact fresh pork exports and the segment\u2019s results. We anticipate a slight decline in earnings for grocery products. We expect to generate ongoing growth in the core center store portfolio while managing through continued declines in contract manufacturing.  For Jennie-O Turkey Store, we still expect earnings to decline in the fourth quarter compared to last year. We see fundamentals slowly improving and are encouraged by trends in the turkey breast meat market. We will not lap the declines in the whole bird business until calendar 2019 but expect our successful Make the Switch campaign to drive branded sales growth, including our lean ground turkey product line.  We continue to see double digit increases in per-unit freight costs. Our efforts to find mutually agreeable solutions with our customers are helping to offset a portion of this increase.  Taking all these factors into account, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $1.81 to $1.95 per share. We have lowered our sales guidance to $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion from $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion due to lower pork commodity markets.  Last week, we announced an agreement to sell the Fremont processing facility to WholeStone Farms. This was not an easy decision. The Fremont facility has been an important part of our company for decades and we are pleased to have found a home for this team and facility with WholeStone Farms. Fremont is a single shift operation. Given the changes in the pork industry, the facility will need additional investments to keep it competitive. I\u2019m pleased to see that WholeStone Farms has committed to modernize the facility. This strategic decision right-sizes our pork supply chain, reduces our earnings volatility, and is aligned with our vision as a global branded food company.  At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2018, and financial and operational details of the Fremont transaction. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we increased our investment into our business in the form of advertising, capital expenditures for our value-added products, and a universal stock option grant for 20,000 employees. The third quarter marked the completion of 90 consecutive years of quarterly dividends.  Our financial strategy and capital allocation decisions support the long term growth strategy that Jim discussed. Volume for the third quarter was 1.2 billion pounds, a 5% increase compared to last year. We generated record sales for the third quarter of $2.4 billion, a 7% increase. Net earnings were $210 million, up 15% compared to last year. For the quarter, SG&A expenses excluding advertising were 7.2% of sales compared to 6.9% last year. The impact of acquisitions drove the increase. Advertising investment was $40 million compared to $44 million last year. We are currently advertising key growth brands, including Skippy, Spam, Jennie-O, and Natural Choice. General corporate expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including the $4 million expense related to universal stock options. Expenses also increased $2 million due to tax-related services.  Operating margins were 11.1%, a 160 basis point decrease compared to last year. The decline is primarily a result of lower margins at Jennie-O and higher freight across the entire business. Our effective tax rate was 18.4% compared to 34.3% last year. We engaged a third party to review our deferred tax liabilities in light of changes from tax reform. As a result of this study, the quarter reflects reduced taxes of $8 million. A $2 million expense was recorded in general corporate to complete this study. Considering this event, we now estimate our full-year effective tax rate will be between 15% and 16%. This implies a fourth quarter tax rate between 21% and 24%. Year-to-date, we have generated operating cash flows of $743 million, up 40%. The increase was related to higher earnings and improved working capital. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $42 million last year as we continued to invest in new production facilities and manufacturing capacity for our value-added businesses. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million in 2018. In the quarter, we paid $99 million of dividends at the annual rate of $0.75 per share. This marked our 360th consecutive quarterly dividend.  Total debt is $720 million. This is split between long term and short term debt. We remain in a strong financial position to fund other investments. We did not repurchase any stock this quarter.  We continue to focus on three factors in the hog industry : export demand, domestic demand, and industry capacity utilization. Exports remain uncertain, impacted by multiple rounds of tariffs and recent animal health issues in China. The USDA forecast export volume to be up 6% in 2018. Domestic consumption remains very high; however, pork pricing has come down since last year as the USDA Composite value was 16% below year-ago levels in the third quarter. We expect hog supplies to increase 3% to 4% this year and expect continued hog supply growth into 2019.  The sale of the Fremont facility is the culmination of a multi-year assessment of the pork industry as well as a detailed review of the capital required to modernize the Fremont facility. We concluded that running Fremont as a single shift operation was not a viable option and we would have to either spend the capital to modernize the facility, find a long-term supply partner, or close the facility over time. We began discussions with WholeStone Farms after learning of their interest to enter the hog processing business. Our discussions resulted in the sale of the facility at terms that provide benefits to both parties. The purchase price of the transaction is $30 million and includes the Fremont processing facility and a multi-year agreement to provide pork and raw materials from the first shift of production at market-based prices.  The sale of the Fremont facility allows us to do a number of things. First, this transaction allows us to contractually secure a source of raw material for our value-added business at competitive market prices. Second, this deal reduces the number of hogs we purchase and related exposure to volatility in the hog markets. Finally, the sale of the plant allows us to avoid significant capital to modernize the facility. For example, we recently invested $80 million to modernize the Austin facility. A similar investment would be required for Fremont in addition to investments to double shift the facility.  We expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of expenses associated with this sale in fiscal 2019. These expenses include the cost to move value-added equipment out of the facility and various pension-related expenses. Fremont Harvest\u2019s 10, 500 hogs per day currently represents one-third of our harvest volume and less than one-third of refrigerated foods commodity pork earnings. We will provide further guidance on the impact to fiscal 2019 on our fourth quarter earnings call. Input costs for the third quarter were generally lower. Hog prices were 10% lower than last year. We expect hog prices to be lower than last in the fourth quarter. Belly prices were 20% lower than last year. We expect belly prices to remain volatile and below year-ago levels. Seventy-two percent pork trim prices were 22% below last year. We expect trim markets to be modestly lower than 2017 levels. As we look into the first half of fiscal 2019, we see flat to lower hog, belly and trim prices. We do expect volatility as new harvest plants and hog supplies come online. Fifty percent beef trim was 43% lower compared to last year. We expect beef trim prices to be similar to 2017 levels. Market costs for feed were higher compared to last year. We expect feed costs to be higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  We continue to see signs of a slow recovery in the turkey industry. Full placements have shown low single digit declines in recent months which indicates lower harvest levels in the coming quarters. Turkey pressed meat and whole birds in cold storage are still well above long term average levels. Breast meat prices increased during the quarter. Breast meat averaged $1.88 per pound compared to $1.53 last year. We expect moderate increases in the coming quarters. Whole bird prices are 17% lower than 2017 levels, and we do not expect a material change in pricing until the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Various market factors, including tariffs, freight, supply levels and demand have all created market volatility, yet we have demonstrated an ability to manage through this volatility and deliver long term value for our shareholders.  At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our first question is coming from Akshay Jagdale from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Akshay Jagdale : Hi, good morning. I wanted to get a sense on Jennie-O turkey profitability and how you see it. What\u2019s the long term bridge to a more sustainable and higher level? If we have low breast meat prices which seem to be moving off a bottom and then you\u2019ve got a bunch of higher costs, maybe you can help us just think through high level, long term how we\u2019re going to regain profitability levels that we\u2019ve seen in this business historically. Thank you. Jim Snee : Good morning. The JOTS business, we still remain very pleased with that business, very pleased with the value-added growth that we\u2019re seeing, just like we did this most recent quarter. Over time certainly we need to make sure that the supply comes in balance in the marketplace. We\u2019ve talked a lot about lower poult placements, we\u2019ve talked a lot about the need for reduced inventory in cold storage, and although we\u2019re seeing those trends, they\u2019re happening slower than we have expected. You\u2019re correct - we are seeing higher breast meat pricing, we\u2019re seeing a stabilized whole bird market which are very positive for the fundamentals of the business, but over the long term for us, it\u2019s really about our ability to continue to grow the value-added business, and we believe the results that we\u2019ve delivered in the third quarter are a very good indication that the business is healthy and will return to growth in 2019. Akshay Jagdale : That\u2019s helpful. One follow-up, I guess, would be on the refrigerated foods business. Obviously the value-added business is doing exceptionally well in offsetting some of the weakness in the commodity markets. I know you gave a lot of information so we\u2019ll have some time to digest it afterwards, but can you help us understand where you think the commodity margins are? Have they bottomed out, or do you think things might get a little bit worse before they get better as it relates to industry capacity utilization rates? Thank you. Jim Snee : That\u2019s a number that\u2019s very, very hard to predict. Clearly we\u2019re dealing with a lot of projections that remain uncertain and volatile. There have been a number of announcements in terms of increased hog processing capacity, but in terms of what happens with the timing of that, that will feed into projections and into that volatility, so at this point it\u2019s really hard to say. Akshay Jagdale : Okay, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ken Zaslow : Good morning everyone. Jim Snee : Morning Ken. Ken Zaslow : Two questions. Will you be able to grow EBITDA in 2019? Jim Snee : We\u2019re in the midst of a planning process for \u201919, and our early look into fiscal \u201919 shows pre-tax growth. Obviously we\u2019ll have more precise guidance for everyone on our November call, but as we think about all the different businesses, with refrigerated foods we expect to see continued value-added growth, we\u2019ll have our deli division fully up and running, impact of the recent acquisitions, and clearly we\u2019ll have the impact of the Fremont sale that we\u2019ll talk to you more about on the fourth quarter call as well. Our GP business, the core business remains very, very strong. We\u2019re seeing growth from Mega Mix, steady growth from Nutbutters on the core business but also on the innovation front, the pipeline is very robust. We have work to do to continue to stabilize CytoSport and contract manufacturing in that portfolio, but we think the outlook is very positive. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the JOTS business, the slowly improving fundamentals, the growth in value-added, especially lean ground; and in our international business, we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in China. We know that we have some volatility in the fresh pork exports due to tariffs. So our early look into \u201919, Ken, shows pre-tax growth and we know that there is certainly headwinds out there and unknowns in terms of the tariffs, and we\u2019re going to battle through that; but yes, we do think we can grow pre-tax earnings in 2019. Ken Zaslow : Great, and my follow-up question, just as a nuance, is in the quarter, how much was freight and the higher hog, higher deli prices relative to lower [pork] [ph] packing margins? Can you give some sort of relative so we can understand the importance of different factors in the quarter? I\u2019ll leave it there. Ken Sheehan : Sure. On a freight basis, it\u2019s still been a headwind in the quarter, and we expect it to be a headwind in 2019. We\u2019ve said again we\u2019re focused on finding the most mutually agreeable solutions in terms of minimizing miles, maximizing weight, less internal freight, and we\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve offset a majority of the cost increase on go-forward basis. Nathan, you can have a follow-up conversation perhaps on the quarter, but really of the full year, our freight costs are expected to be up $0.06 to $0.08 on an EPS basis for the full year. Ken Zaslow : Great. Thank you very much. Ken Sheehan : Thanks Ken. Operator : The next question is coming from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Yes, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on Fremont, and I\u2019m kind of inferring that this is what your contractual obligations are going--what your supply contract is going forward. Are you obligated--are you contracting to take all of the output from Fremont going forward, or just the needs that you have? In other words, are you moving away from some of the commodity oriented products that would normally be produced, and you will not have an obligation to sell that? Jim Snee : Eric, in the short term, it\u2019s going to be essentially business as usual. We\u2019re contracted to take all of the meat just like we do today for the first three years, and then over time we\u2019ll have the opportunity to evaluate the business and make those decisions. But in that first three years, we are taking all of the meat off of the first shift just like we do today. Eric Larson : Yes, okay, and that makes sense. I assumed that that probably was the case. Maybe this is for Jim Sheehan. Jim, I probably should know the answer to this because it\u2019s been a big delta for the whole year, but your general corporate expenses were up, it was a big delta in the quarter year-over-year. Can you explain what that is? You didn\u2019t highlight any one-time items that were in there. Can you just refresh us why your corporate expense is up so much in the quarter and for the full year? Jim Sheehan : Certainly. First of all, we talked about the universal stock options. The universal stock options were issued in the third quarter, and that created a $4 million corporate expense. The other issue that we referenced was the tax study that we did. The tax study reduced our taxes in the third quarter by $8 million. There was a $2 million fee that exists within the corporate expense for that, and then we had generally higher employee expenses in the quarter. Eric Larson : Okay, thank you, I appreciate it. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question is coming from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On your EPS guidance for the full year, it\u2019s still a pretty big range, so I was curious what are the key factors driving that larger range. Any sense at this point whether you\u2019re trending towards a bottom or higher end of that range? Jim Snee : Good morning, Rupesh. Given what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, we\u2019re talking a lot obviously about the volatility, whether it\u2019s tariffs, market conditions. We felt it was appropriate to keep the range intact for the full year, obviously reaffirming that guidance. As we think about some of the things that could take you either way, on the high end if we see continued declines in input costs, if there is a sudden end to tariffs, if there is a rapid recovery in turkey. On the lower end, the flipside or the inverse would be true - if we see a spike in input costs when you think about hogs, bellies, trim, grain, or if the tariff situation worsens. But we believe that the midpoint is still very reasonable, and we thought it was very appropriate to keep the range where it is. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great, and then my follow-up question on tariffs. I know there is a lot of different tariffs out there and, I think, some proposals out there, so I was curious if you can just help us understand the dynamics currently, and then what is assumed in your current guidance? Jim Snee : Sure. Obviously it\u2019s difficult since we\u2019re dealing with markets. For the back half of the year, it\u2019s about $0.01 to $0.02, primarily coming from our export business, our fresh pork exports. As we think about it on an annual basis, probably about $0.04 to $0.06, but clearly there is a lot of uncertainty. As you think across our business, the impact would be pork, steel, aluminum, but the majority of that really is being export related. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from Michael Lavery from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thanks, good morning. Could you just give an update on some of your supply chain reconfiguration? I don\u2019t remember you mentioning that as a driver of \u201919 earnings growth. What do you expect for some of the savings opportunity, what\u2019s some of the timing? Can you just give us some more color on where that all stands? Jim Snee : Sure, good morning. We\u2019ve put our supply chain in place earlier this year, led by Glenn Leitch, and we have kept Glenn and his team incredibly busy since that time, obviously dealing with all of the freight issues in the industry, evaluating our total supply chain. He was really the point person for the Fremont transaction, and we have got a lot accomplished in 2018, doing a lot of work around in-sourcing production, asset utilization, some automation, efficiency projects, and then we can\u2019t forget the fact that we\u2019re in the midst of building a new facility in Melrose for our Jennie-O Turkey Store business, and then a significant expansion for our value-added capacity down in Dold. We have kept that team busy. We are working for a perspective on 2019 and we\u2019ll be able to provide you more detail on that in our fourth quarter call. Michael Lavery : Is it right to assume some of the freight efficiencies you\u2019re looking for are all integral to that work? Just related to freight, when you talk about some of that headwind continuing into next year, is that all on rates that--are you still seeing those going higher? Jim Snee : I think it\u2019s a combination of things. I mean, you\u2019re going to have--who knows what\u2019s going to happen with fuel prices. Certainly the shortage of drivers can impact rates. What we\u2019re really focused on are the things that we can control, and I mentioned it\u2019s the minimizing miles, maximizing freight, and really making sure that we\u2019re doing the right things on an internal basis so that we can offset as much of that as possible. But we feel really good about the work that\u2019s been done. Michael Lavery : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : The next question is coming from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Jeremy Scott : Hey, good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the Fremont sale. I guess it\u2019s one third of processing, less than one third of commodity sales, so that would imply that the value-add mix is somewhat higher than Austin. Maybe you can elaborate on what you meant by that. Then on the multi-purchase agreement, just the answer to the prior question on taking all the meat, so it sounds like your overall volume is not going to be impacted because you said it\u2019s business as usual; however I guess I\u2019m a little bit confused as to what the margin structure on that looks like. Presumably there\u2019s commodity product that you\u2019re going to be buying and then reselling without a value-add component, is that right? Jim Snee : That is correct. If you think about the transaction, what we are losing is the spread between the hog cost and the USDA composite value. That\u2019s how I would look at it. Jeremy Scott : Okay, so that\u2019s a pretty good margin today, but if you were to buy ham and then resell ham, that margin would effectively go to zero, is that correct? Jim Snee : Well, you\u2019re correct that the margin is pretty good today, and what we\u2019ve talked about is that historically, it\u2019s less than 5% of refrigerated foods earnings, and in the current year, far less than that. We talked about a significant drop last quarter, about 25%, significant drop this quarter of 88%, and then really what the future holds in terms of how much comes online, what the timing is, it\u2019s all projections and it remains very uncertain and volatile. Jim Sheehan : Yes, so as we\u2019ve talked, we\u2019re giving up that spread, but the margins in retail, the margins in food service we\u2019ll still retain. We\u2019re taking out the volatility, and we still believe that this creates the right mix of internally sourced primals and outside purchased primals. It also allows us to avoid a very significant capital allocation. If you think about the Austin plant, that was over $80 million and did not include the cost to double shift this plant, so the capital investment into Fremont would have been very extensive. Jeremy Scott : Okay. The $30 million sale price, that\u2019s a good amount lower than what you were able to gain from Farmer John. I know it\u2019s an older plant and it needs some capital work, but would that imply a lower normalized margin than Farmer John, or is there something in the multi-year purchase agreement with WholeStone that we need to consider going forward, or is it just you said you\u2019re going to take the market price plus? What do we need to consider going forward as we\u2019re mapping this out? Jim Snee : I think the first thing is that you can\u2019t look at the purchase price in a vacuum. The first thing is Fremont was not a full business like Farmer John, and then the price does not include any of the value-added assets. We\u2019ve talked about some of the expenses that we\u2019ll have in 2019 as we relocate those assets, but the price does not include any of that because we will retain that.  As Jim mentioned, the facility really is in need of significant investment to remain competitive, and in fact it couldn\u2019t support both a double shift and value-added capacity, and so it does have the supply agreement at market-based prices, which we believe is a mutually beneficial agreement, and it\u2019s consistent with our long term strategy and we\u2019re excited. We really look forward to a long, successful partnership with WholeStone. Jeremy Scott : Got it. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue, thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe first question on refrigerated and the value-added side. The organic volumes in the quarter were down 2, you talked about harvest levels down 4, so can you talk about what the Ceratti and Columbus, or I guess Fontanini and Columbus organic volume growth were in the period? I know they\u2019re still in M&A, but just trying to think about what that organic volume growth looks like prospectively as you get those lapped into the base and you start comping some of those declines in harvest values that you\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters. Jim Snee : Adam, I think it\u2019s safe to say the value-added growth that we saw in the quarter was significant. I mean, to be able to offset that type of commodity profit decline of 88% tells a story of value-added growth. When you think about what\u2019s happening with Columbus, we\u2019re putting that deli sales division together to really leverage the strengths of the organization. The Columbus business remains very healthy and is going to be integral to the foundation of the deli division. The Fontanini business, also very healthy, and we\u2019re now able to really leverage what the acquisition thesis was in terms of taking our food service portfolio into the Fontanini organization and taking that Fontanini portfolio into the food service organization, so that we really can--you know, over time we know that we\u2019re going to see a sequential acceleration in that food service business.  I mean, we feel really good about what both of those businesses are bringing to the party, and they are going to play a key role as we continue to drive that value-added business over time. Jim Sheehan : I would add that we completed the integration of both Columbus and Fontanini. The other thing that we\u2019ve talked about is that volatility of the market can create some noise between quarters, and if you take a look at the belly market, the belly market\u2019s increased all during the third quarter and our pricing trails that increase. You saw a steep decline at the end of the third quarter in belly pricing, so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we feel that there will be a strong finish to refrigerated foods in Q4. Adam Samuelson : Okay, and then just going back on Fremont, just want to be clear on thinking about the sale price. So $30 million for the asset, you guys internally would think that there\u2019s at least $80 million of capital needed to go in, so effectively it\u2019s 110, some capital foregone that you don\u2019t have to spend, and from an earnings contribution at the plant, in the past you\u2019ve talked about commodity profits in refrigerated averaging about 15% of the segment, probably under that this year, and Fremont you talked about being less than a third of that. So the EBIT contribution of the plant, I\u2019d guess this year somewhere in the $10 million to $20 million range, is that a fair assessment, and then thinking about the sale price effectively is 110 because it\u2019s capital that you\u2019d otherwise have to spend? Jim Sheehan : Right. The commodity profits were down 88% in the third quarter, and we discussed that they were near breakeven levels. The fact that Fremont is a single shift plant, it\u2019s not as efficient as the Austin plant, which is a highly efficient double shift plant, that\u2019s why the profits are less than the volume at the plant. I would say that it\u2019s closer to $10 million a year than the numbers that you\u2019re throwing out. Adam Samuelson : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : The next question is coming from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. I guess a couple questions. One is on bacon pricing versus bellies, the spreads in the quarter. Were they favorable versus last year? I noticed that Bacon 1 was not mentioned in the press release as being a growth driver - that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen that in years. Bacon 1 has been a big driver of growth for you, so I just want to know what the spread was, whether it was good or bad. Then second, maybe if we could just take a step back at the big drivers for fiscal \u201919, the puts and takes. I imagine there\u2019s going to be the headwind from the costs to transition Fremont - you mentioned it here, $20 million or so. Maybe you could also help us on the commodity bridge to fiscal \u201919. Are you close to zero this year in commodity profits in pork, and therefore we don\u2019t have to think about another decline in fiscal \u201919 because if you\u2019re close to breakeven this year, we don\u2019t have to worry about a tough comp in fiscal \u201919 on the commodity side, or maybe we do? Can you help me with that? Jim Snee : Yes, good morning Rob. I\u2019ll take the bacon part and then we\u2019ll let Jim take the commodity part. The bacon dynamics, we had a solid quarter on retail bacon. It\u2019s obviously a very competitive category. I think the spreads have been positive, so really no issue there. In terms of the food service bacon dynamics, there was no fundamental reason why it was omitted. We\u2019ve seen strong demand for all of our bacon items, especially Bacon 1, so the bacon category is very healthy for us. We feel really good about where it\u2019s headed and are excited because we\u2019re in need of the capacity that\u2019s coming on line at our Dold facility. Very, very healthy bacon dynamics. Jim Sheehan : Yes, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the pork commodity. As we talked about last quarter, profits were down 25%; this quarter, they\u2019re down 88%, almost to near breakeven. As additional capacity comes online, and we\u2019ve talked about the additional capacity for a number of months now, knowing that WholeStone was also going to add additional capacity into this, it\u2019s likely that you will see lower pork margins going forward than what you\u2019ve seen historically. Historically, those margins have run about 15% of refrigerated foods, and that was all of the analysis that we made, lowering our harvest level, and sourcing the meat externally would be a favorable outcome. Jim Snee : Rob, I would add that we\u2019re still in Q4 and so it\u2019s hard to get a full year projection. We obviously saw a significant decline in Q2 and Q3, and the market is a little different in Q4. So again, we\u2019ll be able to give you some better visibility as we wrap up the year, but I think it just speaks volumes to the volatility that we\u2019ve been talking about over the last couple of years. Robert Moskow : Just to follow up, I think Jim, you talked about the outlook for \u201919, saying that you think you\u2019ll be driving some profitable growth in \u201919. I can see the logic, but the people I talk to are very worried about a protein glut overall in the market. The chicken companies are talking about it, there\u2019s too much beef on the market. Is it possible for your value-added business to benefit, I guess, from these lower input costs in this market? Is that what has to happen in order for profitable growth to occur in fiscal \u201919, or are you worried that with all this protein coming on, that even the value-added items might see some price pressure as well? Jim Snee : We think, Rob, that we would benefit obviously from lower input prices on our business. I think the other issue is really what happens on the tariff front, and so there\u2019s rumblings out there about some progress that is being made and if that comes to resolution, that could change the dynamics. But for us, I mean, we do certainly benefit from lower input costs across the portfolio. Robert Moskow : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Heather Jones from Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Thinking about your tax guidance, the review you did in the quarter, have you made any changes to where you think the \u201919 tax rate will shake out, or should we still be thinking somewhere in the low 20s? Jim Sheehan : Heather, I\u2019d think about 21.5% to 24.5%. Heather Jones : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, go ahead? Jim Sheehan : That\u2019s what we think Q4 will be, and we still think that we\u2019ll be in the low 20s in 2019, probably that same range in 2019. Heather Jones : Okay, and then I just wanted to go back to the Fremont. I\u2019m sort of curious, you said $10 million for that plant, so if I take how many hogs it was killing a day, it comes to about 2.5 million to 3 million hogs a year, assuming no Saturday kills. I was hoping you could give us a better understanding of what you all are defining as commodity, because that would equate to only about $3 a hog, $3 to $4 a hog, which I know you guys said it\u2019s not the most competitive plant, but that is well below--on an LTM basis, well below what we\u2019ve seen from others in the industry and well below industry margins. I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a sense of how you\u2019re defining commodity when you say that it\u2019s closer to the $10 million number. Jim Sheehan : We\u2019re defining the commodity as the spread, the pork profitability margin along with some profitability that would include our commodity sales into the excess market, is what I would refer to. Heather Jones : Commodity sales into the excess market is what you would call the commodity part? Jim Sheehan : Yes, the provision sales. Nathan can probably drill down into it deeper offline. Heather Jones : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is coming from Farha Aslam from Stephens. Please go ahead, your line is open. Farha Aslam : Hi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the tax question. What is the deferred taxes that you\u2019re including in your taxes for this year, the deferred tax revaluation benefit total overall? Jim Sheehan : Certainly. If you\u2019re talking about the change in the tax rate because of the study, what we did was to reassess our fixed assets to see if we could accelerate depreciation into the time period that had a higher statutory rate. Farha Aslam : Okay, but your revaluation of deferred assets, that was just completely in your first quarter and we didn\u2019t add to that this quarter. Jim Sheehan : Right, it\u2019s the--no, we reassessed that in the first quarter because the tax law took impact, had impact in the first quarter. You lower the amount that you can deduct in future years, but you reset that in the quarter. Your existing liability is reset at the time that the new tax rate is effective. Deferred tax is an ongoing change. Farha Aslam : Okay, so the tax benefit for this year, is that about $0.10? Jim Sheehan : It\u2019s about $65 million. Farha Aslam : About $65 million - okay, that\u2019s roughly around $0.10. Okay. Then my second question is really broader, on CytoSport. You highlighted that sales were down in the quarter, but earnings were actually up. Could you give us some color going into the fourth quarter and into 2019, how we should think about that business? Jim Snee : Farha, the team is hard at work at stabilizing that business. The big thing is what\u2019s happening in terms of the C-store market and the ready-to-drink space, and we need to gain back lost distribution. We\u2019ve talked about getting that consumer message right, and the team is working hard on that.  We also are pleased, though, with what\u2019s happening in really the food, drug and mass channel. Our take-home Tetra Pak drinks are growing really, really well, our innovation is doing well, and so we expect in 2019 that we\u2019ll see some stabilization in the business but there is still work to do around that brand. Farha Aslam : Okay, so we\u2019re not going to see the fourth quarter recovery, because I think we had previously anticipated top line growth in the fourth quarter because we\u2019re comping against a pretty easy comp. Jim Snee : Yes Farha, we were talking about earnings growth. We saw some of that in our third quarter, like we said, and we would expect to see that again in the fourth quarter. Farha Aslam : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our final question is a follow-up coming from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeremy Scott : Hey, thanks. I think that question was just answered, but the driver of grocery products margin decline in the fourth quarter, we would expect to see some benefit from lower commodity prices, so are we to assume that some of that is being reinvested in your advertising? Jim Snee : Yes, we\u2019re making significant advertising investments in the GP business. The GP core business remains very strong, very healthy across the entire portfolio. The difficulty, the headwind really is--you know, we talked about contract manufacturing and then also that continued recovery of CytoSport. Jeremy Scott : Right. Just one follow-up on Fremont. The product that you\u2019re currently producing today and selling fresh at Fremont, you\u2019re now going to turn around be a customer of that product and you intend to produce it into value-add, at least a portion of it. To what extent does that incremental demand for this new stream of value-added pork exist today, or should we assume that you\u2019re going to be pushing a lot of this product onto the marketplace? Jim Sheehan : As we\u2019ve stated, we\u2019re a net buyer of bellies and trim, and we utilize all of our ribs. We utilize 100% of the product coming off of Austin for value-added products. There are some excess products coming off of Fremont, and we\u2019ve had our stated goal--as we\u2019ve stated in the past, our goal is not to sell any commodity meat at all, so as we expand our production, for instance at Dold as we expand our Natural Choice product lines, those products will go into--those commodity products now will go into value-added products. Jeremy Scott : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back to our hosts for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Thank you all for joining us today, and a special thanks to all of our team members for their efforts as we wrap up our fiscal year and successfully deliver on our key results. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Hormel Foods Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, November 20, 2018. I would like to turn the conference over to Nathan Annis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Annis.

Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. Throughout the year, we made significant progress towards our long-term vision as a global branded food company. With an emphasis on brand building, innovation, acquisitions and intentional balance, our long-term approach allowed us to manage through difficult situations, such as commodity market volatility, increased freight and global trade uncertainty. This year was marked by many milestones. We made the largest acquisition in our Company's history with the purchase of Columbus Craft Meats, and we also successfully integrated both Columbus and Fontanini into our supply chain. We reinvested a record amount of capital back into our company to increase capacity and improve the efficiency. Major capital projects in 2018 included the Dold foods, pre-cooked bacon expansion and a highly automated Holberg facility. We also delivered many innovative new items to the marketplace, items such as Herdez guacamole salsa, Natural Choice snacks, Applegate Naturals products in the retail space and Fire Braised Flank Steak for food service customers. On our financial perspective, we delivered record sales, earnings and cash flows. 2018 also represented the 90th consecutive year of paying a quarterly dividend. Our strong financial results and confidence in the business allowed us to announce our 10th consecutive double digit increase in the dividend for 2019, which will mark our 53rd consecutive year of dividend increases. By many measures, 2018 was a success. Refrigerated foods made impressive contributions to our performance with significant growth coming from value-added brands in retail, deli and food service. However, there are areas of the business that did not meet our expectations. Jennie-O Turkey store had another difficult year as they manage through continued oversupply in the Turkey industry. And CytoSport had a disappointing year with declines in powder and single serve ready to drink product lines. We are taking appropriate actions in both businesses and expect a return to growth in 2019. Looking at the fourth quarter, we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $0.51, a 24% increase.  Many brands and product lines across all four segments drove growth. This effort was led by the success in refrigerated foods and overcame significant commodity headwinds to deliver impressive results in all parts of their business. Our international team also delivered strong growth in the quarter, led by exports of branded products. For the total company, sales increased 1% on a 1% decline in volume. The sales increase was driven by our MegaMex joint venture and growth of branded products in refrigerated foods. The Fontanini, Columbus craft meats and Ceratti acquisitions met our expectations for the year and contributed to the increase for the quarter. On an organic basis, volume and sales declined 3% due to weakness in contract manufacturing and lower commodity market. Refrigerated foods grew volume 2% and sales 6%. Products, such as Applegate, Natural and Organic Meats, Hormel Natural Choice products, Hormel Fire Braised meats, and Hormel pepperoni, all delivered excellent growth this quarter. Sales also increased due to the Fontanini and Columbus acquisitions. A reduction in hog harvest volume of 3% drove an organic volume decline of 2% and organic sales decline of 3%. Pricing declined due to lower pork market. Refrigerated food was able to deliver 25% increase in profits even as commodity profits declined 31%. The team was able to offset higher freight costs and higher advertising investments. I am particularly proud of how the refrigerated foods team continues to shift the portfolio towards branded value-added products. International sales increased 7% on volume growth of 5%. We saw strong sales increases on branded exports of products such as SPAM lunch and meat and Skippy peanut butter. The addition of the Ceratti business in Brazil also drove the sales increase. International segment profit increased 7% in spite of lower fresh pork exports and increased freight costs. Lower SG&A expenses also contributed to improved earnings. Jennie-O Turkey store volume and sales declined 4%, primarily due to whole bird sales decline. As we mentioned on our last call, a portion of our whole bird sales were shifted to the third quarter to minimize cold storage expenses. Sales of Jennie-O lean ground Turkey and premium deli items showed sales growth this quarter. Segment profit declined 31% due to lower whole bird prices, increased freight and higher feed costs. Grocery products sales decreased 4% as strong volume and sales growth of Herdez salsa and Wholly Guacamole dips did not offset declines in our contract manufacturing business. Adjusted segment profit decreased 6% on lower sales and higher freight expenses. This year, we made excellent progress on our path forward that I laid out at our 2017 Investor Day. This included becoming a broader food company, expanding and accelerating food service, becoming a more global company, reducing volatility, divesting non-strategic assets and modernizing our supply chain. We will continue to execute against these initiatives in 2019. I anticipate a combination of external factors will impact our business this year. On one hand, we expect to benefit from lower pork input costs and a return to more normalized fundamentals in the Turkey industry. On the other hand, we expect continued inflationary pressure in addition to commodity market volatility. Our team's ability to focus on the controllable elements of the business will help us manage through these challenges. The quality and speed at which we are bringing innovation to the marketplace will be even better than it was in 2018. Our pipeline of innovative products will help us achieve our 15% by 2020 challenge. We made progress toward this innovation goal in 2018 as more than 14% of our sales came from products innovative in the last five years. In 2019, we expect continued growth from innovative products such as Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Fire Braised Meats, Natural Choice, snacks, taps and wraps and Herdez guacamole salsa. The start of fiscal 2019 is also the official beginning of our new Hormel deli solutions division, which combines all aspects of our deli brands and businesses into one group within refrigerated foods. As we outlined at CAGNY in February, this new division delivers an unmatched array of high quality deli and prepared foods offerings marketed and sold through a direct sales organization. We are excited to help retailers create the deli of the future. Looking at the segments for 2019, we expect all four business units to show sales and profit growth. The fundamentals in the Turkey industry are showing slow improvement with declines in placements and cold storage stocks. For the first time in over two years, we are seeing signs of consolidation within the industry. While we are encouraged by these factors, we continue to take proactive steps to restore the growth of this business. Our expectation this year is for a modest recovery in the turkey industry and earnings growth from Jennie-O Turkey store. Commitments to control costs, optimize the supply chain and investments in the Jennie-O brand will be important in 2019. Similar to 2018, we expect an increase in branded value-added sales and profits in refrigerated food. Growth will be led by our teams in food service, deli and Applegate. Gains in our value-added businesses are expected to once again offset a reduction in commodity profits. International is expected to have a strong year. Exports of branded products and gains in China and Brazil will offset continued declines in fresh pork exports. We see sales and earnings growth in grocery products coming from established brands such as spam and Skippy in addition to emerging brands such as Justin's, Wholly Guacamole and Herdez. We also expect a meaningful contribution from the Muscle Milk brand. Our supply chain is complex and for many years we were able to capture incremental savings through grassroots projects, known internally as best of the best. Since reorganizing our supply chain teams into one structure at the beginning of 2018, our teams have been thinking differently about ways to optimize procurement, manufacturing and logistics. In 2018, the team was able to capture over $70 million in savings through a focus on in-sourcing production, better asset utilization and more automation in our manufacturing facility, all while managing the sale of our Fremont plants and dealing with higher freight costs. These results speak to our culture of corporate and personal accountability. For 2019, our cost savings target is $75 million. Areas of opportunity cover the entire spectrum of our supply chain. We plan to use the savings to help offset inflation, reinvest into key brands and contribute to earnings growth. One macro factor we are continuing to watch closely is freight. We saw a double-digit increase in 2018, and we expect another large increase in 2019. We remain focused on finding mutually agreeable solutions with our customers and if necessary, increasing prices. Taking all these factors into account, we are setting our full-year earnings guidance at $1.77 to $1.91 per share and our sales guidance at $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion. This guidance reflects pretax and segment profit growth across all of our business units, driven by strong retail, food service, deli and international performance. As a reminder, we had a significant tax benefit in 2018 due to tax reform. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for fiscal 2019. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2018 was a record year for sales and earnings per share, operating cash flow and dividend. Our financial strategy is aligned with our vision for the Company. The balance sheet is strong and capital allocation decisions support the long term growth strategy. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.3 billion pounds, a 1% decrease compared to 2017. For the full year, volume grew 1%. In the fourth quarter, sales were $2.5 billion, a 1% increase. Sales for 2018 were $9.5 billion, a 4% increase. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $261 million, up 20% compared to last year. Full-year earnings were $1 billion, also a 20% increase. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year were $1.89, a 20% increase. In the quarter, we recognized non-cash impairment of $17 million or $0.03 per share associated with the CytoSport business. The impairment was recorded in the grocery product segment. For the full year, SG&A excluding advertising was 7.2% of sales compared to 6.8% last year. The impact of acquisitions drove the increase. In 2019, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline as the company continues to focus on funding efficiencies throughout the organization. For the year, advertising was $152 million compared to $136 million last year. We continue to shift investments between advertising and trade to attain the highest return. In 2019, we plan to use advertising to support such brands as SPAM, Hormel pepperoni, Hormel Natural Choice, Columbus and Jennie-O. General corporate expenses increased in 2018, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including the universal stock option grant for all employees. For the full year operating margins were 12.6%, 140 basis points lower than 2017. Higher freight in all segments and whole bird declines at Jennie-O contributed to the decrease. We expect operating margins to improve in 2019. The full year effective tax rate was 14.3% compared to 33.7% in 2017. The decline was due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed December 2017. The effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be between 20.5% and 23%. In 2018, we generated cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion compared to $1 billion last year. The primary use of cash was CapEx, the acquisition of Columbus and dividends. Capital expenditures for the year were $390 million, including the expansion of value-added capacity at Dold and a highly automated whole bird facility. We anticipate capital expenditures to be $350 million in 2019. Major projects include the expansion of value-added capacity, investments to improve efficiencies and expanded automation in our plants. We paid our 361st consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15th at an annual rate of $0.75 per share. We also announced the double-digit dividend increase. This was the 53rd consecutive year we have increased the dividend and the 10th consecutive year we have increased the dividend at a double-digit rate. We repaid the remaining short-term debt associated with the Columbus acquisition in the fourth quarter, ending the year with $625 million in total debt. We remain in a strong financial position to fund other capital needs given our low level of debt and consistent cash flow. Share repurchases for the full year totaled $47 million, representing 1.4 million shares. We will continue to repurchase factor offset solution from stock option exercise and based on our internal valuation. We continue to monitor supply and demand in the hog industry. We expect hog supplies to increase next year. Near-term volatility is heavily dependent on the progress of the new plants ramping up to full production. Domestic pork prices have declined due to an abundant supply of protein on the market. We expect this to continue into 2019. Lower protein prices benefit our value-added businesses. We expect exports to be up 3% to 4% in 2019. However, the African swine fever outbreak in China could impact U.S. pork exports.  Input costs for the fourth quarter were generally lower. Product prices were 16% lower than last year and well below the five-year average. We expect slight increases to hog prices next year. USDA composite values declined 9%. We expect USDA composite value to be lower in 2019. In 2019, our hard purchases our hog purchases will decline approximately 30%, reducing the exposure from the volatility of hog prices. When the Fremont sale is final, we will be purchasing all hogs from the facility is based on the USDA composite value. Included in our guidance is a decline in commodity profits due to the reduced harvest level and lower industry margins. Deli markets declined 11%, finishing below the five-year average. Overall, we expect modestly lower deli prices and continued volatility in 2019. 72% pork trim prices were 14% below last year. We expect trim markets to be lower in 2019, especially in the first half. 50% beef trim was 9% higher. We expect beef trim prices to be flat next year, compared to 2018. Feed costs were higher driven by soya meal. We expect feed costs to be higher in 2019. Industry data shows turkey pull placements down 3% over the last six months, cold storage of breast meat is 12% below 2017 but higher than the five-year average. Despite improvements in both key drivers, recovery remains low. Turkey commodity prices, including whole birds pressured Jennie-O results in 2018 despite higher breast meat prices. Whole bird prices were 15% lower than last year. The multiyear lows will persist through this calendar year. Whole bird prices next year will be impacted by Thanksgiving volume. Breast meat prices were 33% higher. We expect higher breast meat prices in 2019. As Jim discussed, we created a new deli division within refrigerated foods. As a result, beginning in 2019, we will report Jennie-O deli results within the refrigerated food segment. Actual deli sales and profits, including an allocation of supply chain profits, will be transferred from Jennie-O to refrigerated foods. The size of the deli business moving from Jennie-O to refrigerated foods is approximately $300 million in sales with margins in line with the Jennie-O segment. The Company will restate the segment results beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The sale of the three months plan to WholeStone Farms is scheduled to close in December. We will incur approximately $12 million of expenses in the first quarter to build value-added equipment out of the facility and various pension related expenses. In 2018, the team demonstrated an ability to manage through various market factors and volatility. We are confident in the plan for 2019 and our strategy for delivering long term value to shareholders. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator from the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Can you clarify a little bit how we should think about the supply chain savings? You've talked about 75 million, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it includes any bigger more restructuring type savings. Is that something that should likely down the road or what's the right way to think about that? Jim Snee : I think the best way to think about it Michael is we started-off the year saying the thing that we had to get right was the structure and the process, and making that we could indentify capture, validate and strategically reinvest the savings. So the team is thinking differently as we look to optimize procurement manufacturing and logistics. And certainly 2018 keen focus on labor, overhead, supply. Of course, let's not forget the fact that we put them in the middle of the freight increases and the Fremont divestiture. So they have a lot going on. 2019 we'll have some of the things. But I will tell you that they're also starting to pivot towards the bigger and more structural thing. So an example of that would be as the baseline for freight has probably shifted over the long-term is making sure that we have the most optimize network possible. And so what does that look like for a distribution center, how do we travel fewer miles over the long-term. So, yes we are getting to those bigger and more structural issues. But right now, it is a combination of some of the short-term and long-term things. Michael Lavery : And your number for '19, could that have upside as you get into some of these projects later in the year or do you have a pretty good best amount of visibility and those will be further down the road? Jim Snee : Those will be a little further down the road. I mean for us what is realistic so that we know disciplined and thoughtful, and we'll know more as we get closer. Jim Sheehan : The other item I would add, Michael, is that $75 million we're talking about excludes any previously announced synergies that we have in our acquisitions. Operator : And will take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Couple of things on the guidance I was curious about. What is -- is that the sales guide is pretty lofty, especially in light of the fourth quarter numbers being below expectations, particularly on price. Can you give us a little more color on how you got there? And are you expecting some price recovery in the commodity markets in order to get there? And then secondly on the guide, you said that you thought hog prices would be up, but that the composite would be lower for '19, and how you've got that assumption as well? Jim Snee : As we've looked across the different segments, we look at the sales guidance as realistic. When we think about grocery products coming off a weaker Q4 and really the driver there was the fact that we did have some incremental sales in Q4 of '18 -- we didn\u2019t have in 18 that we did have in '17, but we think we're set up really well because the baseline for our GP business are very healthy. So heading into 2019, we expect that business to show mid single digits growth. Refrigerated foods, it\u2019s a lot more the same in terms of the value-added growth that we expect to see. We\u2019re not expecting anything crazy and JOTS. I mean we've got low single digit increase there, which we believe is very achievable. And then our international growth on the top line is really in line with our historic expectations of high single-digit. So do believe the guide on the sales is very realistic and achievable, and maybe I'll ask give you little more color on your other question. Jim Sheehan : We expect the hog industry to be similar to the structural makeup of 2018, including the supply growth and the volatility based on the capacity coming online. Hog prices right now are low we expect them to be up in the low single-digits. Regarding the spread, we expect the higher supply, the beef that will be available because of the additional capacity coming online while lower the commodity prices, including we expect delis and trimmed hog to be down in 2019. Robert Moskow : And have you put any assumptions for China's hog herd disease issues, and what that might mean for American exports? Is that a positive or negative or too soon to tell? Jim Sheehan : It's really too soon to tell. And I would tell you, Rob, we have limited African swine fever risk assumed in this plan, because of exactly what you said. It's a risk to the China business but potentially an opportunity for our pork export business. We do believe that if it is a risk to China that we'll be able to take some pricing in line with the rest of the market, but it s really too early to tell. But we're watching and it's certainly in our radar like I\u2019m sure it is everyone else's. Operator : And we will take our next question from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : I just wanted to ask about the first quarter set up. In the past, you provide some commentary and the queues around the call and how you\u2019re seeing margins or EBIT overall trend across the different segments. I was hoping you could provide that here again on that first quarter set up? Jim Snee : Yes, so we haven\u2019t really done so much by quarter. Last year, we talked a little bit about JOTS just because of the very unique situation we were in and the recovery was heavily skewed to Q2. I would tell you or I would guide you to the couple of things that we have called out for Q1 that will impact the business as we did have the benefit last year of a mega tax credit and then you heard in Jim Sheehan's comments the fact that we will have some Fremont closing expenses in Q1. So obviously, we're going to have that as a headwind early in the year. Thomas Palmer : And then just to follow-up on that on the Muscle Milk side, you mentioned meaningful contribution for the year. Is that both top and bottom? And can you maybe talk about what you're already seeing in that business in terms of its inflection? Jim Snee : So that would imply top and bottom line growth from the Muscle Milk business. And again we've talked about several different components the part of the business that has grown throughout the year and continues to show growth is really the take home or the multi-pack Tetra business. You've seen that in more food drug and mass as they expand out their sports nutrition category, that business has been healthy and will continue to be in 2019. We've seen recovery in the ready to joint space. So we saw growth in the back half of the year like we had said we would, and we expect that to continue in 2019. The area of the business that continues to be under pressure now is the powder business, and really the driver there is just that shift from the traditional brick-and-mortar specialty channel into more online business, and we have spent time and effort and resources building-up that muscle for that digital competency that supports the e-commerce business. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Akshay Jagdale : I wanted to ask about the Turkey business. Obviously, there has been some headwinds from the industry and the commodity pricing a little bit. Can you -- as you\u2019ve gone through this cycle, which has been quite long. Can you talk about what -- maybe helps us dimensionalize the company specific issues cost wise that you think you can address going into next year. I mean when you go through a down cycle, I'm sure you tighten the belt a little bit more. But there was also some specific cost issues in your grow out division. So can you help us put into context where we are in turkey, genuine turkey margins and how much of the -- underperformance is industry versus company specific high-level? Jim Snee : I think the key driver in JOTS is that we need better fundamentals in the industry. I mean that really is what is going to get us where we need the business to be. And so we've seen some of that happening, but we're still disappointed in the pace. And so we're looking into 2019, we are just projecting a modest growth. But in that modest growth, we know that we'll continue to outperform the industry. And so in some of the areas that Jim mentioned, Akshay, we continue to have a keen focus on security for our facilities to make sure we can avoid another avian influenza outbreak. We had talked about the work that we\u2019re doing in the raise without antibiotics initiatives. And our team continues to make progress and they are making it more efficient and cost-effective. Clearly, they're impacted as much as anyone on the freight side of the business, and so that's not unique to them. And that\u2019s really a companywide initiative on how can we find those mutually agreeable solutions with consumers, while still working in the long term to optimize our network. The other part is we see it as a business that continues to be on trend. We invested in the brands this year. We'll be reinvesting in the brand again in 2019, as we know, Turkey is on trend. And so we have to continue to outperform the industry, and we think the things we've done put us in a position to be point to accelerate our performance, our outperformance versus the industry. Jim Sheehan : Akshay, one item that I would add is that we\u2019re very excited about the new Melrose plant coming online in the spring. That\u2019s a state-of-the-art plant that will really take our efficiencies to a new level. So that will, as Jim said, the business has outperformed the industry for a long time. This is going to allow us to increase that outperformance. Akshay Jagdale : And just one follow-up on what Rob was asking about, but maybe in a different way. Looking through your segments, your business is so unique with the exposure to commodity meat prices that it's hard to really tell what's happening with full price. So can you at high level give us sense what you\u2019re seeing pricing wise as it relates to freight cost being up and overall food industry inflation has picked up. And so we feel like all the companies are talking about taking pricing. But what's your take on where we are in that cycle? Are you finding more success now than six months ago? Or how would you characterize the environment? Jim Snee : I think we\u2019re no different than anybody else in that. We\u2019re looking at all of these macro factors. So whether it's African swine fever, freight, tariffs, exports. It's clearly a dynamic situation. And we continue to look at it really on a category-by-category basis. And so refrigerated foods and JOTS are more market based, closer to the market. And so you do have pricing that will move a bit more frequently. GP pricing really is less market driven and impacted by the macro issues that we're talking about. And we took pricing obviously late '17 early '18, and we are looking at only categories by category basis. And we don\u2019t just look at pricing. We\u2019re taking that holistic view of each of our brands in each of our categories understands the levers in regards to trade, other revenue growth management initiatives, and obviously making sure we understand the corresponding projected elasticity. And I guess I would really look the fact that pricing has never easy, never has been so think it ever will be. But the fact that we have number one and number two brands also puts us in a very solid position to make sure that we are taking those leadership roles. Akshay Jagdale : And just one last housekeeping one, the guidance for next year order of magnitude in terms of the profits that will be gone as a result of the three months deal. Is it roughly still -- I forget. But did you say $10 million? I mean, I know the costs are 12, but what's the profit contribution roughly that you are assuming will not be in the P&L next year? Jim Snee : We discussed in the script that commodity profits would be down 40% from this year, and a major portion of that is the three Fremont plants, the sale of the Fremont plant but we also expect that those -- the margins on those or the spread on those hogs are going to decrease during the year. So I think it's a combination of both. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : I think I know the answer to this, just want to make sure -- little follow-up on the guidance question but the expenses that you outlined, which will probably come in Q1, if the sales of Fremont happens in December. How much of those expenses are included in your guidance or not excluding, so you are -- that's a GAAP. I'm assuming it's a GAAP number. Is that a fair assumption? Jim Snee : That's a fair assumption, Eric. Eric Larson : And then the second question, which I wanted to follow-up on here is, we saw the impairment charge for CytoSport in the quarter. I think Jim talked a little bit about the issue of sales moving more toward the e-commerce side of the business. But is this a business that you're still putting a fair amount of advertising support behind it? Is that the only fix that you need? Or what else in the powder side and I think it's also still widely competitive. But what else needs to happen for CytoSport to get back on track? Jim Snee : One of the things, Eric, that I called out was as those sales have shifted, we were behind the curve in terms of having the digital infrastructure that we needed. And so that has a big initiative for us and we feel like we're in a position now where we have the appropriate content and sales infrastructure that we need. From an advertising perspective, the team that we have in place has reallocated some of those advertising dollars into slightly different messaging, which we're finding to be highly effective. And so I think those were really two of the bigger things that we had to get done and we're well-positioned for 2019. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : I guess the first question in Jennie-O. I think you talked about modest profit improvement for fiscal '19. Can talk about the pass through a couple of here? I mean it would look like some of the market indicators are moving in the right direction in terms of breast meat pricing being above $2 in terms of pulp placements being down, competitor potentially shutting down early in the new year. And I guess still only calling for modest profit improvement. Can you help us think about the path to getting back to those mid-teens margins this business did pre-avian flu? Jim Snee : I think you touched on this. It's really the fundamentals are moving in the right direction. I think the biggest issue there is really the disappointment in the pace. And so even though the trend in the last quarter was down for full placements, if you look at October, it was actually up a little bit. So I think we've got to stay on track with those fundamentals and see them accelerate. You're correct in regards to breast meat pricing. We see that as a positive. We see inventory levels coming down certainly as a positive but again, still at historically high level. So we need to see that accelerate. We will continue -- as we said several times, we will continue to outperform the industry and the things that we're doing behind the scenes really help us be in place to accelerate the outperformance, but to get back to truly more normalized levels, we need to see the fundamentals accelerate. Adam Samuelson : And then my second question is over in refrigerated foods, the organic volumes in the quarter were down 2%, you attributed that to lower hog harvest levels. At what point does the organic volume trajectory in refrigerated disconnect from hog harvest. And just trying to think about layering in Columbus and Fontanini's as a glare into organic through the first -- through or after the first quarter. I mean at some point you should need to be growing this on the volume side the new capacity that you put in. I mean did that happen sooner or just help us think about the past actually started grow the volumes here organically? Jim Snee : I think 2019 is the year that you will see that where it will be the investments that we've made in those businesses that are driving volume, sales and earnings growth. We see that across the board. We've been very intentional in terms of the investment to support value added business and 2019 is a year that you will see that really connect. Operator : And we will take our next question from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Now a question on the deli business and you've mentioned you're going to move what you basically had within the Jennie-O Turkey up into the refrigerated foods segment. And you have nicely associated the sale volume, as well as the profitability. Now the question is for the whole restructuring and bringing that together. Are there any additional costs we should be aware of that you're going to encourage us by consolidating that business? And if you could share what is the size of the business if it's at some stage you would consider to actually spin it off from the refrigerated food segment and reported on a standalone basis just to get a little more magnitude of this business that would be my first question? Jim Snee : In regards to the deli business, we don't have any other expenses that we're expecting in 2019 and beyond as we've consolidated this business. For us the bigger issues most of the work was done in 2018 really bringing all of these businesses together and integrating them behind the scenes, there was a lot of work that took place. And so as we've set-off into fiscal 2019 really being able to stand-up this organization and have them ready to go is exciting. In regards to the last part of your question, we've said it's about $1 billion business, and haven't really given any thought into splitting it and operating like that, because it is still closely linked and tied to refrigerated food. It makes perfect sense to have it there. And really the focus now is achieving and doing what we said we were going to do and making sure that it's A, our next growth engine and really helping retailers create the deli of the future and to capitalize on that opportunity. Benjamin Theurer : So basically $1 billion that's what the $300 million that comes in from Jennie-O. Correct? Jim Snee : Yes. Benjamin Theurer : And then last on the international part, I mean clearly, their sales was -- strong driven. Could you give a little bit update on how the Brazil acquisition is doing, the Ceratti brand, how you\u2019ve being doing, how the competitive environment has been doing? Because what I've seen is that at least in some of the prepared food side business, we've seen major competitors being relatively aggressive on increasing pricing. So wanted to get your exposure there and how you were able to benefit from that environment? Thanks. Jim Snee : So the Ceratti acquisition has met all of our expectations. And as we said, it's really given us a great entry point into the Brazilian market. In 2018, we did take some pricing down there as I think there\u2019re some macro issues around inflation but we've been able to successfully pass along pricing, a reminder that the brand is a premium value-added brand very well recognized by Brazilian consumers. And so it mirrors a lot of what we have here in the United States in terms of being a premium authentic high quality artisanal brand that resonates with consumers. And so business is meeting all expectations. We're in the midst of continuing to make sure we're innovating, adding capacity to capitalize on the growth opportunities that are down there. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Jeremy Scott : So just wanted to clarify on refrigerated foods guidance being up next year so just want clarify, this includes the $15 million to $20 million in closing costs, which I think is what you estimated last quarter. It includes the estimated $10 million decline in commodity profits but it doesn't include the reconciliation of let's say $35 million, $40 million in JOTS business being reclassified into refrigerate food. So is your guidance implying that there's something in the range of $65 million to $75 million in organic operational improvements in fiscal 19? Jim Snee : I think it's fair to say everything that you've talked about is included in the growth that we're looking for in 2019. I think the $12 million is going to be in general corporate, but it's reflected in our overall number. But I think the other the other elements that you\u2019re talking about really are reflected in refrigerated foods, and it will be another strong year for them. Jeremy, I guess if there's any more specific detail that you need certainly Nathan can be available to give you those answers. Jeremy Scott : But just want to make sure the Jennie-O reclassification is or isn\u2019t included in your guidance, so refrigerate would've being up next year? Jim Snee : So that is now -- the Jennie O business has shifted into our deli organization, which is now included in refrigerated foods. So we are essentially rebasing refrigerated foods to reflect that. Jeremy Scott : And probably if you could expand on the pre-Fremont post-Fremont dynamic in refrigerate. I think you said commodity products would be done, hog harvest will be down but you\u2019re getting your contract there would be no impact on volumes. So can you clarify what percentage of the tonnage that you will be buying from WholeStone under contract that will effectively be passed through, or in other words the profit that you don\u2019t turn into value-added, the green hands and their equivalents? Could you just quantify that if possible? And then within that, are there products that you're going to be entirely passing through and will there be products that you don\u2019t necessary add value on but you'll earn a spread, because you're locked into contract with a customer and you're getting capability there? Jim Snee : So we will take all of the meat coming off of Fremont line. Some of that meat will go into our value-added products. Some would be sold as fresh pork. We retain all margins on fresh pork sales. So we\u2019re purchasing the meat at the USDA composite carcass value. So the spread between the carcass value and the sale and either the retail or the provisions market belongs to Hormel. So we\u2019re taking down our harvest by 30% and as we see it, this is with the additional capacity coming online, this is exactly why we made the move to sell Fremont and de-risk the refrigerated foods business and that is the structure. Jeremy Scott : And then just maybe lastly on the 12% dividend hike into your provided guidance, so a solid acceleration in the payout ratio does not entirely off trend given what you've done in the past decade. But just curious what was the rationale for leaning into the payout in 2019? And should we be interpreting that as a recalibration, however, slight -- how you're thinking about M&A opportunities that maybe at your doorstep? Jim Snee : I think the biggest driver, obviously, is the strong cash flows of our business, strong cash flows and clearly our balance sheet remains strong for the organization. This is consistent with what we've done over the last decade, so the strong cash flows but the optimism that we have in our business going forward. So as we head off into 2019 and beyond, clearly the dividend is one of the levers when we think about capital allocation but we are in a very, very strong position to make any acquisition that we think is appropriate and strategic for us. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : A real quick on your comments on freight, so some of your -- some of the other companies in the industry are talking about not lower freight in '19 but honestly, more benign commentary on the outlook than what you articulated. So I was wondering if you could -- are you envisioning inflation similar to what you saw in '18 on the freight side. Jim Snee : I think it's going to be a little lower than we saw in fiscal year 2018. We believe that there is still pressure but there's a bit more balance in the marketplace now that the freight lines have had time to work on, and certainly we've spent time working on it. So I guess I don\u2019t want to overstate it but certainly it's a headwind in 2019. And again, it really goes back to this longer-term solution that our supply chain team is working on and what is the right network optimization for us. Heather Jones : And then on advertising, so you guys had talked about 20% increase for '18, it came in below that and I think you made some comment about shifting it into other types of promotion that you found more effective. Could you help us -- give us the sense of what you're thinking about advertising dollars in '19 as far as year-on-year increase? Jim Snee : So at the end of the first-quarter, what I've said was that we would increase our advertising and promotional spending in the neighborhood of 20%. And as you know, we were always working to find the highest ROI between all methods of brand support. And while advertising was significantly ahead of last year, good strong double-digit increase, it was below that 20% but we did see our trained dollars come in above plan by an equal amount. So we hit the number that we thought we would, and it does ebb and flow in terms of how we spend those dollars across brands and dollars. The real message here is that we're dynamically managing this brand support for the highest ROI, and we do a lot of time -- spend a lot of time around revenue growth management, pricing, trade, advertising all of those things. So we feel good with what we've said and what we ended up spending. And then we're going to have a fine increase in 2019. And in Jim Sheehan's comments, he talked about some of the brands where we'll be spending those dollars. We'll continue to support the SPAM brand who just -- they're coming off their fourth consecutive record year, and it's a brand that we know will respond well to advertising. We've spent a lot of time and effort and dollars under our Umbrella brand, Natural Choice, and of course the reinvestment in Jennie-O Turkey store business. So feel like our investments are giving us the returns that we need whether they're advertising or trade. Operator : And we will take our final question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Just s couple things to clear up. Frank, can you give us a sense of what the dollar inflation was in fiscal '18, just to get a sense of the headwinds just all in all. Second bellies, belly prices I think started pretty low in the quarter and were rising. Were you hedged on belly, did you get a really strong bacon margin in the quarter? And do you expect that to ease off in first quarter, just because of the slope of the curve going higher. Maybe give us a little more clarity on what those bacon margins look like? Jim Snee : The freight was $0.06 to $0.08 in 2018, belly markets as I said, we think that we will see volatility and we have seen volatility this year in bellies. We do not have a hedge on bellies right now. We still believe that they're going to be lower over the year. And I'll let Jim talk a little bit about the margins on the bacon. Jim Sheehan : Our bacon business was very strong, and it ties into to my previous answer in terms of really where is the biggest ROI in terms of pricing or trade. And so we navigate through that. But I would tell you that we\u2019re very pleased with bacon performance for the year, for the quarter, both top line and bottom line. Robert Moskow : Last question, corporate expense it was like $60 million this year. I think it's twice as high as the year before. Should we expect it to be similar in fiscal '19? I didn\u2019t catch that. Jim Sheehan : Well, we'll have the $12 million from the closing of the Fremont sale in corporate expenses, so it won't be -- that will put pressure on increasing the corporate expenses. Robert Moskow : So something in the mid-70s then, Jim. Jim Sheehan : No, we don\u2019t see them that high. Operator : And there are no further phone questions, at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Snee for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Great, thank you. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you to all of you for joining us today. To our team members listening in, thank you for all your tireless work that allows our company to be so successful in the marketplace. Your focus on delivering our key results and maintaining our culture of accountability will continue to make this company uncommon in the marketplace. Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. As a global branded food company, we remain focused on our formula for success which includes building strong brands, developing innovative new items, making strategic acquisitions, and creating intentional balance. This time-tested strategy continued to serve us well this quarter as improvements in our branded value-added businesses once again, offset significant declines in our commodity businesses. We will continue to be intentional about shifting our portfolio away from commodity products and the associated earnings volatility. Our efforts in brand building continue to pay off as retail brands like SPAM, Denti Moore, Mary Kitchen Hash, Hormel Bacon toppings, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Hormel Pepperoni, Natural Choice, Columbus and Applegate, all showed solid growth this quarter. Our brands have a number one or number two share in over 40 categories, that is up from 35 a year ago. As you think about the footprint of a retail outlet, there aren't too many places where you won't find a brand or a product owned by Hormel Foods. Our food service business remains robust both domestically and in China. Growth this quarter was led by brands such as Old Smokehouse, Hormel Fire Braised, Jennie-O and Skippy. Our products continue to solve for the challenges faced by operators around the globe. With exciting innovation pipelines, retail brands such as Natural Choice, Skippy, Justin's and Applegate; we'll continue to deliver innovation to the marketplace at a faster cadence than ever before. We continue to be very optimistic on key innovation in food service as well with brands like Fire Braised, and Hormel Bacon 1. This was the first quarter we had sufficient production capacity of Hormel Bacon 1, fully cooked Bacon at our newly expanded Wichita Kansas plant. Our strategic acquisition of Columbus Craft Meat, and the subsequent creation of our new Hormel deli solutions division within refrigerated foods is delivering on our commitment to help retailers create the deli of the future. In addition to the very strong financial performance, I'm also incredibly proud of the work the deli group and all supporting integration functions have done in the past year to put Hormel deli solutions in a position to outperform our expectations this quarter. Finally, our focus on intentional balance was evident as earnings growth in refrigerated foods international and Jennie-O more than offset a decline in grocery products. Looking at the first quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.44, a 21% decline compared to last year. Recall that last year's results included a large one-time benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We grew pre-tax earnings by 1% as three of our four segments delivered earnings growth. Three segments also delivered sales growth resulting in increased sales of 1% on volume growth of 1%. Refrigerated foods grew sales 2%. As I previously mentioned, our new Hormel deli solutions division delivered excellent results led by Columbus branded items and Jennie-O Premium deli meats. Our growth in the deli channel was balanced as all three focused areas; grab and go, prepare foods and behind the glass showed improvements for the quarter. Refrigerated foods grew earnings 3% even as commodity profits declined 70%; this represents a fourth consecutive quarter in which branded value-added product growth has more than offset a dramatic decline in commodity profits. And there are two brands that are playing an important role in the performance of refrigerated foods. The first brand is Hormel Pepperoni. Over the past few years, we have increased the media spend on this brand and our consumers are responding. According to IRI, our baseline volumes are up 10% in the past quarter. Hormel Pepperoni has also generated a compound annual growth rate over the last three years of 2% as we continue to gain new points of distribution. Like our iconic SPAM brand, Hormel Pepperoni is another example of how we can continue to grow a 100-year old brand. Next, the Applegate brand. We have known for quite some time that there was an opportunity in both food service and value-added fresh pork to leverage this market-leading brand. The combined team of Applegate, Hormel Food Service, and the Hormel Fresh Pork Group have been able to make excellent progress in expanding the Applegate brand beyond their current product lines. In food service, we are making inroads with colleges and universities, healthcare facilities, and other key customers and lodging. We are also starting to sell value-added fresh pork items allowing us to improve the efficiency of our natural and organic raw material supply chain. Grocery products sales increased 1% on a 3% volume increase. Brands such as SPAM, Denti Moore, Mary Kitchen Hash, Hormel Bacon Toppings, Herdez and Holy Guacamole generated excellent sales growth. The gains in these brands offset declines in contract manufacturing. Segment profits declined due to the effect of a non-operating tax benefit in our MegaMex joint venture last year. We also had a legal settlement this quarter, which compensated us for lost profits and offset part of the tax benefit last year. International sales increased 2% on volume growth of 1%. The SPAM and Skippy brands showed solid growth this quarter for both our export business and in China. Our business in China grew many product lines including refrigerated retail and food service products, SPAM lunch and meat and Skippy peanut butter. Our launch of the SPAM brand in China is exceeding expectations and our in-country team continues to make excellent progress growing households and points of distribution. International segment profits increased 1%, the progress we made in branded exports and in China exceeded the steep declines in fresh pork exports. Global trade uncertainty continued to impact our fresh pork exports. Jennie-O Turkey store volume sales and profits were flat for the quarter. We saw solid sales growth from our food service and commodity divisions, but those gains were offset by lower retail sales. We are starting to see incremental improvements in the Turkey industry, driven by lower pork placements and lower cold storage levels. We have yet to see meaningful improvements in commodity prices. During the quarter, we issued to voluntary recalls for lean ground turkey due to the presence of Salmonella ready. This resulted in a 10% decline and scanned retail sales volume of lean ground turkey during the quarter. The issue of Salmonella isn't new and it is an industry issue. We plan to continue our leadership role in the effort to reduce Salmonella and to educate consumers on how to safely handle and prepare raw turkey. Even though we experienced the rebound in sales after the recalls and have confidence in the long-term growth of lean ground turkey, we are being very conservative on our sales outlook. Additionally, the extreme cold weather this winter will adversely impact raw material costs in the next two quarters. We will continue to focus on improving our turkey supply chain and investing in the Jennie-O brand. But because of these recent events, we expect Jennie-O Turkey store to fall below the plan we had for them this year. We are encouraged by the outlook for refrigerated foods, grocery products, and international. We expect deli food service and our China business outperform our expectations. As we announced on Tuesday, we signed a definitive agreement to sell the CytoSport business to Pepsi. The CytoSport team should be pleased with the gains being made in the innovation space with the creation of the evolve product line, muscle milk bars, and multiple new flavors and formats for the muscle milk product line. The team also generated nice growth in the food drug and mass channel. However, it became apparent that Pepsi was the right long-term owner of this business given their expertise and scale in the beverage space. Pepsi has been a long-standing distribution partner or CytoSport and the muscle milk brand which puts them in a strong position to grow this dynamic business. Jim Sheehan will provide more information regarding the financial details of the pending transaction. We are reaffirming our full-year earnings guidance at $77 to $91 per share and our sales guidance at $9.7 billion to $10.2 billion. This does not include any impact from the pending CytoSport transaction. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan, to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Volume net sales and pre-tax profit for the first quarter were up 1% compared to 2018. Volume was \u00a31.2 billion with growth primarily coming from grocery products. Net sales of $2.4 billion and pretax profits of $307 million resulted from the strong performance of value-added products in refrigerated foods and international. Net earnings for the first quarter were $241 million down 20% compared to last year. Earnings per share were $0.44 down from $0.56. First quarter earnings in 2018 included a better set of $0.12 per share related to tax reform. Results were negatively impacted by $0.02 per share related to the sale of the Fremont facility. Expenses included the cost to move value-added equipment out of the facility and various pension-related items. These expenses were recognized and net unallocated expense. SG&A, excluding advertising was 6.6% of sales compared to 7.7% last year. The decline was due to a benefit of $0.02 per share from a legal settlement. This settlement was primarily recognized and net unallocated expense and the grocery products segment. Advertising for the quarter was $39 million compared to $40 million last year. Advertising investments are expected to remain consistent with our prior guidance as we support brands such as SPAM, Hormel Pepperoni and Wholly Guacamole. Equity in earnings declined reflecting the impact of a MegaMex non-operating tax benefit last year, and lower earnings from international joint ventures. Operating margins were 13%, unchanged from last year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.3% compared to 0.6% last year. The increase was primarily due to deferred tax re-measurements in 2018 as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act. The effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be between 20.5% and 23%. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $39 million compared to $54 million last year. We anticipate full-year capital expenditures to be $350 million. We paid our 362 consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $0.84 per share. A 12% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases for the quarter were $45 billion, representing 1.1 million shares. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on the internal valuation. As expected, hog supplies have increased and domestic pork prices have declined due to the abundant supply of protein on the market. Based on the supply structure, after the sale of Fremont, less than half of pork raw materials will sourced from the Austin harvest operation. This structure reduces the impact of hog costs on the business. Commodity profits in refrigerated foods declined 70% due to higher contracted hog costs. The sale of the Fremont plant did not materially impact commodity profits this quarter. Loaded hog markets were down 19% while the USDA composite value declined 12%. Both markets were down significantly relative to the five-year average. Hormel's hog cost exceeded the market due to a higher mix of frame-based contracts used during the quarter. Belly prices and beef trim were flat compared to last year while 72% pork trim prices declined 27%. Industry data shows improvement for turkey. Both placements continue to be lower and breast meat cold storage has declined. Recipe prices were 36% ahead of last year but remained below the five-year average. Big costs were up slightly in the first quarter. Our outlook for input costs remain unchanged with continued volatility due to global trade uncertainty related to African swine fever and tariffs. Regarding the CytoSport transaction, the purchase price is $465 million subject to adjustments at closing. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter. Sales in 2018 were approximately $300 million with operating margin slightly below the total company. We expect a sale to impact ongoing earnings by approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share for fiscal 2019. We expect a gain on the sale of $0.06 to 0.12 per share in the second quarter. Combined, the full-year estimate is expected to be a net $0.02 to $0.09 gain. Current guidance of $77 to $91 assumes no impact from the sale of CytoSport. We will update the impact of the sale and guidance after the sale is final. This quarter we started project Orion, a strategic initiative that will streamline and transform how we operate as a global branded food company. Hormel Foods currently runs multiple and independent on-premise support systems. The goal is to create a unified oracle cloud-based platform that brains the conveniences and technology of our everyday lives to the business environment. Our supply chain and HR teams will benefit from integrated systems with new capabilities. The finance organization will benefit from the transition of the on-premise oracle financial system to the Oracle cloud-based platform, including the use of robotic process automation. Systems will be simplified and modernized, giving our teams the actionable and timely data needed to derive deeper analytics and gain insight into our business. This project will generate efficiencies across our entire company and represents the next step and the execution of our long-term growth strategy. Our phased approach will allow us to see benefits this fiscal year and in future years. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator or the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Michael Lavery : You've talked about the value-added portion of the portfolio being a driver for growth, and yet you've also said that you're holding your advertising spend constant. How should we think about your brand building? And as that becomes not only a bigger part of the portfolio, but a bigger part of the growth, why wouldn't you think about increasing your marketing levels? Jim Snee : Michael, I mean the way we think about it is there's a lot more to brand building than just advertising. Certainly, that's a key part of it. But as when you think about how we align price, promotions, advertising, what's the right assortment and then also just improving efficiencies as we're dealing with customers, retailers, I mean those are all very, very important and we feel very comfortable with our spend levels across our brands and are very confident that the spending levels that we have are enough to support our strategy of increasing the value-added portfolio. So it is more than just advertising. Michael Lavery : Would it be right to say that you might have with the Deli group a little bit higher selling costs, but that that's also one another lever that isn't obviously advertising? Jim Snee : Well, I mean we have a direct selling organization in the deli space, which you would assume is a higher cost, but certainly from our perspective, more efficient and more important selling organization. It's an approach that we use across our food service business, our consumer product sales division, and now with the creation of our deli solution. So it's an important part also of all those things that we talked about, the price promotion, advertising, assortment, the salesforce is critical to our success in deli as well. Operator : And next we'll go to Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Eric Larson : Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the question. Just a quick, maybe I missed this; this is probably for Jim Sheehan. Jim, did you quantify the amount of the insurance gain in the quarter? I mean it looked like your unallocated corporate wasn't hugely different year-over-year. And where would that number have gone into? Would it be in grocery or how would that show up? Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Eric. The legal settlement, we quantified to be about $0.02, now I would point out that that's a gross number. We did incur expenses during the quarter two regarding this issue when there was some loss profit in the quarter. The impact on grocery products was less than $0.01, which is where we split up between grocery products and net unallocated. Eric Larson : So it's kind of a split in between all that. Okay. And then I know this might be sort of a more of a specialized question, but in your prepared comments, you mentioned that you were seeing some higher costs due to cold weather here. A lot of snow in the Midwest. I think in Jennie-O. Back five years ago when we had that issue you basically run your goal of houses with LPs I recall. And you were at that time going to start making an effort to try to get as much natural gas into some of those facilities, etcetera. Where do you sit on that and is LP still of a higher cost item, is that an issue yet for running your girl on houses in your turkey division? Jim Snee : Eric, it's not an issue. And we made good progress around natural gas, but obviously there's still some LP in the system. Really the bigger issue was getting birds into the facilities. And so, we've been in the middle of this polar vortex that everyone's talking about and so it has been problematic just really from getting the birds into the facilities. That's what we're talking about. Jim Sheehan : Eric, I want to follow-up on your question. And you also asked where we would have been with SG&A without these adjustments. Remember last year we also had a transaction in the SG&A. If you look at our SG&A be down slightly from last year when you take off your adjustments. Operator : And next will go to Heather Jones with Vertical Group. Heather Jones : So first, just a quick question on CytoSport. So when you update your guidance, I want to make sure I understood. So it would be estimated $0.03 to $0.05 diluted to ongoing earnings, but then there would be a gain on sales. So when y'all update your guidance once a transaction closes, are you going to include that gain on sales? Like, so should we expect your guidance to go higher? Jim Sheehan : Yes, we will give you guidance based on GAAP numbers but we will make it clear enough so that you will understand how much the gain on the sale is. Heather Jones : And then going back to Jennie-O; I was on another call and I think I missed some of this commentary, so I apologize for making you repeat. But the reduction and your guidance as well as the week are showing in the quarter, how much of that was due to weakness and the more commodity, the hand part of the business and how much of it was related to lower demand because of the recall? Jim Snee : Heather, the quarter was actually shaping up to be a good quarter for us. Then we did have the recalls and then as we talked a little bit about the polar vortex, but food service had a good quarter. Our commodity sales were positive. As a reminder, we did move Jennie-O deli turkey to refrigerated foods and we had a good quarter there. It really was the retail lean ground business and that was impacted as we said down 10%. We did see some spill over into other products. So I mean the recall really is what set us back for the quarter. Operator : And next we'll go to [indiscernible] with Oppenheimer. Unidentified Analyst : So first one had asked you about some of the pricing changes that you guys have made over the past few quarters. I was curious how they've played out versus your expectations and whether you've seen the expected volume impact associated with those pricing changes. Jim Snee : Sure. Probably the closest in a more CPG like pricing we've taken was on Hormel Pepperoni and the volume has actually exceeded our expectations. We talked a little bit in our prepared comments about the success that we've had with that 100-year-old brand, that 100-year-old business. So, having the number one number two brands certainly gives us a lot of brand power and pricing strength. And so if that has played out, if he called back a little further, we had taken some increases across our grocery products portfolio. And again, those all exceeded our expectations. So we feel good about where we are in a pricing environment right now right now Rupesh [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : And then second question on the commodity profit decline that we saw in refrigerated foods, I was just curious if you can just give us any thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about this hand wind for the balance of the year. Jim Sheehan : The biggest impact on the profitability was the hog costs. We buy hogs on a variety of formulas including the Western cutout, the Western corn belt cutout and grain-based formulas. The grain-based formulas were significantly a higher cost formula then the Western corn belt or other programs right now. So we will see some increase in the hog cost as we go forward. We think we'll see some recovery in the market so that the difference between the programs won't be as great as they were in the first quarter. You're starting to see them even out a little bit as we've gone into the second quarter, if that helps. Operator : And next we'll go to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I guess, first, I want to just make sure I'm understanding on the outlook and the different pieces, what has changed and any order of magnitude kind of for how much the Jennie-O outlook has been trimmed. And if you could dissect that between costs, kind of weather impacts and lower retail sales, that'd be helpful. And then just the other businesses to offset to keep the full-year outlook unchanged was trying to make sure I understand the magnitude of the different pieces. Jim Snee : Adam, so I think what we would tell you is the outlook for Jennie-O Turkey store we're now moving that to our flat to slightly down, and the other businesses that we talked about that are really going to show growth or overperform, we talked about the deli business, which is off to a great start in the first quarter food service continues to deliver and then a success that we're seeing in China. So, we have the right offsets there to maintain the guidance for the full year. As you get into some of those more maybe specific questions, you might want to take that offline with Nathan and he can probably add some additional color for you. Adam Samuelson : And then as a follow-up, I'm just trying to get an updated since on how you're planning for the impact of ASF across both your Chinese business and your U.S. business over the balance of the year number of cases continues to grow, could start having them more meaningful impact on hog in pork prices in China as you move through the year would guess it was a benefit this quarter and just how that progression lays out, it would be helpful. Jim Snee : Sure. We expect it to have a positive impact in future quarters as well. There's available meat in China as a result of ASF and it is at competitive prices. And we are being very strategic and intentional on the supply side of the business. That'll carry us through just about the balance of the year. So we feel really good about the input cost side of the China business. But I will tell you the other side of the story is the sales side. So really seeing the growth and the refrigerated retail, refrigerated foods service, the Skippy business, the continued implementation of our SPAM presence there, all of those are going really well. You know, when you think about the rest of the globe clearly like everybody else, we're monitoring the situation and closely. It's really too hard to say. So for us really it's that focus in China and controlling the thing that right now we can control and we feel like we're in a really good place. Adam Samuelson : But is it fair to say as you move -- if you move later in the year and you start to see an impact on pork prices in the U.S. that would be potentially an offset? Jim Snee : I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, if you go back to what happened during PEDB, you're going to have a lot of moving parts. And so we don't want to get out too far ahead of ourselves. Clearly, we could have some benefit. We talked about the steep decline in our international exports. We could have some benefits there. So, I hear what you're saying, but it's still too early to give a good read on that situation. Operator : And next we'll go to Thomas Palmer with JP Morgan. Thomas Palmer : I wanted to first kind of ask on the balance sheet following the sale of CytoSport, you're approaching a net cash balance. I know you can't get too specific, but any color on the M&A pipeline and also where you have the internal bandwidth to take on new businesses, I would assume, for instance, the daily operations have a good bit on their plate already. Jim Snee : Yes, that's a fair assessment, Thomas. Where continue to be very, very active looking for impactful M&A the areas that we've talked a lot about our desire to continue to add on to our very strong food service presence. We have capacity in our international business to do more. And then I think even in our domestic grocery products segment, we believe that with some of the M&A activity that's taken place, they'll probably be some carve outs. Then we also want to be very intentional about our ability to expand our MegaMax business. That's a business that's done really well for us. It's on trend and we'd love to get bigger faster there. So we've got a number of different places where M&A can fit and we are being very, very active. Thomas Palmer : And I had a quick follow-up on the ASF situation. So my understanding, you mentioned that kind of near term supply was being aided, I guess in part because you have farmers kind of pushing forward slaughter for some of their hogs. But I guess I was a little surprised that you thought that that would endure for much of this year. How long can that kind of excess supply linger in China? Maybe at what point do you think it kind of reverses? Jim Snee : So, I don't know how long the market will last. I guess what I was saying in terms of our position on what we have in our supply chain to secure our business for the balance of the year. I have not received an update or an outlook on what that looks like in China, but I will tell you that we feel good about our own supply chain to support our business through the balance of the year. Operator : And next we'll go to Robert Moscow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moscow : I have a couple of questions. One is on Skippy. I noticed you didn't mention it in your press release as a brand that grew. You also indicate that you were up and your biggest competitor has had some real big market share declines and now they announced in price cuts. Can you give us an update on what's happening with Skippy and how you might have to react to your competitor or lowering price? And then I had a question on cash flow. Cash flow was strangely down a lot in first quarter. It looks like there's something going on the working capital side. Can you give us a little more color on that? Jim Snee : Sure. I'm going to let Jim Sheehan handle the cash flow question first, Rob and I'll follow up on Skippy. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Rob. The big impact from the operating cash flow was the fact that this year our hog producers did not defer as much of their payments into the next year. Last year, there was an extremely large amount of deferral, even into the second and third quarter of their payments from the hogs that they had delivered the prior year. That was down drastically this year. And that's the impact that you're seeing in the operating cash flow. Jim Snee : It's more of a timing issue there, I think. Robert Moscow : Got it. Okay. Jim Snee : Let's talk about Skippy. Your first question or comment and we didn't talk about it, obviously we had a laundry list of brands in our prepared comments that we did talk about. So, Skippy certainly would have had a place in that list of brands because we have continued to see growth. As you mentioned, over the last 12-52 weeks, we've maintained our share, we're actually seeing some growth while the number one or share leader is down slightly. Clearly, there's growth in the private label space. From our perspective, we're a bit disappointed with the competitive dynamics. We knew this was coming and we are in the process of responding accordingly. We've been here before, we had a similar situation several years ago. I believe that we emerge out the other side as a stronger brand and a stronger business. And I would just say when it's all said and done, we do believe that the brand matters. The brand is important and that really trying to compete with private label on price is not a winning strategy over the long-term. But make no mistake about it, our teams understand what happened. We're in the process of reacting low respond accordingly. And in that response will be our continued focus on innovation. We've talked a lot about taking peanut butter out of the jar since we acquired the business. And we've done that with Skippy Fruit bites. Different formats. And now of course, we're in the midst of introducing our Skippy PB and J-minis, which just starting to roll out. But again, early reads are very positive. So, they're really good about the business. They'll really good about the brands and we'll manage through this situation as appropriate. Robert Moscow : Your tone on Skippy sounds more negative than on CytoSport. Maybe I'm misreading the tone, but what's happening with [indiscernible]? Jim Snee : Well, let me clarify that. That was not intended, the tone should be positive. Robert Moscow : But looking forward, are there retailers expanding shelf space for private label? Is that the problem that's hurting the category? Jim Snee : Well, I mean I think as you look at points of distribution and what's happened with private label, what's happened to the number one leader, I think there's a direct correlation. What I would tell you is we've held our own in terms of points of distribution, which has really allowed us to maintain that share and deliver growth. So I mean, that's why. Again, I just want to reiterate, the tone is not negative, Rob. The tone is very positive about Skippy and the things that we have going on, the pipeline of innovation; we feel really good about the business. Operator : And next we'll go to at Jeremy Scott with Mizuho. Jeremy Scott : I just want to ask about the other question. The advertising levels. I mean I know CytoSport is excluded from earnings guidance for the moment, but does your advertising guidance reflect the fact that business will be gone? I know you had plans to support sales in 2019 but presumably you no longer have any plans, marketing investments in the second half baked into your guides or is it all kind of rolled up into that three to five going number? Jim Snee : So, Jeremy, right now the guidance that we've given just assume business as usual. So everything is still in that number. When the deal closes, we will provide updated guidance and clarity or around the business. Jeremy Scott : Got it. Okay. On the refrigerated foods volume down 1%, first, is that an organic number? In other words, does that include the sales transfer from Jennie-O in the quarter? And if it is, can you unpack that number between the ongoing strategic harvest reductions and just the general demand environment? Jim Sheehan : Sure. Jeremy, the biggest cause of the reduction in sales had to do with the harvest production. And you are looking at life numbers, so both the prior year and current year have the adjustment of deli going into refrigerated foods. Just going into refrigerated foods. Jeremy Scott : Got it. Maybe just the last question, where are you with the $75 million in targeted savings and does the disposition of CytoSport change that guidance or change what you can achieve this year? Jim Snee : Not all that much. I mean, we're still on target and working diligently to attain it. I mean, we're committed to that target. A lot of what we said in Q4 still holds true in terms of -- there is some near-term and long-term solutions the team is working on. I think the one thing that -- what will really help our team and Jim Sheehan mentioned it in our prepared remarks is this; this project O'Ryan and really putting in technology to modernize and optimize not only supply chain HR but a number of our different operations. So that is really going to help the team as well, so we feel good where we are from a supply chain perspective. Operator : And next we'll go to Ken Zaslow the Bank of Montreal [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Just a follow-up on Rob's question; so in terms of Skippy side of it, you are going to hold steady and not react and focus more on brand building in innovation. Is that the expectation? Jim Snee : No, not at all. I mean from our perspective Ken, I mean we have to A) digest what we heard, you've got to understand how it's going to impact retailer by retailer and we will respond accordingly. And so could it be aligning price promotions, increased advertising, I mean there is a lot of things there; so the idea of that we're just going to stand Pat [ph] and hope for the best is not at all correct. So we will respond accordingly but we will do in what's in the best interest of our business. Unidentified Analyst : And you don't think the reaction is enough to change one way or the other way the outlook for your visitors. Is that a fair assessment? So basically, you say it is somewhat contained or that you can offset it with other parts of your business that would outperform; is that fair? Jim Snee : I mean, I think so. I think the other thing is -- this is still really early, and we need to understand exactly how this is all going to flow through on the customer side of the business. It's one thing to say you're going to have a price reduction, it's another thing to see how that actually plays out; is it reflected on shelves our margins just are captured. So there are lot of variables here that we have to be on the looking. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then my bigger [ph] question is; can you talk a little bit about innovation pipeline for this year. Which are the key areas within the business that you will see acceleration and where do you think you're kind of just doing more modest stuff? That would be helpful, thank you. Jim Snee : Yes, absolutely. I mean, so we've spent a lot of time and will continue to spend a lot of time on this -- the Skippy business, that's very important to us. We talked a little bit about the increased success that we're having an Applegate, and we're going to continue to spend our innovation focused there. A lot of work in our food service business; so we've had incredible success with a number of different items, and then we are spending time on our Justin's brand as well; so it's across a lot of our businesses. Some of the recent successes that we've had, we've talked about in our MegaMex portfolio with our Guacamole salsa, with natural choice snacks, stacks and wraps, I talked about Skippy with the launch of the PB&J minis; so these are items that are coming to -- that are in market but we've got robust pipelines backing up all of those brands, Ken. Operator : And next, we'll go to Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : So just to follow-up, two questions. First, in the refrigerated foods segment clearly you show that the segment profit was up nicely. Can you still quantify how much that had to do with the fact of being less integrated on the pork business and basically taking more advantage of the availability of fresh meat to put it into your prepared stuff into the bacon things and the Applegate products and so on? So that will be my first question. So how much of an impact did you see from having one plant left operated by yourself? Jim Sheehan : The Fremont impact in the first quarter was fairly neutral. So when you look at the sourcing cost on the carcass value compared to the prices that we were paid in the comp cost to operate; the impact was neutral, but I would say that one of the areas that we will see a longer term gain is the ability to focus on the value-added products and not having the resources tied up with that commodity operation. Benjamin Theurer : And then, one question I wanted to follow-up on the supply chain integration, the project you've been running. Can you update us on how you're doing there? Where you see maybe issues if you're on-track or not because I haven't found anything in your prepared remarks about the supply chain? You mentioned the project into technology and so on which has to do with it but an update of the status quo that would be much appreciated. Jim Snee : Sure, Ben. As I said a little while ago; I mean, we're on-track and committed to the target we provided on the fourth quarter call. We do think that project O'Ryan will be a technology catalyst to help our efforts as well, and it is, there is a number of short-term things that were working on, we continue to work on freight-related issues thinking about network optimization, maybe structural changes. So, I mean the team continues to be hard at work and really the bigger message is we're committed to the $75 million. Operator : And next, we'll go to Heather Jones with Vertical Group for a follow-up. Heather Jones : I just had two quick questions. Wondering, Jim Sheehan, you had mentioned earlier that on the Hog -- on the pork side, part of the traction was having some grain related Hog contracts. I was wondering, did you say there was a greater proportion of those this year versus last year or was it just how the impact fell out? I mean, I guess I'm trying to think as we go further in the year and the thought is that supplies will tighten up as the year progresses; do you still have significant exposure to the western corn belt or you're much more heavily weighted to grain base now? Jim Sheehan : Well, our exposure to the western corn belt and all of these contracts have decreased with the sale of Fremont. As we change the source of Hogs, as we close Fremont; there is going to be some short-term imbalance where we need some time to rebalance our contracts, as contracts come due and we renegotiate those contracts. So right now we have a heavier percentage of grain based contracts than we did last year at this time. And with the volatility that you've seen in the Hog prices, the grains obviously have not decreased in cost as the same rate as the Hog prices have, so that's creating the imbalance right now but we are actively managing our contracts right now that will adjust our supply base to a more balanced approach across all of those multiple formulas. Heather Jones : A more balanced approach similar to what you had last year pre-Fremont sale? Jim Sheehan : I would say pre-Fremont sales, I would -- the item that I'd take you to Heather is that it affects all of the free but -- the meat that we get out of Fremont is a carcass value; so we have to take that into account as we negotiate new contracts for Fremont or for Austin, I'm sorry. Heather Jones : Okay. And then my second follow-up was on the bacon business; it seems like I mean bellies have clearly been very weak and understandably we're starting to see more promotional pricing in that category at retail. But from what I understand, you guys tend to be more capacity constrained there. So do you have any -- what are your thoughts about how the category is getting more promotional -- like how do you intend to respond? Nathan Annis : Yes, I mean Heather we\u2019ve talked a little bit about categories and revenue growth management so it is all of those things with pricing and promotion and advertising. So I tell you in our bacon business is still very healthy; both on the retail and food service side. We referenced our food services business, Bacon 1 in our prepared comments but the expansion of that Wichita Kansas facility also opened up some capacity on the retail side of the business for us. So, from a capacity perspective we're in a good place and we clearly understand all of the category dynamic center managing it very effectively to be able to deliver continued growth in that space. Heather Jones : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : And next, we'll go to Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group for follow up. Eric Larson : One other quick question, thanks for the follow-up. It's really related to CytoSport and I know that, you know Pepsi obviously distributed -- control all the distribution into the convenience channel but I do believe that you would hope that, that acquisition would also give you more exposure on a way to leverage that C store channel and I do believe that you feel you're under indexed in that sales channel. So how do you think about that channel going forward -- that maybe you didn't you know really receive much benefit from that. But to get exposure there, will you need to acquire to get in there or I mean how does the C channel mile resonate with CytoSport you know exiting your portfolio? Jim Snee : Eric, I thank you know the convenience store channel in the service that Pepsi provided on the beverage side you know it was really going to be hard for them to take us anywhere else in the C store space. You know as we think about that channel, I mean we do quite a bit of business there on a number of different fronts you know we have our -- some of our mega mix portfolio is there in the grab and go space. C stores become more of an almost a traditional food service operator if you will. A number of our items with a number of customers are going into their commissaries to support that growth and we can do that through our food service organization. So between our food service organizations our efforts with our mega mix team. I mean we have an effort against the C store channel you're just not going to see Hormel products in the beverage cooler obviously but you know if you think back we did everything that we thought we were going to do when we acquired that business you know in terms of expanding distribution, did a really nice job with food, drug & mass. With innovation, what we did with our evolved brand with the bar business and in capturing synergies and then so what we did all those things I think that the bigger issue the key takeaway for us was that you know we didn't have control of that biggest part of that supply chain, so DST distribution and on the ready to drink manufacturing side. So really became more difficult to control your own destiny. And so we obviously evaluated our options and it's clear Pepsi's the best long term owner of that business so you know we have nothing to apologize for we feel really good about the business how we ran it when we had it and I think it'll be it'll be fun to see Pepsi really lean into that business now. Operator : And that concludes today's question and answer session I'll now turn the call back over to Nathan Annis for any additional or closing remarks. Nathan Annis : Yes, good morning. On behalf of the team here Hormel foods we want to thank all of you for joining us today and as always a big thank you to all of our team members around the globe for all of their hard work. With that on February 1, we were saddened by the news of the passing of Dick Knowlton, Former Chairman of the Board, President and CEO of Hormel Foods. We offer our deepest condolences to all of Dick's family, and want them to know that he will be remembered as a great leader, ambassador, and gentleman. Thank you for your time today. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. As a global branded food company, we remain focused on our long term strategy we call our formula for success. This includes building strong brands, developing innovative new items, making strategic acquisitions, and creating intentional balance. We had strengthened our competitive position in the past three years through intentional actions such as evolving through a broader global branded food company, accelerating our foodservice business, modernizing our supply chain and divesting non-strategic assets. Today these actions leave us with the better business, a strong balance sheet, insisting cash flows and the ability to make a transformational acquisition when the opportunity presents itself. Many of our businesses continued to exceed expectations and demonstrate our strategy is working. We\u2019ve recognized progress is not always linear. So we are focused on executing against our plans in the marketplace, while delivering the longer term results our shareholders expect. This morning we announced second quarter earnings per share of $0.52. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.46, a 5% increase compared to last year. Three segments delivered volume and sales growth resulting in a volume increase of 1% and sales of increase of 1%. There are many bright spots I want to highlight as we look at our top line results. First our foodservice business across the company had a very strong quarter, delivering mid single-digit sales growth. Products such as Hormel Bacon 1 cooked bacon, Hormel Fire Braised meat, Austin Blues authentic barbeque and Jennie-O foodservice business all delivered strong growth. Each year food service becomes more and more important to us as we find new and innovative products that deliver value to operators. Next our portfolio of grocery products had a solid quarter with growth coming from offering such as the SPAM family of products, Herdez salsas, SKIPPY peanut butter, Dinty Moore Stew, Black Label bacon beds and Hormel microwave meals. These brands, along with many others in our portfolio, continued to demonstrate growth is occurring in the center of the store. We issued record value added sales within refrigerated foods as we continue to convert lower margin commodity products into higher margin value added products. And that result is a double-digit decline in commodity sales and an increase in value added sales. Once again, this is consistent with the long term trajectory of refrigerated foods and reflects the clarity, focus and alignment this team exhibits. Looking at the segments. Grocery products had a strong quarter as sales increased 2% on a 3% volume increase. Segment profit increased 12% due to higher volume and margin across many of our brands, including SPAM and Dinty Moore, in addition to lower expenses for CytoSport. We completed the divestiture of CytoSport on April 15. During the quarter, we took a measured and calculated response to a competitor's price decrease in order to defend our SKIPPY peanut butter franchise. Our responsibility as a branded food company is to elevate the category through brand building and innovation. We believe competing on the basis of price alone is not how branded food company should operate. Throughout this process, our commitment to use revenue growth management techniques to optimize our promotional strategies has been very well received by our retail partners. We continue to be encouraged by our new Skippy PB&J Minis. Our market test was successful, and we are currently rolling out the product nationwide. In addition, our current pipeline of out of the jar innovation for nut butters is very robust. Refrigerated foods sales increased 1% on flat volumes. While segment profit declined, it was driven by a 65% decline in commodity profits and rapidly increasing input costs such as bellies and trim. Brands such as Hormel Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Austin Blues and Black Label all had an excellent quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the new Hormel Deli solutions division, especially the performance of the Columbus brands, and our prepared foods portfolio of products. Our Applegate and Natural Choice brands continued to grow as consumers look for better for you options that fit their lifestyles. International volume declined 7%, sales declined 9% and segment profit declined 31%. The key driver to the decline continues to be lower fresh pork exports volume and pricing caused by global trade uncertainty related to tariffs. We also experienced higher freight costs, primarily relating to flooding near Fremont, Nebraska, which affected our ability to ship export products. We saw continued growth in our China business led by key brands such as SPAM and Skippy. Jennie-O Turkey Store volume increased 2%, while sales were flat. We delivered growth in our foodservice business led by our Jennie-O slice Turkey products. Segment profit declined 45%, driven by start-up costs at our Melrose Hulbert plant, higher feed costs and lower retail sales. The Melrose plant is now the most automated production facility we own, and certain automation components are new to Hormel Foods and the industry. Within one week we switched from a highly manual plant to an automated plant and the process took more time than we expected picking up to full speed. The extremely cold weather compounded the problem as we were unable to move forward into the facility during certain days. The additional start-up cost this quarter was $0.01 earnings per share. We are now very close to hitting our efficiency targets, and expect lower net production costs in the years to come. The lingering effects of two voluntary recalls for lean ground Turkey during the first quarter led the loss retail distribution. Throughout the recall event, we have maintained a close watch on key brand health metrics and are pleased to report all measures show the Jennie-O brand is strong. Starting in the third quarter, we will reactivate promotional activity and advertising in order to gain back our loss distribution. We continue to work with the Turkey industry on the issue of salmonella. Our efforts across the entire supply chain have helped decreased levels of salmonella in our facilities. We have also maintained our leadership role of educating consumers on how to safely handle and prepare raw Turkey. From an industry perspective, we continue to see lower placements, but cold storage levels remain at elevated levels. Market prices are starting to show modest increases. As we think about our first half, excluding the onetime gain on the CytoSport divestiture, strong results from Grocery Products and favorable SG&A were offset by higher than expected plant start-up cost as Jennie-O Turkey store and margin compression in International and Refrigerated businesses. Overall, the business finished below our expectations for the first half. As we look forward, the biggest unknown in the protein industry is related to the outbreak of African swine fever in China. As I could take the opportunity to walk you through the dynamics of the African swine fever, our expectations the actions we are taking and the expected impact on our financial results. This will give you a deeper understanding of our business results and context for our guidance. First, the best industry information shows that China has lost between 150 million and 200 million hogs. This is equivalent to more than the entire pork production in the United States. In addition, China is the largest pork producer and consumer of pork in the world. Second, due to the losses of hogs in China, we have seen hog prices in China increased by approximately 28% during our second quarter. Prices will likely continue to move higher as cold storage stocks in China are drawn down. Finally, the United States will play a vital role in filling the global supply gap. In a response to the higher demand and increased exports, domestic prices have already increased and will likely increase further. We started to see the market effects of ASS in our second quarter. We saw rapid increases in key input costs for hogs, the USDA composite cut out, bellies and trim during the quarter. We expect all these markets to increase in the coming months. And Jim Sheehan will provide our high level assumptions for the markets during his comments. In response to these input cost increases, and the cost increases we expect to come, we announced pricing action on the majority of our pork-related products portfolio across Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and International. Depending on the category, our announced pricing generally takes 30 to 75 days to become effective on shop of the retail. As such, most pricing actions will be effective in the back half of the third quarter. Within foodservice, we're able to adjust pricing every two weeks, which allows us to stay closer to any market changes. Our prior experiences, such as with PEDB in 2014, suggest our brands can operate and grow in both low and high market conditions. However, the speed at which markets move can cause short-term margin expansion and compression as our prices lag input cost changes. Second quarter demonstrated this dynamic as near term margins were pressured. We expect similar periods of margin pressure as markets move higher in the back half of 2019. We do expect short term volume declines, but they will vary by category. We have taken proactive actions to maintain volumes such as adjusting our promotional activity, and shifting our advertising to support key brands. Once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to communicate directly with our customers on how ASF will affect our categories. Pricing discussions with customers are never easy, but finding the right solutions for our customers truly differentiates our company. Animal health issues are not new to us, in fact, this will be our third situation in the last five years. Each event comes with its own unique challenges and issues. ASF will be different than PEDV in 2014 and different than high path avian influenza in 2016. But the lessons we learned in those events will be important as we managed through ASF. I'm confident our experience management team will continue to guide our company forward and our dedicated team of employees will help deliver our key results. Turning to our guidance for fiscal 2019. Higher forecasted input costs and the lag in pricing are expected to impact Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and International earnings in the second half. We have also lowered our expectations for Jennie-O as we reinvest to gain back our retail distribution. Our guidance also includes a positive $0.02 net impact to the year for the divestiture of CytoSport. Taking all factors into account, we are lowering our full year guidance to $1.71 to $1.85 per share and our sales guidance to $9.5 billion to $10 billion. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and our earnings guidance in addition to key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Volume and net sales for the quarter grew 1%. Volume was 1.2 billion pounds as growth from Grocery Products and Jennie-O Turkey store offset the decline in International. The record sales of $2.3 billion was due to strength in Grocery Products and record value added sales in Refrigerated Foods. Net earnings for the second quarter were $282 million, up 19% from last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.52, adjusted earnings per share was $0.46, up 5% increase. The CytoSport transaction was closed April 15th. Gain was $0.06 per share and recognized a net unallocated expense and taxes. The second half impact earnings for 2019 is a reduction of approximately $0.04 per share. Full year sales for CytoSport were expected to be approximately $300 million. SG&A excluding advertising was 5.7% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. The decline was driven by the one-time benefit from the CytoSport sale and reduction in selling expense. Advertising for the quarter was $35 million, a decline from $37 million last year. Advertising investments are expected to be down modestly due to the sales of CytoSport. Operating margins were 13.3% compared to 12.9% last year. The increase was primarily due to lower SG&A and stronger results from grocery products. The effective tax rate was 11.1% down from 20% last year. The gain from CytoSport sales drove the decline. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be between 17.5% and 19.5%. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $366 million, down 18%. The decrease is due to higher levels of working capital, primarily from building inventory and anticipation of higher raw material costs. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $48 million compared to $87 million last year. We expect to spend approximately $310 million in 2019. Weather issues delayed the expansion of the Burke facility, which will shift capital spend into 2020. We paid the 363rd consecutive quarterly dividends, effective May 15 at annual rate of $0.84 per share, a 12% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases in the quarter were $23 million representing 562,000 shares. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on our internal valuation. We received $474 million from the CytoSport transaction. We used the proceeds to pay $375 million of short term debt related to the purchase of Columbus Craft Meats. Net debt is negative. Company remains in a strong financial position to fund strategic investments. Domestic hog supply and production are balanced. Industry expansion continues as global demand increases. The supply shortage in China, caused by African swine fever, should drive domestic prices higher. We expect to operate in a high cost and volatile environment for multiple quarters. Hog markets increase year-over-year, rising more than 50% throughout the second quarter. USDA composite cutout value increased 20%. The company\u2019s grain-based contracts and balanced approach to hog procurement provided some projection against the rapid market increases during the quarter. Prices for bellie and lean trim increased as much as 40% during the quarter before declining in the last few weeks. The guidance range for the remainder of the year is based on the following market expectations. The range reflects our view of the impact of ASF in China without an outbreak in the United States. We expect hog prices and the USDA composite cutout declined 10% to 30% from the current price levels, while maintaining a high level of volatility. The last time markets were at this level was 2014 during the domestic PEDV offering. Bellie prices have historically been the most volatile of our key inputs. We expect costs to rise to a new price range of 30% to 40% higher than the current range. Our guidance includes continued volatility within the expected range. Being trim markets are doubled from February to around $80 per 100 weight, we expect 10% to 20% increases compared to the current prices. Although there are various opinions on the impact of ASF on future pork markets, we feel providing our outlook provides better insight into our guidance. Turkey pork placements were down 4% from the last six months and down 5% year-to-date. Fresh meat and cold storage remains elevated, 7% above last year. Compared to last year, Turkey breast prices were up 28% and whole bird prices rose 6%. Meat cost was higher by 7% during the quarter. We continue to make excellent progress on Project Orion, a strategic initiative to streamline and transform how we operate as a global branded food company. This project will generate efficiencies across the entire company and represents the next step in the execution of our long-term growth strategy. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Michael Lavery from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Can you just give a little more color on your pricing actions relative to cost increases? And you said that it had cost increases and expected costs increases in line. You gave a little bit of color on what some of those expectations are. But how much are you leaning in on pricing? Would it color all of that? Would it more than color all of that? What\u2019s the right way to think about where you land from a margin standpoint? Jim Sheehan : Sure. I\u2019ll go ahead and start around pricing, and then I\u2019ll let Jim talk a little bit more about some of the market conditions. As we saw the run up in markets, in the second quarter, we were quick to react and took some very proactive pricing actions across the number of our key categories that\u2019s obviously are pork related. What was interesting in the quarter is we saw the quick run up and then we saw a moderation of pricing. And so when we say expected pricing going forward, we do project that pricing will return to the levels that we saw in Q2, in some cases maybe a little higher. The other thing to remember Michael, and we've talked about this a lot is that lag in pricing. So again depending on the channel foodservice little closer to the market, when you think about Refrigerated Products that\u2019s all further out, and then GP, Grocery Products are shall stable portfolio is really what takes the longest to be reflected. So we feel good about the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken. For us, it\u2019s really that volatility that creates the compression or in some cases expansion, but it\u2019s really getting to the new level. Once we get to a new level that becomes little more stabilized than that\u2019s when we get margins back to normalized level. So it\u2019s really the volatility that creates the disruption. And I\u2019ll turn over to Jim maybe for a little more market clarity. Jim Snee : Certainly. Michael, we expect to see volatility as these prices continue to grow. To give you an example of challenges, the belly market for instance in the second quarter had a low of 120 and a high of 215. And it wasn\u2019t a consistent line. You\u2019d see increases and then you see sudden drops and that creates a lot of difficulty in getting the timing of the pricing correct. We expect those challenges to continue. We expect that volatility for us to create a challenge in the pricing as we go forward. Michael Lavery : Even if it\u2019s volatile, you have, obviously, some visibility on costs. What about on the consumer side? Do you have a sense of their ability to bear further pricing? And what depending limits there are to where you start to see real meaningfully you left diseased, but -- and how may that compared to five years ago with the PEDV? Jim Sheehan : I think this is going to be a little bit difference in that PEDV. It was probably a more short-lived. I mean all the prognosticators are saying that this could be a little longer term. So I think there are some key learnings that are very applicable and there are some things that are little bit different. Any time you take pricing, especially in the short-term you do have an impact on volume. We\u2019re talking about a number of different categories. So the volume impact, the elasticities are very different across all of those categories. The most recent reference point we have, of course, would have been the fourth quarter of 2017, where we had a significant run up in key markets. And again, we put our elasticity models to work. And the good news is in many cases, we were able to outperform what was projected. But we've done all the homework and understand that there will be some volume implications as we take pricing. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : I appreciate, Jim the color on your outlook for the individual promos as well as your outlook on hogs. You alluded to some comments around duration, but with what you know now, what is the duration of volatility that you're expecting? And or for what period of time are you thinking about elevated price is sustaining? Jim Sheehan : Yes, I mean, that's part of the uncertainty that we're dealing with. There's a point of view that says you could see this being a multi-year event. And that's really what we're preparing for. But, I think in the short term, especially, it's really interesting how the dynamics and the information is changing so rapidly. So as we're talking to others in the industry, you hear points to view where the markets getting ready to run very soon. And then you talked to others who say, maybe freezer stocks in China are a little higher than anticipated and it's going to take some while to clear them. So there's really a lot of uncertainty around when, how much, how fast, how long, what happens in the competitive landscape, who decides to export, who is focused on value-added. So with all that uncertainty, we're giving you our best estimate. But we really want to focus on is the certainty and what we know to be true. And that's really our ability to price to new market level. And then, as always, we're going to do what's in the best interest of the company, the customers, consumers, food service operators. So we really need to focus on the things that we can control, and then really just do our best to try to understand the uncertainty that's in the marketplace. Ben Bienvenu : On the Jennie-O business, some operational challenges that you mentioned in the quarter, and some go-forward investment around regaining retail distribution. What does that timeline look like for getting back to some of those distribution points? And then, I'd love to hear kind of what you guys think about the Turkey outlook with a little bit more detail as well as kind of the magnitude of the cost of re-establishing those retail distribution points? Jim Snee : Sure. I mean it starts with the fact that the impact of the voluntary recall was that, that we lost distribution. The other thing that we've had to understand is what's happened with the brand and so what we know is that the brand strength is still very strong among consumers and where we have product on shelf, which is still quite expensive, because we're the number one brand, our velocities are good. The velocities haven't decreased at all. So obviously, having the number one brand really does matter. So as we think about the back half of the year, I mean we see this as an entire back half play in terms of regaining distribution, even though we have the number one brand, it doesn't happen overnight. And as you mentioned, there will be some impact with the investments that we need to make. But we feel confident that by reactivating promotional activity, really engaging with our advertising and going customer by customer. We're still very positive on the JOTS business. As we think back to this business where it come from, it's clearly the best performing acquisition, we've ever made, the combination of Jennie-O and Turkey Store. So we are not resting on our laurels or looking back, it's really about how we are going to carry this business forward. And we have some work to do, but when we gain -- when we regain the distribution, we know the brand is strong and we know that the velocities are there, in that lean ground space. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So, first on your cash balance. So clearly, it continues to build on the sale of CytoSport, so just curious how you guys are thinking about deploying that excess cash? Jim Sheehan : I think that the focus is the same and it\u2019s investing and growing the business. Jim Snee : Yes, Rupesh. And I would tell you, as we mentioned in our comments, that we're in a really good position, should we find obviously the right acquisition and we referenced a transformational acquisition. So we've talked about the level that of the size of the deal that we could do, we would be comfortable with, that still holds true. The key is, as always we've got a number of deals that we're looking at, that we're reviewing that are in the pipeline. It's getting them to the finish line. And then the other part is, in terms of having the one deal that fits that price range can sometimes be difficult. So as Jim mentioned, it is this constant view of how do we reinvest and grow in the business whether that's through value-added capacity expansion or through external strategic acquisitions. I mean, our team is as focused as ever on both of those. Rupesh Parikh : And then on the Refrigerated Foods segment, so there is another big decline in commodity profits. So I was just curious, if you can just give us a little more color on what's driving that decline and whether the company is now worse off or better following the Fremont plant sale? Jim Snee : Yeah I mean we're better off than we were three years ago. I mean, as we've said, this is a better business today. The moves that we've made to really strengthen our earnings power put us in a really strong position. The Refrigerated Foods piece is, it's the fifth consecutive quarter of steep declines in commodity profits and even though we had record value-added sales, it still wasn't enough to overcome that. And then, of course, to tell you the combination of the margin compression from the run-up in markets, but as we think about the portfolio, especially in Refrigerated Foods, I mean it is as strong as it's ever been and well positioned for future growth. Jim Sheehan : Rupesh, one area I'd point you to is that the hog markets increased about 50% year-over-year in the second quarter, where the composite carcass value, the basis of what we purchase from the WholeStone Group increased about 20%. So I think that's consistent with the strategy of reducing the level of volatility in this transaction. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : So I just want to discuss a little bit, you lowered the fiscal '19 guidance by $0.06. That includes a net $0.02 benefit from the CytoSport divestiture. So $0.08 kind of pre-that and I presume the corporate -- I mean, seems like corporate actually will light this quarter. So maybe the operations are little bit more than that. But can you allocate that the change in outlook to the businesses, if at all? Obviously the Jennie-O business has gotten more challenged and you've got the input pressures on pork that spread throughout the portfolio, but how should we think about the change in outlook by operating segments? Jim Sheehan : Well, Adam, I'll start on the discussion around that -- unallocated being down, it's down because of the CytoSport transaction, some benefit in the interest income, but it's also down because our general administrative expenses and some selling expenses, the amount that we've allocated to the businesses is less than what our actual spend is, it has to do with we allocate those expenses on a fixed amount based on our budgets and really we've done a very nice job of managing those expenses. So that's really a reduction and it's consistent with what you're seeing in SG&A, where you're seeing a reduction on our SG&A costs. Jim Snee : Yes, then as we think about the businesses, Adam, I mean, the key takeaway is that our first half was lower than expected, but the majority of that gap is in the second half due to ASF and the business at JOTS. So as you think about each segments, Grocery Products, will have a slight decline. As you think about higher trim markets and we haven't talked about the Skippy pricing yet, but that will have an impact in the second half of the year. For Refrigerated Foods, we expect continued strong results from our brands across all the channels, but there will be a lag in pricing. So we would expect to see a slight decline in Refrigerated Foods in the back half. And really the same holds true for International through the ASF and tariff issues. And then as we've talked about JOTS, because of the reinvestment in lean ground and we're still not seeing improvement in the markets like we'd like to see. So we are seeing some improvements, but they continue to be slow. So it's a little bit across the board and but the majority of the gap is in the back half. Adam Samuelson : And then, I guess my second question is more just about the competitive in the U.S. pork market. As we think about the prospect of higher pork exports, do you feel that puts you in any sort of competitive disadvantage where some of your bigger packer and processed meat competitors are a bit more vertically integrated and more tied to the export market, might have more visibility in terms of product flow before you fully see that is from thinking specifically in the event of the U.S exporting cold carcasses to China and the net impact that would have on belly and trim markets. But just broadly this does not having a bigger export business today put you at a competitive disadvantage given the market landscape? Jim Snee : Yes, what I would say that Adam is, you've got short-term issues and then long-term strategies. And so there are different operating models that will certainly be able to capitalize on some of those short-term opportunities, better than we can. But -- from where we sit, we're in the business we want to be and we know that there's going to be that volatility, less supply, increased costs, and as we've talked about, it's that lag that hurts us, that compresses us in the short term. But we know and we've demonstrated our ability to price to the new market levels with the businesses, the brands, the portfolios that we've chosen to participate in. And so advantage, disadvantage, I guess it really depends on the business you want to be in and how you want to run short term, long term, but we feel good about where we are. We just really need to get through the ups and downs of the markets and then we'll be fine. Operator : We'll take our next question is from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Jeremy Scott : If you can offer any color on how your customers in each of your channels are addressing the looming supply disruption. I think one thing we're hearing more from restaurant operators is that there's an elevated urgency to lock up price or even lock up volumes. So -- and then, I guess on the other hand, we're hearing how operators are adjusting menus and features toward other proteins. So I appreciate your comments on pricing elasticity and contract duration. But is there a risk of customers in anticipation of a shortage already making adjustments to their purchase behavior and maybe less willing to absorb a pricing action at this point? Jim Snee : Jeremy, we feel like we're pretty close especially to the foodservice market. And I will tell you that we have not seen that with our foodservice operators where others are thinking about substitution or trying to lock up supply. I think your -- the first part of your comment is very accurate that when you get into these situations. There is a propensity to want to try to lock up pricing and obviously from our perspective. We go the other way and say that's the last thing we want to do and we want to get closer to the market and that really is what we're able to do each and every day is our pricing in foodservices closer to the market. We have steered clear of long-term pricing agreements. We don't believe that they're actually in either party's interest. Our focus continues to be on creating solutions, right, making sure that we can help them with their pain points around creating great menu ideas for their patrons, making sure that we can help them with their labor, their insurance, their safety issues. So I'm not going to go so far as to say it's business as usual, because it's not -- there's certainly a different mindset. But a lot of what we're doing still plays out in the marketplace. Jeremy Scott : I appreciate the color you had on your expectations for raw material inflation. Just given all the internal changes in Refrigerated Foods division over the last couple years, I think there's been some hazing this in terms of your net sensitivity to different pricing. So maybe if I can ask on the cost side of the equation, meaning, assuming you take price, what is the earnings sensitivity to let's say a 10% increase in bellies and trim? Jim Sheehan : The answer that I would give you, Jeremy, as it's more about the volatility in the change, as opposed to the magnitude of the change. So as this process matures, I think you're going to see less volatility in the markets, will be less rumors because people understand the facts around ASF. Right now what's happening again is that you're just seeing wild swings day to day in the markets. Once we hit a level that there is more stability, there are less rumors or speculation going on. We'll be able to manage this fine. So the increase in the price is not the primary concern, it's how much volatility you're getting. For instance, we've seen I think from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter. I talked about the volatility in bellies. The price only changed 6% between the beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter. But as I said, the prices range between 120 and 215 in that quarter. That's difficult to manage. So my advice would be pay more attention to volatility, that's what's going to be -- sometimes it's a benefit and what volatility does it creates noise in a quarter. So for instance, if we've priced up and our input costs dropped the last two or three weeks, it may look -- may make the quarter look a little bit better than it really should or the other way around. Take a look at it on the long-term run as to how we're performing and somewhat ignore the noise of the quarterly movements because of volatility. Hopefully that's helpful. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : I appreciate all the comments about the volatility and the fundamental challenges, but I am a little confused as to your messaging here on your pricing because how decisive have you been able to be with your customers on these price increases that you've taken, like are you telling them that, hey, we're taking these price increases. But in a couple of weeks, we might have to take more based on our outlook or are you saying, hey, there's a lot of volatility. So this might not stick. It's a little unclear to me like how decisive you can actually be in how you're communicating to your customers? Jim Snee : Yes, that's a great question, Rob. And we have been very decisive with our customers in terms of the pricing that we've taken across multiple categories. Although there is all this uncertainty, again, as I said about the when, the how much, how long, there is a consensus that the markets are going to increase. And so we have been decisive with pricing, in terms of what the markets do and when it's reflected. We have gone a customer by customer and worked on a promotional basis to make sure that pricing is not negatively impacting the categories, but it's important to get that pricing out front and center as soon as possible. So the pricing actions have been decisive, working closely with them on a customer by customer basis as the markets move with that volatility is something that we watch very closely. So hopefully that gives you a little more color on how we're thinking about the pricing. Robert Moskow : Okay. And then in the grocery division, is it easier in the grocery division to kind of just take the price increase and have it stick because the underlying meat is a smaller component of the overall cost of the product. Is that a fair statement? Jim Snee : I wish it was. Robert Moskow : Wow, would you? Jim Snee : As you know -- we know the pricing conversations are always hard. And so I wouldn't say that it's any easier. It is a smaller component, you're correct. But you've got to have the market data or the industry facts to support your case. And I think that's really I would say that they're fairly equivalent in terms of Grocery Products or Refrigerated Foods. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : So couple of questions. One is, when I think about 2020, how much of the turkey issues will be resolved that you will be able to enjoy whatever recovery there is by 2020? And why would you not have any benefit from African swine fever from -- in the turkey operation in 2020? And then my second question would be, when I think about your pricing on the Skippy side, how much elasticity have you had and where do you expect that to go? Jim Snee : So great questions, Ken. As we think about 2020, you're right, I mean we should see the benefit of a couple of things, one, we will be working hard in the back half of this year to regain that distribution, knowing we have a strong brand, strong velocities. So the retail business, we should be able to see that or as you said, enjoy the positive impact. The foodservice business at Jennie-O Turkey Store had a good quarter and we expect that business to continue to grow and perform well. And then I think your last point on turkey is a very good one also. And we just -- it's hard to project, right. I mean, I do think there is a school of thought that says, if you have the impact of pork, there are going to be other proteins, chicken, beef, turkey that will benefit. So I mean we haven't modeled a lot of that into our back half, just because we know that we have work to do to regain that distribution, but certainly that's a wild card as we think about the impact of African swine fever. And then on the pricing for Skippy, we've taken a price decline and we -- we've worked customer by customer, because our ultimate goal is really to be great stewards of the category. And so we've worked and been very reliant on revenue growth management to help retailers, still try to grow the category. And our focus is continuing on the brand building and innovation, but it's a battle right now, it's a battle in the category. And again, we don't like the idea of competing solely on price. We want to focus on the brand building and innovation. So we're fighting. We've got a great brand and we've got some great things in the pipeline coming to take peanut butter out of the jar. We talked in our prepared comments about being pleased with the Skippy PB&J minis and our ability now to roll those out nationwide. Certainly, that will have a positive impact on the brand. So again, some short-term things that we'll work through, but we know that we'll come out the other side stronger and better. Operator : We'll take our next question is from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : My questions are actually -- my two questions are related. So just -- you talked about what your outlook is for hog and belly pricing et cetera for the rest of this year. I just want to think about 2020, you mentioned the 150 million to 200 million hogs, that conventional wisdom as has been lost in China and just that magnitude far surpasses PED. So I was just wondering when you're thinking -- in your early thinking about 2020, would you expect hog prices to take another big leg up then? And if you thought about the elasticity, the volume elasticity on your products, it's become clich\u00e9. But I mean, I think most would agree that this is unprecedented. So like, just wondering how you're thinking about how that affects volume et cetera and your business, when you have to pass on those that magnitude of cost increases? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean you've asked the question, I think a lot of ways to answer it, Heather, is that, we're in some unprecedented or we expect to be in some unprecedented areas for a longer period of time, than we've seen. And so you certainly -- if demand stays static, you could, to your point, see another run-up in prices. But I do think at a certain level, because of the elasticity and you're going to have demand destruction, or you know to Ken's earlier comment, you're going to have this migration to other proteins. So there's just -- there's so much uncertainty in terms of how you're going to have this interaction with the consumer across other proteins. It's really hard to project, what those ultimate impacts are going to be. Heather Jones : And I was wondering if you could -- if you could compare and contrast. You mentioned that you've been through three health events in the last five years and PED seems to be the most relevant to this one. Since your business has changed fairly substantially, you've divested Farmer John's, you've divested Fremont, but given your Jennie-O business, and then given your less control, I guess for lack of a better word of the hogs. Do you view the business as better positioned relative to '14, because you don't control the hogs, so you're more exposed to the belly cut-out et cetera, but you're less exposed to the lean -- the run in lean hogs? So just wondering if you could just give us some color on how you're thinking about how the business is positioned relative to '14? Jim Snee : The business in our opinion for where we want to be is much better positioned, because our goal is not to be a commodity company or commodity organization. And as I've said several times already, this is a better business today through the intentional changes that we've made. Some of the things we're talking about are short term and commodity in nature. Going back to the first part of your question, in terms of what have we learned and clearly from PEDV, what we learned was how important it is to be proactive with your pricing. And so, I mean, I would say that we certainly have led the charge in the industry in terms of being proactive with our pricing. But I think that's important, just because it gets the right mindset into the marketplace and then as things change, we've got other levers we can pull to help customers and consumers, but when it's all said and done, this company, this portfolio is in a much better place than it was in 2014. And as I've said pretty broadly within our four walls is I've never had as much confidence and as much faith in our business, our strategy and our people. Operator : We'll take our next question from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : I just have a couple. The first one is as a quick follow-up to Rob's question. In that you're quite a bit closer to the market with your foodservice business, does that allow you to adjust prices downward as well, if the market volatility would suggest to you should do that? I think that's a harder plan to implement at retail. But do you have flexibility to work with your customers on the downside as well? Jim Snee : Yes, Eric, that's a correct assessment. The foodservice channel does give us that flexibility, but it's also very typical. So because we're closer to the market, we take the ups and downs and that's clearly understood in the channel and in the marketplace. Eric Larson : Okay. Then the final two things are kind of second derivative calls here. You've been very proactive with your pricing in the market. Your competitors are facing the same issues. So are they thought -- are they with you on that? And then equally more important or as important, what are your hogs producers telling? Are they -- is the farming community gearing up to increase production as well? You've got low -- you've got low grain prices, you have this supposed big increase in demand coming, and that's all expectations at this point. But has it changed the way the producers are thinking about what they're going to do for the next couple of years as well? Jim Snee : Eric, I'll take the first part and then Jim Sheehan can answer the second half. As I said and you agreed, I mean we have been proactive with our pricing and we were the first ones out of the gate. We are starting to see some competitive follow-up, which obviously supports our position and help support the overall pricing models. So it's happening slower than we would have liked. But it's starting to happen. Jim, I'll let you answer. Jim Sheehan : Yes, I'll speak that. Our producers appear to be in a very good position to meet any demand for increased hog production. We feel that they're in a very good position and we're confident that we will have the supply of hogs if any. Operator : We'll take our next question from Thomas Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Just wanted to ask on the Jennie-O side, the lost shelf space, who are you losing that to and as you look to win it back, what's kind of the pitch for displacing it? It's a little surprising. I guess how well velocities have hung in to see this level of distribution losses. So what are your retailers telling you? Who are they giving it to and kind of what's the pitch to win it back? Jim Snee : Yes, I mean, there obviously are other competitors that are filling that space. And so it again depends on the retailer who's filling the void. The pitch becomes -- what happened to their category, since we've been gone. And in most cases, it's not a good category story for them and so to us that speaks volumes that : a, brand still matter, and b, the number one brand really matters. So there is a reason -- through the voluntary recall. There is a reason that we are off shelf and we understand that. But this idea that the brand is still strong through all of our research is very important. The idea of those places where we didn't lose distribution that the velocities are still hanging in there is very important. So it really becomes all of those things that the story that we're telling to the retailers. But again, it doesn't happen overnight. You don't show up with a magic wand and you're back on shelf. We know that we have to earn the right to be back on their shelves and we'll do that. But once we're there, we know that we'll be able to help them grow their category. Thomas Palmer : And I also wanted to follow-up on the hog side, you referenced the run-up in spot pricing. I think in the past you've had maybe a little bit less volatility than spot pricing because you're in negotiated pricing in your hedges. Have you decreased that exposure? I mean is this a situation where as those hedges roll off? We look for more inflation inside of the fourth quarter than in the third quarter or should we be thinking about it a little differently than that? Jim Snee : Probably, the biggest difference you've seen between the first quarter and second quarter and we believe will go into the back half is in the first quarter grain-based contracts were a drag to us. They were more expensive than other formula pricing that we had. It's an advantage to us right now. Those are coming in a little bit lower costs. We still take future positions. We still work with our producers. Of course, when we made the change in the structure of Fremont, we took a look at rebalancing the type of contracts we have and we think we're in a really good position right now. We have a nice balance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Just a quick one. So, obviously, with the disruption in China, roughly $150 million to $200 million, which you expect and your exposure on the sales side, what have you seen on Chinese demand for different products? Have you seen people switching? Have you still seen the similar demand dynamics as in the past? Sorry I'm little tired. Just to understand how the Chinese consumers reacting and how you feel about demand going forward on the Chinese side, just in order to understand a little bit what the opportunity could be for imported products from ours and how that most likely is going to shake out on a global basis? That would be great to get some color. Jim Snee : Yes, great question, Ben. So I mean we have seen and you've probably heard that there has been an increase in the chicken consumption in China. But consumers in China are still eating pork and so our in-country business still remains very strong both the retail and foodservice refrigerated meat business. We've also seen and as we mentioned, the strong growth in our SPAM and Skippy business, but I do think that, you hit on something that we're watching very closely is that we are trying to understand the consumer demand and what the impact of ASF is having on them at this point. We haven't seen it flow through in the business, but it is something obviously that's top of mind. Benjamin Theurer : And then just one quick one on your updated tax guidance, is it fair to assume that the second half is basically unchanged to what the initial guidance was, and that reduction for full year is solely driven by the lower effective tax rate of the second quarter? Jim Sheehan : That's correct, Benjamin. Operator : We will take our last question from Rebecca Scheuneman from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rebecca Scheuneman : So I was just wondering if you can talk about what percentage of the international business pork exports are? Is that less significant now with the Fremont sale? And I'm just wondering if that will help offset some of the cost pressures we're seeing in the port business because some of the other pork producers are seeing increased margins year-over-year in their pork export business? Jim Snee : Yes, so a couple of things there, Rebecca. Our transaction with the Fremont facility really has no impact on our ability to supply the international export pork business. I mean, it's still an important part of the overall portfolio. And so when it's down to the extreme that it was this quarter, it impacts the overall business and so obviously we've been in a very intentional, very focused on our ability to grow our multinational businesses, both in China and Brazil. And so we, of course, we've got our plant expansion, our new plant in Jiaxing to support that growth in country put in our first ever SPAM production line that we own outside the United States. And so, I mean that's really what we're focused on in terms of our international business and over time our goal is for our pork exports to become less and less meaningful, and less and lesser part of our international business. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. So you don't expect that a material impact your results for the back half of the year even as those margins improve, it really won't impact anything? Jim Sheehan : I mean it depends, right. And obviously we've got the impact of ASF but you've also got tariff issues still. I mean, there's still a lot of moving parts. So it could still have an impact on our international group. But again, it's really hard to tell at this time. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to today's presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, I want to thank all of you for your participation today. Obviously, we've covered a lot of ground and talked a lot about the uncertainty that exists in the marketplace. But through all of the uncertainty that exists in the marketplace, as I mentioned earlier, I've never had more confidence and faith in our team, our business and our strategies and their ability to continue to deliver key results for our company. I want to wish you all a safe Memorial Day weekend. And thank you for your time today. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that during our call, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic volume and organic sales. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you Nathan. Good morning everyone. Hormel Foods is an uncommon company, unique in our industry. We have a tenured management team who is able to quickly adjust to dynamic and volatile market conditions, a balanced portfolio of branded products sold through the retail, food service, deli and international channels, a direct sales force that is able to build and maintain relationships to help our customers grow their businesses, a reputation for bringing industry-leading innovations to the marketplace, and an increasingly agile and efficient supply chain.  Our financial position and business fundamentals remain strong. This enables us to deliver growth organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our leadership position as a global branded food company allows us to take a long-term perspective as we navigate near-term uncertainty related to the various market conditions. Our third quarter results demonstrate many of the qualities that make us uncommon. This morning we announced earnings per share of $0.37, a 5% decrease compared to last year but in line with our expectations. The decline in earnings per share was driven by a higher tax rate. Pre-tax profits grew 1% as excellent results from refrigerated foods offset declines from grocery products. Net sales declined 3% due to the divestiture of CytoSport. On an organic basis, sales were flat on a volume decline of 1%. Looking at the segments, refrigerated food sales increased 1% on a volume decline of 1%. Segment profit increased 13% driven by higher value-added profitability. Lower operational costs and higher commodity profits played a smaller role in the profit improvement. Refrigerated foods achieved record third quarter net sales, value-added sales, segment profit, and value-added profit. This was quite an accomplishment by the refrigerated foods team. Our Hormel food service division had another solid quarter. The team continues to leverage their direct sales organization to grow brands such as Hormel Bacon 1, Hormel Fire Braised, Natural Choice, Fontanini, and Old Smokehouse. I remain impressed with the innovation this team continuously delivers to the food service industry. They are also making excellent progress filling the new capacity for precooked bacon and Fontanini products. We remain very confident in our ability to grow the Applegate brand. Our food service team is making great progress growing Applegate with healthcare providers, colleges and universities. These operators appreciate the point of difference the Applegate brand provides for the needs of their patrons. For example, the Applegate Blend burger is filling a need in the college and university segment as students look for more ways to enjoy natural and organic alternative protein products.  The new Hormel deli solutions division continues to pursue its vision of helping retailers create the deli of the future. While the Columbus brand and our prepared foods portfolio of products are showing solid growth, the lower margin behind-the-glass category continues to decline. Consumer preferences are changing as shoppers are looking for more convenient options such as grab-and-go products like our Hormel Gatherings party trays and our authentic line of Columbus charcuterie. While this shift away from the behind-the-glass category presents a near term challenge to sales volume, I\u2019m confident the ongoing shift benefits the consumer, the retailer, and our company over the long term.  As category leaders, we took price increases across many of our branded value-added products when we started to see sharp increases in input costs. During the third quarter, we were priced high relative to others in many retail categories which created higher elasticity than we would typically expect. When higher input costs did not materialize as forecasted, we realigned our pricing to more closely match the commodity market. Once again, refrigerated foods has demonstrated an ability to generate growth in volatile market conditions. The long term growth of this segment continues to be driven by value-added products, disciplined pricing, and a clear focus on innovation. While we have seen how rapid changes in input costs can create noise in its quarterly results, the clarity, focus and alignment refrigerated foods demonstrates will continue to deliver sustainable growth. Grocery products volume declined 10% while sales declined 11%. Organic volume in sales increased by 1%. Segment profit declined 30% year-over-year due to the divestiture of CytoSport, higher avocado costs for our Holy Guacamole business, and lower earnings from our Skippy peanut butter spreads business.  Similar to what we experienced in 2017, avocado costs increased by over 100% during the quarter. A smaller California crop and strong global demand are driving the avocado market prices. In response, the MegaMex team is actively managing promotional tactics and will be evaluating pricing as the new crop is harvested during September. As always, we continue to focus on growing the Holy Guacamole brand through effective brand building, advertising and innovation. Our Skippy spreads business was negatively impacted by the price decline we took last quarter in response to a competitor\u2019s deflationary pricing. While we are disappointed in the category dynamic, we remain focused on building the Skippy brand through revenue growth management, effective advertising, and continued innovation. A key reason for acquiring the Skippy brand was to deliver out-of-the-jar innovation to the category. The recent launch of Skippy PB&Jelly Minis has been met with great retailer and consumer acceptance. This innovative item sold in the frozen section is versatile, portable, and perfect for today\u2019s busy families. We have now reached national distribution and trial and repeat rates continue to improve. I\u2019m very optimistic about the success of this product line. While Skippy spreads and Holy Guacamole had a difficult quarter, the balance of the grocery products portfolio performed well. Many of our center store brands such as Spam, Dinty Moore, Herdez, Black Label Bacon Bits, and Hormel Compleats all had a great quarter. I fully expect all of these brands will show growth for the full year. Jennie-O turkey store volume decreased 4% while sales decreased 5%. Segment profits declined 9% due to lower value-added sales. As we discussed last quarter, we are reactivating promotional activity to gain back lost retail distribution. While we continue to lap distribution losses, we have had a few small wins. We expect the process of regaining distribution will go well into 2020. Over the last few months, we have made changes to the Jennie-O organization to bring in several experienced leaders from other parts of the company who are charged with restoring growth through new and bold ideas for this business. From an industry perspective, we continue to see lower JOTS placements but cold storage remains at elevated levels. Turkey market prices have not materially changes since last quarter. International volume and sales were flat. Organic volume and sales increased 2% while segment profit was up 1%. Our team in China delivered strong results driven by our food service business in addition to growth from the Skippy and Spam brands. Exports continue to be affected by global trade uncertainty related to African swine fever and tariffs.  Similar to the prior quarter, the uncertainty in the protein industry is related to the outbreak of African swine fever. On our second quarter call, we discussed our view that commodity markets would start to increase on higher demand for pork from China. While we have not seen consistently higher prices, we have seen higher volatility and expect that trend to continue. As we evaluate the global impact of African swine fever, we are still confident that pork markets will eventually increase. At the appropriate time, we will take the necessary price increases to manage our profitability, which may create short term margin compression as pricing generally lags input cost increases.  Taking all factors into account, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance of $1.71 to $1.85 per share. We are also reaffirming our sales guidance of $9.5 billion to $10 billion but expect to be on the lower end of the range given market prices have not increased as we previously expected. I have confidence in our teams\u2019 ability to adjust to the changing market conditions and deliver our full year outlook. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and our earnings guidance, in addition to key assumptions for the remainder of fiscal 2019. Jim Sheehan : Thank you Jim. Good morning. Net sales for the third quarter were $2.3 billion. Organic sales growth in three of the four business segments was offset by declines at Jennie-O turkey store. Pre-tax earnings were $261 million, up 1% from last year. Net earnings were $199 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.37, down 5% due to a higher effective tax rate.  The significant increase in the tax rate was driven primarily by lapping the one-time gain from re-measuring the deferred tax liability last year. The tax rate was higher than we anticipated because of the lower volume of options exercised in the quarter. The full year tax rate is now expected to be between 18.3% and 20.3%, up from the previous estimate of 17.5% to 19.5%. SG&A excluding advertising was 6.5% of sales compared to 7.3% last year. The decline was due to the impact of the CytoSport transaction and lower employee-related expenses.  Net unallocated expense declined $10 million driven by lower interest expense and universal stock option expenses in the prior year. Advertising for the quarter was $32 million, down from $40 million last year. Advertising investments are expected to be lower primarily due to the sale of CytoSport. Operating margins were 11.2% compared to 10.9% last year. Strong results in refrigerated foods and favorable SG&A led to the improved performance.  Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $573 million, down 23%. The primary driver was increased levels of working capital as we build inventory in anticipation of higher raw material costs. This thoughtful approach to building inventory should mitigate some of the input cost volatility as markets rise. For the quarter, capital expenditures were $67 million compared to $103 million last year. We expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2019. Weather delays and changes in project scope impacted the projected capital spend.  We paid the 364th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $0.84 per share, a 12% increase over the prior year. This completes our 91st year of consecutive dividends. Share repurchases in the quarter were $107 million, representing 2.7 million shares. We will continue to repurchase stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises and based on our internal valuation. Our balance sheet remains strong and allows us to fund strategic investments to grow the business.  Fundamentals in the turkey industry are mixed. Bolt placements are down 4% year-to-date. Breast meat and cold storage is above last year and the five-year average. Turkey prices remained above $2 for the quarter, a 10% increase from last year. Whole birds were $0.07 above the prior year but remain below the five-year average. Feed costs for the quarter were similar to last year. Avocado prices are expected to decline through October but remain above last year. We will have better visibility as the Mexican crop is harvested in the next few weeks.  Pork input costs in the third quarter did not dramatically increase as we forecasted last quarter. Cold storage reserves in China, uncertainty caused by global trade dynamics, and robust hog production likely contributed to lower markets. The USDA cutout traded between a wide range of $72 and $89 per hundredweight during the quarter, never reaching our forecasted level. Hog markets exhibited similar behavior, trading between $68 and $85 per hundredweight. Belly prices for the quarter were significantly below the forecast, trading in a $49 range between $127 and $176 per hundredweight. Trim briefly met the forecasted highs before dropping 40%.  The third quarter clearly demonstrated our teams\u2019 ability to manage through extreme volatility in pork commodity markets to deliver results in line with our expectations. The guidance for the fourth quarter assumes higher prices for our key inputs with potential for volatility like we experienced in the past quarter. The overall fundamentals still support a sustained high cost environment in pork markets beginning as soon as the fourth quarter due to African swine fever. Hog supplies in China, Southeast Asia, and now regions in Europe are being affected. The exact timing and magnitude of the impact remains uncertain. We will provide a detailed view of market assumptions and the outlook for fiscal 2020 on the November call. We are making significant progress on Project Orion and our One Supply Chain initiative. For example, we are in the process of opening two new distribution centers in the coming months. On a combined basis, we will save over 3 million miles in our grocery business alone. Project Orion will unlock more opportunities for cost savings similar to this project. The team is focused on implementing major phases related to finance, HR, and supply chain during fiscal 2020.  At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the Operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. First, as we look at SG&A here, down nearly 15% this quarter, I was just hoping to better understand what the SG&A expense run rate was ex-CytoSport, what\u2019s driving that performance and how you\u2019re thinking about the expense opportunities going forward. Jim Sheehan : Good morning. We think that the run rate will be generally lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year primarily because of the CytoSport sale. Erica Eiler : Okay. Then given a lot of moving pieces in your business, from CytoSport to Skippy, Jennie-O, African swine fever, just wondering if there are any early thoughts you can provide on fiscal \u201920 at this juncture. Any puts or takes we should be thinking about would be helpful. Jim Snee : Yes, it is early for 2020 given the uncertainty and the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the markets, but as we think about all of the different business segments, refrigerated foods continues to be very well positioned and they\u2019ve demonstrated their ability, their long term ability to grow in volatile markets across food service, deli, retail. Grocery products, although we had some noise in the quarter with avocadoes, we remain positive on many, many of the brands, and of course we could have some input pressure there but I think the longer term brand story and the insight-led innovation have us poised for growth. JOTS continues to be a work in progress, as I said in my prepared comments. We\u2019ve had some small wins but we do expect the recovery to spill over well into 2020. We think the business is stabilized and now we do need to get back to growth.  International is obviously a wild card, uncertainty based on African swine fever and tariffs, but we\u2019re optimistic about the business that we have in China. We feel like we can reflect pricing to accommodate any of the input costs that we have, and then also the Spam and Skippy businesses that we\u2019ve developed are very strong.  Then any conversation about our business has to finish with a strong balance sheet, so we are poised for M&A. We\u2019re always ready to make acquisitions when the time is right. But it\u2019s early for 2020 given some of the uncertainty in the marketplace, but we are confident in our ability to grow over the long term. Erica Eiler : Okay great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : Thank you, good morning. I want to ask a clarifier question about the guidance for this year. Jim, you said that you expect full year sales guidance to be towards the lower end of the range. The earnings guidance for 4Q is quite wide. Would you expect EPS guidance to reflect your commentary on the sales guidance? Jim Snee : No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair assumption, Ben. I think from a top line perspective, it is how we\u2019re pricing, and as we mentioned the prepared comments, as markets did not materialize the way we thought, we did realign pricing in the quarter to make sure that we remained in very competitive positions. I think the sales guidance is one thing and it is different from the earnings guidance. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. A follow-up on the pricing. Can you help us think about how you think about using trade promotion spend to reduce the pricing increases that you had put in place versus actual list price reductions, particularly in an environment where input costs are as volatile as they\u2019ve been over the last several months? Jim Snee : The interesting thing is it is unique and different retailer by retailer, and we\u2019ve talked about that over the last several quarters, about how that\u2019s important to engage our direct selling organization with the customers to understand what the optimal solution is for their customer base. We do move promotional dollars or trade dollars around to make sure that we\u2019ve got them priced properly on a net basis. We work closely, of course, to make sure that the shelf price is reflective of where it needs to be, but again depending on the situation, we\u2019re willing to invest the trade dollars but it is a customer by customer decision. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, thanks. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research LLC. Heather Jones : Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to a comment you made about raw material, I think you were talking about cash flow, use of cash. I was just wondering if you could flesh that out more, which segments are you building raw materials, and any practical limitations. I mean, do you have the capacity to build substantial raw material inventories that could cover portions of 2020 or is it more limited to a quarter? Just wondering if you could help us understand that more. Jim Sheehan : Certainly. The inventory\u2019s really being built in the refrigerated, GP and international areas. Are there limits? Yes, there\u2019s a supply limit as to how much you can build inventory. We take a look at the trends that we believe are going to take place and we build selectively in certain commodities and certain finished goods. Heather Jones : Okay, thank you. My next question is on Jennie-O. You mentioned that the recovery is going to spill over into 2020. In your efforts to regain distribution, I would assume you have to be somewhat sharper on price. I was wondering, is the anticipation that that would be only for a year or so, or how long do you think you would have to lock into pricing to regain the distribution? Basically, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what kind of lag could we see in Jennie-O recovering with broader protein markets over the next year or so. Jim Snee : I think as we said, Heather, this does remain a distribution issue. Our velocities where we\u2019re in distribution remain very strong. We have had some small wins, as I said in my prepared remarks, so we are gaining some momentum. We\u2019ve turned on advertising in select markets and we\u2019ll have the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness before expanding.  I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have brought in some additional experienced sales and marketing leaders from other parts of the organization to really jumpstart that business, but it\u2019s still going to take time, so as we\u2019re thinking about it, it\u2019s probably going to be mid-2020. You\u2019re right - there are some investments that have to be made to regain distribution, but we\u2019re prepared to make those investments and really, the big thing is that we do feel like this business is stabilized and it is time for us to get this business back to growth. Heather Jones : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just digging a little bit more into the outlook for the fourth quarter, it is a wide range on the earnings side. Jim, I appreciate the comments that the sales and earnings don\u2019t necessarily align at the lower end of the range, but just help me understand the range of outcomes that get you towards the low and high end of the range. Presumably the bigger variable is pork raw material costs, but just help me think about the range of outcomes you\u2019ve laid out in your outlook. Jim Snee : Sure. You hit it right on the head, Adam - it is all about the input costs, and that will impact pricing and of course the elasticity that comes along with the pricing moves. If we get some additional false positives like we had in the second quarter, that could be problematic, but the run-up in input costs, as you know, it does create that short term margin compression. But we\u2019ll be aggressive with our pricing as category leaders, that\u2019s what we do, but we know that pricing does lag the input costs. You\u2019ve hit it right on the head - that is going to be the primary driver for that range, and we do believe that the range is warranted given some of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I was hoping to understand a little bit more, digging into 2020 the things that are in your control. Maybe on Project Orion specifically and some of the supply chain initiatives, can you quantify how much those actually benefited the quarter on a net basis, how much they\u2019re benefiting 2019 on a net basis or what your run rate exiting the year looks like, to think about potential savings into 2020 before we then layer on a sales or raw material input cost view? Jim Snee : Sure. If we go back to my earlier comments starting with the segments, from a 2020 outlook, the food service business continues to be hitting on all cylinders. We feel really good about the belly business, the retail business, whether it\u2019s our Hormel retail business, the Applegate retail business. We\u2019re optimistic about all of them. We know that there could be some of that short term noise, that margin compression as a result of input costs, but refrigerated foods has really been on a nice run and we expect that to continue. Grocery products, the work that the team has done there around brand building with center-of-the-store brands has been really, really impressive. We do think that the avocado crop that\u2019s coming in, we\u2019ll have a better read on that, probably some more favorable input costs that will give us some relief there. That\u2019s outside of our control, but what\u2019s in our control is our ability to make sure that we\u2019re building that brand through promotion and advertising and innovation, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We do feel good about grocery products. Probably the one that\u2019s outside of our control the most will be international, based on what happens with African swine fever and tariffs and really the global trade uncertainty. Part of it is in our control with our ability to run our business in China, but there are going to be some market impacts. Then the JOTS piece is going to be in our control and our ability to execute the business, or execute distribution gains. We\u2019ve got to get that done, continue to get that done in the fourth quarter and into 2020.  From a supply chain perspective, we\u2019re not going to get into the 2020 outlook for that, but we\u2019re committed to the savings number that we gave this year, the $75 million. We\u2019ve had a lot of success with a lot of projects. We referenced in Jim Sheehan\u2019s comments the fact that we\u2019ve got our new grocery products DC opening that will save us 3 million miles, and there is a corresponding financial benefit. We\u2019re evaluating our refrigerated foods network, and we\u2019ve had a better global view of plant for performance. So there is a lot of benefits that we\u2019ve seen from not only our One Supply Chain but Project Orion, and we expect that to continue over the next several years. Adam Samuelson : If I could just sneak one quick follow-up, the capex reduction for this year, there was some timing but there\u2019s also allusion to project scope changes. How much of that, I think it was a $100 million reduction, really comes in next year versus the actual cost of the programs or the projects goes down? Jim Snee : The majority of that is timing. We had a really wet spring here in the midwest and we\u2019ve got a very big project going on at Burke, so that\u2019s shifted some of those expenses back. But the one thing I want everyone to know is that there is not a lack of commitment. Our commitment to capex spending and investing in our value-added business is as strong as it\u2019s ever been. Adam Samuelson : Okay, I appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, to join the queue it\u2019s star, one on your telephone keypad. Next, we\u2019ll go to Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Eric Larson : Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Either Jim can answer this question. We\u2019ve seen a lot of hog supplies on the market, particularly June and July, etc., and again a lot of volatility with lean hog pricing. My question is have farmers anticipated ASF? Do you think there\u2019s been expansion in the herd industry because of ASF or not? What might be some of the dynamics that you see going on? Obviously we\u2019ve got corn prices back down sharply as well, soybean meal as well, but what might be the mentality for hog expansion that we see out there for the next 12 months, and what\u2019s happened recently, do you think? Jim Sheehan : Well, I think some of it is a reaction to the additional hog processing capacity that\u2019s in the industry right now, and anticipating that capacity increasing, they\u2019ve increased their production. We certainly do see that hogs today are about $70. They\u2019re a relatively cheap input. There\u2019s cheap input, as you said- the grain is at a low cost basis right now, so I think there are encouragements to increase the hog production. It\u2019s in line with what expectations were, but I think probably the biggest driver was that there\u2019s been probably two years or more of discussion about the additional capacity coming online. They\u2019ve had time to react, and those hogs are available to us. Eric Larson : Okay. Then just a broader follow-up, it\u2019s to your comments, Mr. Snee--Jim, about your supply chain efforts. It\u2019s a multi-year project, so you\u2019ve quantified what you thought your supply chain savings would be this year. Without getting into specifics, this something that is a multi-year project, is there a way to try to quantify what that might be, or are you in a position you can talk about that? Jim Snee : I think when we get into our fourth quarter call, we\u2019ll obviously give a little more color and clarity. The other variable as we continue down the path with Project Orion, we\u2019ll have more opportunities that will reveal themselves. But the part about this being a multi-year project, I don\u2019t even know if I would refer to it as a project. This is a permanent part, a permanent structure that we have in our organization that we\u2019ve needed. I cited a couple of specific examples. As we think about just having that global view of plant performance, better meat utilization, and even some of the softer things about how we\u2019re better prepared to approach training and recruitment in an environment where workers are harder than ever to come by, it\u2019s important that we have one standard approach to how we\u2019re doing things, so the benefits of the One Supply Chain initiative have been very impressive and far reaching in the organization on a number of different fronts. Eric Larson : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. A couple questions. The price increases that you took in May, are they all reversed now or is there any residue of that pricing still in the market? Jim Snee : Hey Rob, good morning. It really depends on the category. If you think about what happened in bacon, for example, that pricing does tend to realign itself more frequently, so we\u2019ve seen realignment down and the market now has taken another run back up. It has moved a couple of times since we last talked, but we know that that\u2019s what we have to do to remain competitive. In terms of pepperoni, the pricing that we took there was realigned because the trim market did not at all sustain what we thought it was going to do, and remains low today. On our grocery products front, the Spam pricing that we took, that held, but that really was less related to raw material, more other inflationary measures. So it\u2019s really been a mixed bag across the different categories, but we feel good about the pricing actions we took and the corresponding realignments. Robert Moskow : Got it. Then a follow-up - the grocery division, I haven\u2019t seen the margins dip below 11% in a quarter, I don\u2019t remember the last time. I think you\u2019re kind of hinting around here that, hey a lot of it is transitory related to the crop availability and all that, but why wasn\u2019t the crop availability this big of an issue in second and first quarter for avocadoes? Like why is it suddenly hurting the margin to this degree, and then as we look forward, how quickly can we assume that a normal crop in September will adjust the margins higher? Jim Snee : That\u2019s a great question. The secondary crop impacts our supply situation primarily in Q3, and if you go back to 2017 not on an overall GP margin structure, but if you go back, we had a very similar situation in 2017. At that time, we were very aggressive with our pricing, and this time we re-evaluated and thought we were going to be in a better position to just wait to see what the next crop looks like. So this secondary crop primarily impacts us in Q3 and then in early Q4, we start to get a better read on the primary crop. Early indications are that that\u2019s more favorable, so that will have some impact in Q4 but then we\u2019ll have the primary impact again in Q1 and Q2. Robert Moskow : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. It\u2019s August, so I\u2019m going to ask question number three, here. You talked about Project Orion and the supply chain efforts, and I get that; but I think you also mentioned finance, HR, as well as supply chain as areas where you\u2019ll be evaluating more productivity. Can you be more specific on what that means? Jim Sheehan : Certainly. We will be implementing a single instance of all of our ERP systems across finance, HR, and the supply chain, meaning that all operations will be operated on a common platform. We\u2019ll create great efficiencies in the operations. We\u2019re also focusing on automation and robotics within certain processes, so those are things that Project Orion brings to us. It\u2019s going to make us a more efficient company in many aspects, and obviously the other issue is the quality of information and the decisions that we can make based on that data. Where before we\u2019d have to mine through multiple systems to get information, this will provide a common platform. The information will be readily available and we can do analysis across all aspects of the business. Robert Moskow : Very good, thank you. Operator : Once again ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, it\u2019s star, one on your telephone keypad. Next we\u2019ll go to Thomas Palmer with JP Morgan. Thomas Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Wanted to first kick off talking about the price elasticity that you saw on pork products. Was it as you expected? Do you think it was a little more severe because you were out of line with the industry, and what insights does that give you as you think about potentially layering on new price increases in the coming year? Jim Snee : We saw greater elasticity than we thought, especially in bacon and pepperoni. It really was the fact that the markets did not perform on a continuous basis, so we reached some points of elevation in the belly market and the trim market that really put us into action on the pricing front. What changed was we took pricing, some of the others in the category didn\u2019t, and then the markets didn\u2019t sustain, so when that happened we were priced higher than the category, which created those higher than expected elasticities. That\u2019s where our pricing realignment came in. Once we got our pricing realigned, we felt like the elasticities were in line with what we expected. Bacon is back on track, we think pepperoni is, and then we did talk a little bit about the grocery products pricing that we held with Spam. From Spam\u2019s perspective, volume was relatively flat and sales were up 4%, so if anything, that outperformed the elasticity we expected  So as I said earlier, it really was a mixed bag across all of the different categories where we took pricing. Thomas Palmer : Okay, thanks for that. I just wanted to circle on the avocado side. It sounds like you elected not to take pricing in part because you think that at least a portion of this severe inflation you\u2019re experiencing is temporary. If you do decide early in the fourth quarter as you get the read through, how long does it take to implement pricing? When does that start to materialize in terms of the P&L impact from a COGS standpoint that either the crop is favorable or not? Is this come the first quarter we would see both pricing and COGS basket changing for the new crop, or is the timing different than that? Jim Snee : Got it. You would expect to see impact tail end of the fourth quarter, really into the first quarter either way. From a pricing perspective, if we do choose to take pricing, it\u2019s very consistent with the other retail pricing dynamics that we see and expect it to take approximately 60 days to get into the marketplace. The team will have a pretty good read on it in short order, and we\u2019ll be able to make the right business decision. Thomas Palmer : o Thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Rebecca Scheuneman : Good morning. I have a question about the grocery products margin. Was there any part of the margin decline there that can be attributed to the sale of the CytoSport business, or is that entirely explained by avocadoes and peanut butter pricing? Jim Sheehan : From a margin standpoint, it\u2019s really about the avocado prices and the peanut butter. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay, so nothing at all from CytoSport? Jim Sheehan : No. As we\u2019ve stated, CytoSport would have about a $0.04 impact for the back half of the year from a P&L standpoint, but from margins, it\u2019s really driven by the avocado costs and the peanut butter. Jim Snee : Yes, the existing businesses that we have. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay, thanks. My second question is with this global protein shortage resulting from ASF, is there any reason to believe that this wouldn\u2019t improve the demand for turkey heading into next year? Jim Snee : I think that\u2019s a fair assumption. We need to see how this all plays out through this global trade uncertainty and how the global supply reorganizes, but I do think there is a point of view out there that says poultry products, turkey in particular, could benefit. We\u2019ll see how that materializes the balance of this year and into 2020, but I think that\u2019s a fair assumption. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] I show we have no further questions. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional comments or closing remarks. Jim Snee : Great, thank you. Thanks to all of you for your participation and interest this morning. While our team continues to navigate near term uncertainty, I remain very certain in our teams\u2019 ability to deliver our key results and finish 2019 in a very strong manner. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that during our call, we will refer to these non-GAAP results as organic volume and organic sales. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. We had the opportunity to outline our company's growth strategy at our Investor Day in October. Our 2020 path forward, a set of six strategic priorities sets us up for growth in 2020 and well into the future. The six priorities we presented were, one, growing our Deli and foodservice businesses; two, accelerating growth in ethnic cuisines; three, pursuing bold new innovations; four, expanding our global presence; five, protecting our core brands; and six, continuing to transform our company through one supply chain and Project Orion initiatives. These priorities represent another step forward for Hormel Foods as a global branded food company. We made great progress in 2019. Notably, we launched the Hormel Deli Solutions division and Refrigerated Foods; delivered $700 million in sales from our MegaMex joint venture, which also celebrated its 10th anniversary; completed our state-of-the-art whole bird facility at Jennie-O Turkey Store; exited two non-strategic businesses, CytoSport and hog harvest in Fremont, Nebraska; and made tremendous progress on our one supply chain and Project Orion initiatives. From a financial perspective, we grew organic sales by 1%, improved our cost structure and operating margins. Invested over $290 million back into our business with capital projects such as the Burke pizza topping facility and an additional Fontanini production line, raised our dividend for the 54th consecutive year, the 11th consecutive year of double-digit increases. Repurchased $174 million in common stock, the highest annual repurchase in our history. Reduced our long-term debt and grew our cash balance. From a segment perspective, Refrigerated Foods grew earnings in spite of a 50% decline in commodity profits as our value-added businesses delivered strong growth. The Black Label, Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Natural Choice and Applegate brands were all meaningful contributors to value-added growth. Grocery Products had a year of mixed results. We grew organic volume and sales for the year, driven by brands such as Herdez, Wholly and Dinty Moore. I'm also really proud to say, SPAM had its fifth consecutive year of record sales, which is a tremendous accomplishment. However, sales and profits declined for SKIPPY as we face deflationary pricing pressure due to competitive dynamics in the peanut butter category. Our team rally did an excellent job using revenue growth management with a number of customers to identify the right pricing and promotional tactics to drive category growth for our customers. MegaMex continues to generate excellent top-line growth. From a bottom line perspective, earnings declined as they lap a tax benefit and were impacted by higher avocado markets during the year. Jennie-O Turkey Store managed through both industry oversupply and the effects of two lean Ground Turkey recalls. The fourth quarter proved that the Jennie-O brand remains strong and the additional investment we are making in the business is the right long-term decision. This team clearly has momentum going into 2020. The full year results for the International segment were disappointing. As the team encountered numerous challenges, stemming from African swine fever in China, the impact from tariffs and global trade uncertainty. These headwinds greatly masked excellent growth in our China business. Looking at the fourth quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $0.47. This put our full year earnings at the top end of the guidance range we provided at our Investor Day in October. Sales decreased 1% on a 2% decrease in volume. Organic sales increased 2% on a 1% increase in volume. Three of our four segments, Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Jennie-O, delivered organic volume and sales growth. Total company sales growth was led by brands such as Columbus, Fire Braised, Bacon 1, Natural Choice, Gatherings, SPAM, Herdez, Wholly, and Hormel Chili. Refrigerated Foods grew volume 1% and sales 4%. While many products across retail, deli and foodservice contributed to the sales growth, I would be remiss if I didn't call out the growth we are seeing from Bacon 1. The Hormel foodservice team is doing an excellent job growing Bacon 1 account-by-account. We also recently introduced the product into the club channel under the brand Hormel Thick Cut Reserve. The recent expansion at our facility in Wichita, Kansas is providing the necessary runway to continue growing this important business. Strong earnings growth from our value-added businesses was not able to overcome a 46% decline in commodity profits, leading to a Refrigerated Foods segment profit decline of 3%. Grocery Products volume declined 9% and sales declined 10% due to the divestiture of CytoSport. Organic volume increased 2% and organic sales increased 1%. Center-store brands such as SPAM and Herdez drove sales and earnings growth. Lower pricing on Skippy Peanut Butter remained a headwind this quarter. Jennie-O Turkey Store volume increased 5% and sales increased 3%, primarily due to whole bird and commodity sales increases. Segment profit increased 6% due to operational improvements across their supply chain. As expected, we are regaining distribution on our most important item, lean ground Turkey. We recently gained distribution back at a large customer, but still have work to do in order to get back to our pre-recall distribution levels. Advertising and promotional activities in select key markets also helped drive growth during the quarter. It's important to note, this quarter represents the first time since the fourth quarter of 2016 that we grew volume, sales and segment profit at Jennie-O Turkey Store. International volume sales and segment profit declined dramatically during the quarter. We saw weakness in our export sales and in our Brazil business due to higher protein prices. We are taking the necessary pricing actions to offset these cost increases. From a total company perspective, we expect to deliver sales growth in excess of our 2% to 3% organic sales growth goal in fiscal 2020. Two key drivers to sales growth across the company are innovation and e-commerce. First, we continue to see innovation successes across our business and remain confident as we close in on the final year of our 15% by 2020 challenge. The percentage of sales from products innovated in the last five years has grown at just under 15%. Products such as Natural Choice Snacks Stacks and Wraps, Herdez Guacamole Salsa, the Applegate Blend Burger and SKIPPY P.B. & Jelly Minis are all important initiatives help us achieve our 15% goal. Second, our e-commerce capabilities continue to improve, especially for the online grocery pickup segments. Through our efforts in analytics, package optimization and customer expansion; we see another year of strong double-digit growth for e-commerce. We expect to deliver another year of operating income growth in 2020. The biggest risk factor continues to be the impact African swine fever could have on our business. While we have seen volatility in the market, we have not seen a major and sustained increase in pork costs as we and much of the industry expected. A combination of higher domestic pork production, higher levels of cold storage in China and presumably lower Chinese consumer demand are factors keeping prices in check. Jim Sheehan will provide more details related to our market outlook. We are still very confident in our ability to manage through ASF. First, we are very optimistic about the demand for our products whether from an up and coming regional pizza chain using our Hormel pizza toppings, a Deli consumer looking from our premium charcuterie items like Columbus craft meats or a family looking for affordable and versatile protein like our SPAM family of products. Second, we hold leadership positions in many of the categories in which we compete. This affords us the ability to be pricing leaders when market conditions weren\u2019t. We demonstrated our ability to pass higher pricing during PEDV in 2014 and again during the market run-up in 2017. As a global branded food company and a leader in the industry, we believe it is our responsibility to lead in these situations. Finally, we expect input cost volatility to persist into fiscal 2020. As a net buyer of protein, major market swings can shift profits from quarter-to-quarter when our pricing lags the market. Looking at the segments for 2020, we expect three of our four business units to show sales and profit growth, with the exception being Grocery Products as they lap, the CytoSport divestiture for the first half of the year. We do however expect sales and segment profit growth for the rest of the Grocery Products segment, led by center store brands such as SPAM, Dinty Moore and SKIPPY. We also expect growth from MegaMex and remain extremely confident in our ability to continue growing the Herdez and Wholly brand. I am excited by the authentic and innovative products they are bringing to the marketplace such as Herdez, Refrigerated Guacamole, Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Wholly Smashed Avocados. We expect 2020 will represent a return to growth for Jennie-O Turkey Store. A clear focus on regaining lost lean ground Turkey distribution, the efforts to realign our cost structure and slowly improving industry fundamentals gives us confidence we will get this business back in growth mode. International is expected to show sales and segment profit growth in 2020. However, we do expect volatility as we manage higher input costs in China and Brazil in addition to short-term noise related to an uncertain global trade picture. Again this year, we expect Refrigerated Foods will grow sales and profits led by many brands across foodservice, retail and deli. I have a high level of confidence in this team's ability to execute in the marketplace and continue to grow branded value-added projects. At Investor Day, we highlighted the great work happening within our supply chain group. And I am pleased to report; we achieved our $75 million cost savings goal this year. We also highlighted our long-standing key results of holding controllable cost increases to less than 1% over the prior year. While large investments can impact a single year, we have specific targeted actions to improve our cost structure over time. Achieving our 1% key result implies savings in 2020 of approximately $75 million similar to 2019. Taking all these factors into account, we are setting our full year earnings guidance at $1.69 to $1.83 per share and our sales guidance at $9.5 billion to $10.3 billion. Our expected fiscal 2020 organic pre-tax earnings growth rate is in line with our near-term goal of 5% to 7% organic pre-tax earnings growth we outlined at our Investor Day. As a reminder, CytoSport earnings in 2019 contributed $0.10 to earnings per share. We also expect a higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2020. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for fiscal 2020. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $2.5 billion, down 1%. Organic net sales were up 2% with three to four segments showing growth. Sales for 2019 were $9.5 billion, down 1%. Organic sales were up 1%. Pre-tax earnings were $324 million, up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For 2019, the company grew pre-tax earnings to $1.2 billion, a 2% increase. The full year effective tax rate was 19.1% compared to 14.3% last year. The 2018 tax rate was impacted by deferred tax remeasurements. The effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be between 20.5% and 22.5%. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.47 a share compared to $0.48 last year. Earnings per share for 2019 was $1.80, a 3% decline. The higher effective tax rate contributed to the lower earnings for the quarter and the year. For 2019, SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.3% of sales compared to 7.2% last year. The decline was due to the impact of the CytoSport sale and lower selling and employee-related expenses. In 2020, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase. Excluding CytoSport, expenses will increase because of the costs related to Project Orion. Net unallocated expense was down significantly in 2019, resulting from the gain on the sale of CytoSport, lower selling expenses and a legal settlement in the first quarter. Advertising was $131 million, down from $152 million in 2018. The decline was due to the CytoSport sale. In 2020, we plan to increase advertising expense to support our leading brands, including Natural Choice, Black Label, Wholly, Herdez, SPAM, SKIPPY and Jennie-O. For the full year, operating margins were 12.6% compared to 12.4% in 2018. Lower SG&A was a benefit to margins in 2019. In 2020, we anticipate operating margins to be flat, but we may experience periods of volatility due to input costs. We generated cash from operations of $923 million during the year, down 26%. The decline resulted from higher working capital as we strategically built inventory in anticipation of higher input costs due to African swine fever. The primary uses of cash in 2019 were dividends, debt reduction, CapEx and share repurchases. We paid our 365th consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.84 per share. We also announced an 11% dividend increase for 2020, making the new annual rate $0.93 per share. This marks the 54th consecutive year we have increased the dividend and the 11th consecutive year of double-digit increases. In 2019, we repaid the remaining $375 million in debt associated with the Columbus acquisition. Capital expenditures for 2019 were $294 million, including the expansion of the Burke facility Project Orion and additional capacity for Fontanini products. We targeted capital expenditures of $360 million in 2020, with a focus on value-added capacity projects and automation. Share repurchases for 2019 totaled a record $174 million, almost double any single prior year. 4.3 million shares were repurchased. We will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital allocations utilizing our strong balance sheet to grow through acquisitions and capital investments. We will remain focused on long-term investments to drive exceptional shareholder return. The generally higher input costs for the fourth quarter were in line with expectations. The 2020 guidance range assumes higher protein prices for key inputs. African swine fever continues to impact the global hog supply as the disease spreads in China, Southeast Asia and parts of Europe. The USDA is projecting exports to grow 7% to 8% in 2020. To meet the growing need for exports, total domestic production is expected to increase 2% to 3% according to the USDA. Our prices are expected to increase in excess of 15% in 2020. We anticipate the USDA composite value increases to be consistent with increases in hog prices. Selling prices in 2020 are projected to be marginally higher with periods of volatility. We expect pork and beef trim markets to be higher in 2020. The Turkey industry is beginning to show signs of recovery. Industry data shows turkey placements down 3% since the beginning of 2019. Additionally, cold storage of whole birds continued to decline leading to improved pricing. Pricing for the fourth quarter was up modestly over 2018. We should see the majority of the pricing benefit realized for the 2020 holiday season. Cold storage of breast meat is 5% below last year. Breast meat pricing has traded near $2 over the past 12 months. We expect the market to improve in the second half of 2020. Other Turkey commodity items, such as fire meat should benefit from better pricing in 2020 due to supply shortages on other competing proteins. Freight costs which were up modestly compared to 2018 are projected to be marginally higher next year. Project Orion continues to progress on schedule. In the first quarter of 2020, we will begin the implementation across HR, Finance and supply chain organization. We are excited to begin the transformation of our company to increase efficiency and our analytical capabilities to manage our business. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Eric Larson with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Yes, good morning, everyone. A Happy Thanksgiving to all. Jim Snee : Thanks, Eric. Good morning. Eric Larson : A quick question. We saw -- as Jim outlined, we saw a fairly significant inventory build at the end of the year. So how much cost visibility does that give you folks? Is it -- does it cover the first half or a good portion of 2020? Or how should we look at your ability to control your costs for the near-term with that inventory? Jim Sheehan : Happy Thanksgiving, Eric. This is Jim Sheehan. Eric Larson : Thanks, Jim. Jim Sheehan : We did build inventory at the end of the year and that will give us visibility on some important primals into the first quarter. So I would say well into the first quarter. Eric Larson : Okay. Thanks. And then just real quickly as a follow-up question on your marketing spend here. It was down sharply for the year was mainly divestiture of CytoSport. But you also bumped up your spending in Jennie-O with your burger campaign, which has been very successful. So if you were to look at your marketing spend for the year on an apples-to-apples basis excluding CytoSport would it have been flat to up, down slightly? I mean, how should we look at that marketing spend number? Jim Snee : Eric, I would say that for the year it was relatively flat. One of the things that we've done really well over time is we've been able to consolidate some of our advertising dollars against key brands where we used to have dollars spread a little more widely. But when you think about the work that we've done with SPAM, with SKIPPY, with Natural Choice, with Hormel Pepperoni and now really getting back in the game with our Jennie-O Turkey Store advertising efforts in select key markets, our focus has changed a little bit. And so -- but we've been pleased with the results and the dollars would say relatively flat for the full year. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Good morning, guys. Jim Snee : Hi, Ken. Jim Sheehan : Good morning. Ken Zaslow : Just two questions. One is you talked about two projects that you are underway. The plans in the state-of-the-art, the sausage production, as well as pizza toppings, how much capital you put into that? What's the return on that? And my second question would be on the turkey side. It seems like you've gotten more positive on the underlying fundamentals. Is that because of the trade opening? Or can you discuss more on that? And I'll leave it there. Jim Snee : Okay. I'll start with the second one first, Ken. In terms of the turkey business, we are very positive as we head into 2020. And it's really -- the story is being able to do what we set out to do when we talked to you last quarter. We talked about the need to regain distribution. And we've been able to gain some of that distribution back in the fourth quarter. We have more work to do for the full year, but we do expect to see a sequential improvement as we progress throughout the year. And, of course, not only just gaining back that distribution, but being able to support that business with appropriate advertising dollars that really we had backed off for the last several years as we're facing some of those headwinds. In regards to the two expansion projects that we talked about we're going to -- between the two of them will be roughly $300 million combined. As a reminder, we have already spent some of the money in the Burke project when we announced that and we are quite a ways along. Again, the key message to remember here with both of these projects is that they're supporting our value-added growth. The new plant in Nebraska is designed to support our Columbus business, which has performed incredibly well, and the same thing with our Burke business. Not only does it support the Burke organization, but it supports the pizza topping business in our core foodservice organization. So we're excited to not only announce those projects, but have them come online to really support the business. Ken Zaslow : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Thomas Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jim Snee : Good morning. Thomas Palmer : First, I just wanted to clarify guidance. Your EPS guidance range is $0.14. Your pre-tax income range, I think, it can explain about $0.04 of the variance. Your tax rate guidance can explain around $0.05. So I'm getting kind of a $0.05 gap, could you maybe help reconcile that $0.05 gap? And then, also, just give us some clarity on what exactly the base number is for 2019 that we should be applying that growth from? Jim Snee : Yes. Thomas I think the best way to think about it, in 2019, our results included about $0.10 EPS for CytoSport, which is in our Grocery Products segment profit. And then when you consider that along with a higher tax rate of about $0.03, I mean, that's really where you'll find how our growth is in line with that 5% to 7% organic growth target. So thinking about 2019 actual 1.80, Cyto at 10, tax at 3, gets you to 1.67 number, really as probably a base. And I would say, if there's additional information you need, feel free to follow-up with Nathan. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll probably will follow-up a little bit. And then, just on the international segment, it sounded like there were two main issues. It was the export side and then rising input costs. On the export front, did you shift some of your pork sales, because exports were weak into the Refrigerated segment? And then on the input cost front, you made reference to price increases that you were instituting, sounds like now-ish. What are you assuming in terms of kind of the bounce back in that segment? Are you assuming that exports continue to lag, but you get the pricing flow through? And then is there an offset, as we think about Refrigerated, just given the reallocation. Just trying to understand how that plays out? Jim Snee : Sure. Let me try to help you. When we talk about our export business in international, there's really two components. We've got a strong branded export business. And you would think more around SPAM and SKIPPY, and then our pork export business. So there are two parts. And as we think about 2020, our branded export business is expected to be strong. And although, we talked about it being a little bit soft in the fourth quarter, that really was more of a timing issue. When you think about the fresh pork piece that's really driven about - driven by everything that's happened in the marketplace. As you think about some of the global reorganization of how pork has slowed, especially throughout the Asia region. And that's going to continue to be a headwind until all of the tariffs and global trade uncertainty gets resolved. So that's the first piece, the export piece. The second piece in terms of cost increases in Brazil, we saw kind of a constant run up throughout the year. The biggest impact really in the fourth quarter. And so we did get a little more aggressive with our pricing in the fourth quarter and then we expect some of those cost increases to moderate next year. But that's really what's driving those comments around exports and input costs in Brazil. Jim Sheehan : Thomas back to your first question. When you think about that $0.10 in CytoSport, you should think about it $0.04 came out of Grocery Products, $0.03 was a reduction on net unallocated through the gain. And then there was a $0.03 tax gain. So that's how you can think about the $0.10. Operator : We will now take our next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning. Ben Bienvenu : I wanted to ask about Jennie-O, really impressive sequential improvement in the results there. And in particular, noteworthy, I thought that you mentioned, you'd won back distribution with a large customer. I'm curious to hear what is the factor or factors that are driving that conversion to get distribution back with your larger customers. Do you have to allocate additional trade spend or professional dollars or is it just demonstration of more consistent results and improved execution? Jim Snee : Yes. So I mean, we are very pleased with what the team was able to get done in the fourth quarter. And it's consistent with the commentary that we've provided that when we did lose distribution, the category tended not to perform for the retailer. And that where we did have distribution the category was performing as expected. And so being able to take that story and remind the retailers of what we're able to do with the leading brand has been very powerful. And then of course, we are supporting it. We've talked about some of the advertising in select key markets. We are supporting it with trade dollars, especially at the outset. But the big win here is the distribution gain as we head off into 2020. Also would remind you that we have more work to do. So we have regained distribution but we have more work to do early in the year and really throughout the year. And then just as a reminder for the JOTS business, we are going to still lap some pre-recall sales in Q1. So when you take the total year, we are very, very optimistic about the JOTS business, starting with what we've been able to get done in the fourth quarter. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. And then a follow-up question on guidance. Just thinking about the top end versus the bottom end of the range kind of the swing factors that dictate that whether it's the timing or magnitude of African swine fever, given that you've considered some implication associated with price inflation and cost inflation there, maybe some of the other key factors that we should be considering as we monitor sort of the progress of the results for the year. Jim Snee : Sure. I mean, you hit on obviously the key risk factor and we talked about that in the comments in regards to ASF is less of an event from an international perspective. If tariffs are lifted and we see a more \u2013 well, we would consider a more normalized flow of product. And then the other thing that we just talked about is if we're able to gain back distribution at JOTS faster than anticipated. I mean, those are things that really drive us towards the top side. On the bottom side, if the impact of ASF is sustained and steady increases in costs that continue to compress margins as we're catching up with pricing that could be a headwind. But as we talked about that's on the way up. And once costs moderate, we'll be in a much better position. But that's really how we're thinking about bottom side and top side of the range. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Jim Snee : Hi, Michael. Michael Lavery : I was off for a minute. I just hope somebody didn't just ask this, but when you mentioned the protein increases that you expect -- that you factor into guidance, how does that compare to now? And what magnitude do you have already is your expectation in a base case scenario? Jim Snee : Certainly. So let's start with hogs. Hogs went up about 11% in the fourth quarter of 2019 and we anticipate that they'll go up 15% over 2020. With higher prices in the back half compared to the first half. The cutout value was up 4% in the fourth quarter. We think it will go up probably just under that 15% and with a similar run rate with higher prices in the second half compared to the first half, bellies were up 15% in the first quarter and we think that they're going to go up low single digits. And we see belly is fairly consistent across the time frame. Now bellies are up 132 now, so they're a little bit lower right now but we've seen a lot of volatility in the belly markets. So we've seen some significant moves even day-to-day in the belly market. And then 72% trim, which of course is an important input, was up 9% in the fourth quarter. We think they'll be up high single digits in 2020 with higher prices probably in the back half. They're at $76 as we look at it today, so they've already seen a little bit of a run-up from where they were in the fourth quarter. So you're seeing that volatility in the trim and the bellies and as we always say, volatility will create some noise for us between quarters. In the end it will -- we'll be able to recover those costs but volatility will be important to us. We'll watch that. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on some of the language in that first guidance paragraph, you mentioned some of the brands that are key drivers of growth. But then you mentioned a few that you're going to put a lot of energy behind. It reads initially like maybe that's not as bullish but your prepared remarks for Bacon 1 certainly sound quite optimistic. How do we think about Bacon 1 and the outlook there? Do you still expect this to grow? And then also the same question for Fire Braised, which wasn't on either list. Jim Snee : Yeah. Michael, I mean, we are very bullish. I mean, all the brands that we had in the press release, I mean, those are the ones that have grown and really are on trend with today's consumer. And not only are we growing the core business, but we're innovating against those. And when you talk about our foodservice brands, especially Bacon 1 and Fire Braised, the growth opportunities for both of those brands in our foodservice space are still very, very strong. We talked about the Bacon 1 growth and how it happens account by account and that's really a hallmark of how our foodservice business operates. It's the ability to penetrate, saturate and dominate the operator community with these key brands. We also have obviously plenty of capacity for Bacon 1 as we completed the expansion of our Wichita, Kansas facility last year to meet the needs for that business. The other thing that we talked about in the prepared remarks is the fact that we're now moving Bacon 1 into the club channel under our Thick Cut reserve brand, where it's met with a lot of consumer acceptance. So we feel good about both Bacon 1 and Fire Braised, not only in core food service and then we didn't even talk about the opportunities that they represent in the deli business for the prepared foods section. So, very bullish on both of those, along with all the brands that we have listed in our press release. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Heather Jones : Good morning. Jim Snee : Morning. Jim Sheehan : Morning. Heather Jones : Look, I have a quick detailed question on corporate expense. So even taking out the gain on sale and all, it was down considerably from 2018 and 2017. I was just wondering, how we should be thinking about that run rate for 2020? Jim Sheehan : For 2020, I would target it in the $40 million to $60 million range, Heather. It's a small number, so small changes have a big percentage impact. We had the CytoSport gain in 2019. But we've also lowered our selling expenses. We had lower employee-related expenses. Some of the cost-saving programs that we put in place are showing their impact in SG&A. But I would see it in the $40 million to $60 million range. Heather Jones : Okay. Thank you for that. And then my second question is on Jennie-O, a two-part question. So from what I remember, you guys are a net buyer of breast meat. So is this business -- should I be thinking about this in the sense of, if exports for that business pick up at all, that would be -- well, I guess, more simplistically, would you rather the dark meat part of the bird to go higher over, et cetera, or would you rather breast meat go higher? Jim Sheehan : Yeah. I mean, really, Heather, that changes every year. And, of course, our supply chain people are able to navigate and take advantage of the opportunities. Obviously, there was an announcement in regards to China here recently. We just learned that we have seven of our plants that are approved. We're still working through the details. But at a very high level, we expect that announcement and the opening of the market to be positive for us. Operator : We will now take our next question from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hey, thanks and Happy Thanksgiving. Jim and Jim, your forecast for a 15% increase in the cutout value that's for the full year. But then you said that the second half expected to be I guess the inflation to be higher than the first half. So I mean, does that kind of indicate like a pretty sharp run-up in the second half? And are you thinking first half is like single-digit and then it spikes quite a bit higher because of -- I don't know frozen inventories running out in China. And if that's how you think about it, how have you prepared your customers for that type of an increase? And then I have a follow-up. Jim Snee : That is not how we think about it. We're thinking about it just being a few percentage difference between the first and the second half. So we don't see a significant run-up in the market. Jim Sheehan : From a pricing perspective Rob, I mean, if there is a -- if there is a dramatic run-up in pricing, what we've talked about it in regards to what's happened or what happened with PEDV. And really there you had the run-up -- belly prices for example went up, I think it was at $1.30 to $1 -- $1.30 to $2.50 in three months. And we were able to take pricing, the market warranted it and customers understood that. And if you go back to what happened on shelf, bacon that was usually $3.99 to $4.99 went to $9.99. And so there's a precedent here. And I think depending on how the markets weren't that pricing the customer -- we've had the conversations with the customers. Really we've been talking about ASF for over a year now and it's not going to be a surprise to anyone. Robert Moskow : Okay. Can you give us a little more detail into fourth quarter itself. One of your competitors said that there was a lot of inflation in bellies and then it kind of all reversed very quickly and that movement made it hard to change pricing quickly enough to react. Did you see something similar for yourselves? Or were you able to adjust accordingly? Or maybe the timing was different? Jim Snee : Bellies averaged about 157 in the fourth quarter and right now bellies are at 132. So you've seen some movement but you've seen volatility in bellies for the last two years. So I wouldn't say that amount of volatility we've seen in bellies in the fourth quarter and early into our first quarter is anything unusual. Jim Sheehan : Yes. And from a pricing perspective, nothing really to speak of on the retail front. Some adjustments on foodservice but we always talk about how we're able to stay a little bit closer to the markets with our foodservice business but nothing that was overly impactful. Operator : We will now take our next question from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to follow-up on the happy little plants launch that you guys discussed at the Analyst Day. I was curious what type of retailer and foodservice interest you're seeing so far? And how you guys are thinking about the contribution from this launch this year? Jim Snee : Yes, the contribution Rupesh is going to be minimal in 2020. Really for us, it's the learning about that space. Another is the reception at the retailer and consumer level has been positive. We're probably seeing a little more acceptance in the foodservice space. And so the foodservice team has done a nice job with that same retail pack introducing it into foodservice operators. In addition, just some of the blend burger items that we talked about at Investor Day. So it's really the combination of I'll say the pure play and then also the blended play that we're very intrigued by our agile team is already working on 2.0 to build out that line, thinking about different forms that we should be taking to the marketplace. So -- and based on the early read, it's positive, we're still heading down that path to build out the line, but I wouldn't look for any meaningful contribution in 2020. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up question. So for the full year guidance, does that at all contemplate share buybacks than the EPS targets? Jim Sheehan : It does take into account some share repurchase. And we face share repurchase on our intrinsic value of the stock and the amount of stock options that are being exercised offset for dilution. So we do have a number in there. So yes. Operator : We will now take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So a follow-up, Jim Sheehan on the guidance on port costs. And if I heard you comments correctly before, you talked about a 50% increase in hog prices, a 15% or so increase in the cutout values, but then lower increases in bellies and trim as components of that cutout. So should we take that to imply that you think that there's more inflation likely in other cuts of hams, shoulders and butts that would actually present opportunities on the commodity profit side and the contribution that that would present? I'm just trying to understand the piece of that. Because the cuts that you typically would be long seem to be the ones do you think there's more inflation in? Jim Sheehan : Yeah, Adam. I think a good example is hams right now. Hams averaged $69 in the fourth quarter and they're up to $94 early in -- or late last week. So you're seeing some inflation in hams that I would say normally you wouldn't see. So I would say there's opportunities in some of the other commodities. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then taking a step back at a high level with the guidance, I think you talked about increases year-on-year in advertising and SG&A, I believe as a percent of sales. Do you have what the clean gross profit would be in -- gross profit margins would have been in 2019 if we strip -- fully strip CytoSport out? I'm just trying to get a sense of what kind of gross profit expansion is embedded in the guidance at least, can you talk about operating margins up. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand that in the context of higher SG&A? Jim Sheehan : Well, we're talking about advertising costs, we're talking about the increase that we're seeing in advertising costs for instance we're expecting in the high single digits and that's off the base without CytoSport. You're going to see higher SG&A, because we're going to have some Orion implementation cost in SG&A. So I'd say that those would be unusual from a run rate. So we're talking about some unusually high expenses in SG&A because of the implementation of Project Orion that will start actually in the next couple of weeks. We'll start some implementation with that. Jim Sheehan : And, Adam, I would say, I mean, some of the more detailed items, certainly you follow-up with Nathan or corporate. And that we -- for us, the message here is really the pre-tax operating profit growth that's in line with that 5% to 7% or organic target that we laid out at Investor Day. Operator : We will now take our next question from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rebecca Scheuneman : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. We've talked a lot about ASF and the impact you expect that to have on your pork export business, I mean, your JOTS business. But I'm kind of wondering, how you expect that to impact your SPAM business, given the increasing popularity that we're seeing of SPAM in China? And I assume that there's probably some positive demand opportunities, probably some cost risk. But I'd just like to hear the way you're thinking about ASF impact on that brand and kind of what you're expecting for 2020. Jim Snee : Yes. It's a really, really good question. And when -- at a high level with ASF, we fully understand the scenario that results in higher prices. And I think we've talked a lot about our ability to price in the event that we see a larger scale or bigger impact ASF have had, whether that's domestically or in our business in China. The SPAM brand is a brand that has probably some of our strongest pricing power. To be honest with you, it's in a category by itself, so to speak. And if you remember, we did take SPAM pricing this year based on some of the runoff that we saw, not only in the market, but some of the buildup that we'd have in expenses over the last couple of years. And we do have a scenario modeled where if we have to take pricing again. We're positioned to do that. But we are closely watching the fundamentals of supply and demand. And if we need to take pricing with SPAM, we'll do that. To your point, what's happening in China with SPAM is incredibly positive. It's exceeded all of our expectations and we've been able to really build out that distribution even faster than we expected. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. And then, as a follow-up, like, so are you -- I know you're experiencing very strong growth in the brand in China. But have you seen an acceleration today? Or maybe that's delayed due to the high cold storage? Jim Snee : In regard -- are you talking about SPAM? Rebecca Scheuneman : Yes. Yes. Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, the growth has been steady, but it has exceeded the expectations, when we model putting in the SPAM line in our plant in Jiaxing, China. We've been able to exceed the distribution growth expectations that we had, even in spite of some of the higher costs. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Operator : We will now take our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jim Snee : Yes. Hi, Peter. Peter Galbo : Jim, just wanted to ask on the sales guidance. I would assume that kind of the high end of the range is assuming some pricing goes through to offset some of the inflation that you're expecting. I guess, what would be helpful though is what kind of demand elasticity are you assuming in relation to any price increases on things like bacon or pepperoni? Jim Snee : Yes, Peter you're right. I mean, we do have the high end of the pricing would be driven by the scenario that results in higher cost coming from ASF. And the elasticity is really vary across business unit and vary across brand. What we saw, and again I'll go back and reference what we saw during the PEDV event, where you saw belly prices go from $1.30 to $2.50, retails go from $3.99, $4.99 to $9.99 and we still saw very strong volumes in that bacon category. And so it does vary from category to category, business to business, but we obviously are very incredibly sensitive to that working closely with the retailers and having the brand strength, the brand power that we referenced in our comments and then also having that direct-selling organization in our foodservice business is the opportunity to get in front of the customers and tell the story of the products as a solution versus just the cost. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one quick clean up one. On Jennie-O, I mean with Thanksgiving being as late as possible as it could be this year, is there an extra kind of week of shipments that you've got maybe that's spilled over into 1Q that we should be thinking about on the volume side? Jim Snee : No. I mean we haven't really thought about it that way. Just again, as a reminder, we're still lapping some of the pre-recall sales from Q1 of last year as we head into 2020. Really the key takeaway for JOTS is this distribution wins for lean ground Turkey. We're obviously working on the next few wins and we've got to bring those across the finish line. Still early but we're really seeing the right signs for this business. And that's why we feel like they have so much momentum going into 2020. Operator : We will now take our last question from Benjamin Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Hey, good morning, Jim and Jim Just a quick follow-up on the CapEx. So kind of realized last quarter you were guiding for like $250 million for full year. As you said there were a couple of delays in some of the things and then actually you ended up spending $294 million. Could you elaborate a little bit on that significant increase of what was spent already in the third quarter? Is it all related to the new plan for Columbus? And then if you could lay down a little bit in between what is the Burke pizza toppings, the facility in Nebraska and Project Orion. Can you just split what the CapEx is going to look like, what each segment is going to get from the $360 million in 2020? Jim Sheehan : Thanks, Benjamin. You are correct. The increase of what we expected in 2019 had to do with the early stages of the acquisition of the property for the Columbus expansion. Originally we thought that was going to fall into 2020 but we got to close a little bit faster than what we thought. And you are correct in the three big projects that we're looking at in our $360 million is finishing up the Burke project, the Columbus expansion and Project Orion and I'll refer to you to -- I'll refer to you to Nathan to get a little bit more detail on the actual breakout of those numbers. Benjamin Theurer : Okay, perfect. And then on the inventory, you've clarified already the increase on purchases to be prepared for ASF. But can you give us a little bit of an idea of how much actually the decrease was because of the divestiture of CytoSport? So, how would have been inventory a year ago, if we would have to exclude CytoSport just to get a clean like-for-like comparison to understand the actual magnitude of the increase? Jim Snee : Certainly. CytoSport inventory ran $25 million in that range. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. I'd now like to turn it back to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Jim Snee : So on behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, thank you to all of you for joining us today. To our team members listening in, thank you for all your tireless work that allows our company to be so successful in the marketplace. Your focus on delivering our key results and maintaining our culture of accountability is truly uncommon. Happy Thanksgiving. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

Good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last October, we outlined our 2020 path forward, which included growing our deli and foodservice brands as a top priority. This morning's announcement of an agreement to acquire Sadler's Smokehouse is another step forward on this initiative. Sadler's Smokehouse, based in Henderson, Texas, has been making authentic pit-smoked barbecue products since 1948. Hormel has been fortunate to have the Sadler organization as a key supplier for over two decades. When the Sadler family decided it was time to sell the business, a new Hormel Foods was the company to call. Over the past few months, we have been working on finalizing this deal. And I am personally excited to welcome their brand, products and team members to the Hormel Foods family. Authentic barbecue remains on trend in the U.S. The number of many mentions has increased at a strong pace over the past 10 years. And today, barbecue extends well beyond the traditional barbecue restaurant format. With Sadler's as the key supplier, we have been able to capture this favorable trend through our Austin Blues barbecue brand. Austin Blues is a line of genuine slow-smoked beef, pork and chicken products for the foodservice and deli channels. As one of our premium Preprinter protein brands, Austin Blues has seen great success in growth. We are doing the difficult work of preparing the product so the operator doesn't have to. However, they still get the flexibility to customize the product with their own signature sauce. We see similarities between this acquisition and the acquisitions of the Burke Corporation in 2008 and Fontanini Italian Meats and Sausages in 2017. Both Burke and Fontanini have been very successful contributors to our foodservice growth, and each has required capacity expansions to keep up with the growing demand. Sadler's will strengthen our position in foodservice, and we see a tremendous opportunity to further extend their authentic barbecue products into both the retail and deli channels with our dedicated sales forces, innovation capabilities and track record of brand stewardship. We expect to close the acquisition in March, and Jim Sheehan will provide more details relating to the financials in his prepared remarks. Now let's turn to our first quarter results, which were in line with our expectations as we delivered earnings per share of $0.45. volume decreased 1%, while organic volume increased 2%. Sales increased 1% and organic sales increased 4%. Three of our four segments, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and International delivered volume and sales growth. It is encouraging to see Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a second consecutive quarter of volume, sales and earnings growth. We have made capital and marketing investments into many brands, which are driving these results. These brands include, but are not limited to, SPAM, Hormel BLACK LABEL, Fontanini, Columbus, Hormel BACON 1 and Hormel Fire Braised. Looking at the segments, Refrigerated Foods grew volume 3% and sales 6%. We generated strong demand across many of our value-added businesses, including retail and foodservice. In addition to some of the brands I just listed, Hormel Cure 81 and Hormel GATHERINGS also showed nice growth. A notable contributor this quarter was Applegate, which is doing really well in both the retail and foodservice channels with their line of natural and organic products. Their snacking platform is growing with products like the Applegate charcuterie plate made with their natural meats and cheeses. We also feel really good about Applegate's meat and plant-blend products and have seen success in the foodservice channel. We will continue to innovate in this space with new and exciting offerings for consumers. Refrigerated Foods grew earnings 3% led by growth in our foodservice business and higher commodity profits. Refrigerated Foods benefited from lower belly prices during the quarter, but that benefit was offset by significantly higher pork and beef trim prices. While volatility and input costs negatively impacted our retail and deli divisions due to the longer lead times for pricing, our foodservice team reacted swiftly to the changing market conditions. Our balanced pork supply chain is intentionally designed to take volatility out of our total pork costs during extreme market conditions, and that played out this quarter as expected. While hog market prices were lower during the quarter, the balanced mix of hog contracts and our long-term supply contract at Fremont limited some of the upside profit potential that we may have captured five or 10 years ago. With our new structure to reduce volatility, we didn't capture the entire upside but we also expect to minimize the downside when opposite market conditions occur. This supply chain is the right structure for our business. And Jim Sheehan will expand upon my comments. Looking forward, the fundamentals in Refrigerated Foods continue to be very strong. The large categories we compete in, such as pizza toppings and bacon, continue to grow as consumer and operator demand remains favorable. Pizza and bacon are not only ubiquitous in both at-home and away-from-home eating occasions, they are also showing excellent growth. Differentiated brands like Fire Braised, BACON 1, Fontanini, Columbus and BLACK LABEL are all outpacing industry growth, and we continue to make long-term investments into those product lines.  Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a second consecutive quarter of volume, sales and profit growth. Higher volumes and pricing for the commodity and whole bird businesses drove the improved results. Operational improvements across their supply chain also contributed to growth. It is encouraging to see the efforts to realign our cost structure start to pay off, as we described at our recent Investor Day, and we do expect this trend to continue throughout the year. The sales and marketing teams have done a good job regaining Jennie-O lean ground turkey distribution. In conjunction with these efforts, we have broadened our advertising campaign for Jennie-O and continue to see positive results from those investments. We are taking the necessary steps to fully restore our position in the lean ground turkey category. And with two consecutive quarters of growth at Jennie-o Turkey Store, we now have strong momentum across the business. Grocery products volume declined 14% and sales declined 11%, primarily due to the divestiture of CytoSport. Organic volume decreased 4%, and organic sales decreased 1%. We continue to see growth in the SPAM family of products, Wholly Guacamole and their best salsas and sauces and also expect this trend to continue. We saw lower organic volume during the quarter and attribute some of the decline to the timing of the SNAP disbursement last year. While hard to quantify the exact impact, higher shipments during late January in 2019 did not repeat with the same magnitude this year. Earnings for grocery products declined 28% due to the divestiture of CytoSport, higher raw material costs, a decline in contract manufacturing profits and lower volumes. SKIPPY Peanut Butter continue to experience headwinds this quarter as the category was negatively impacted by a competitor's deflationary pricing actions last year. We will lap the pricing declines after the second quarter, and we remain focused on building the Skippy brand through effective promotional strategies, advertising and continued innovation. Another dynamic in grocery products is our strategy shift on Hormel Chili. Historically, Chili was heavily promoted during the football season. Using revenue growth management, we learned that many of promotions during this time frame drove volume but did not provide acceptable returns for us or our retail partners. This year, we made the strategic shift to reallocate some promotional expenses to advertising investments. This shift impacted results in the but we believe it will ultimately lead to a stronger and more profitable Hormel Chili brand for us and our retail partners. International volume and sales increased for the quarter, primarily due to fresh pork exports and strong growth in China. However, segment profit declined by 20% as significantly higher pork prices negatively impacted our businesses in China and Brazil, in addition to our affiliated businesses in South Korea and the Philippines. Our global team continues to take the necessary pricing actions to offset cost increases. Like the rest of the world, we are monitoring the coronavirus outbreak in Asia. First and foremost, we are concerned for the safety of our employees in the region. We are working closely with our management team in China as the situation unfolds. Our team members across all functions of our business in China, from the sales and marketing to plant professionals, observe the extended Lunar New Year holiday and started to return to work as of February 10. However, we still have a majority of our employees who have not returned to work due to self quarantining and transportation restrictions. Similar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal. From a sales perspective, the demand for our foodservice products, which represent the majority of our sales in China, has dropped off considerably as patrons are not eating out. On the other hand, we have seen a large uptick in retail sales of shelf-stable products like SPAM and Skippy as consumers dine at home. We do expect to be a very difficult second quarter for International, primarily due to the impact of the coronavirus. However, if the outbreak is contained soon, the second half of the year could be more favorable as we refill the sales pipeline and get our plants back to running at full speed. Taking all these factors into account, we are maintaining our full year earnings guidance at $1.69 to $1.83 per share and our sales guidance at $9.5 billion to $10.3 billion. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter and key assumptions for fiscal 2020. Jim Sheehan : Thanks, Jim. Good morning. Net sales for the quarter were $2.4 billion, up 1%. Organic net sales were up 4%, with three to four segments showing growth. Pretax earnings were $290 million, down 5%. The decline was driven primarily by the sale of CytoSport. The effective tax rate was 16.3% compared to 21.3% last year. The rate was impacted by the large volume of stock option exercises in the quarter. This is a timing issue and does not impact our expected full year tax rate, which remains between 20.5% and 22.5%. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.45, I said about last year and in line with our expectations. For the quarter, SG&A, excluding advertising, was 6.7% of sales compared to 7.1%, excluding the $0.02 legal settlement benefit in 2019. Net unallocated expense for the quarter decreased by $9.7 million. Last year, we incurred expenses associated with the Fremont sale. We expect net unallocated expense to be between $40 million and $60 million for the year. Advertising investments for the quarter were $35 million, up from $34 excluding CytoSport. Operating margins were 11.8% compared to 13% last year. Lower gross margins for Grocery Products was the primary driver. We generated cash from operations of $1 88 million during the quarter, a 1% increase. We paid our 366th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 18 at an annual rate of $0.93 per share, an 11% increase over 2019. Capital expenditures were $58 million. We expect capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $360 million. Large capital projects include the Burke facility expansion, which will be completed in the summer; a new Columbus dry sausage facility; and Project Orion. Working capital increased as we continue to build inventory in anticipation of the upcoming relocation of the value-added production lines from Fremont to other Hormel facilities and higher input costs due to African swine fever. The company did not repurchase stock in the first quarter. As Jim mentioned, we announced the acquisition of Sadler's early this morning. The purchase price is $270 million with a $40 million cash tax benefit. This makes the effective purchase price $230 million. The deal includes the Sadler's brand and the production facility in Henderson, Texas. The acquisition will be funded with cash on hand and will report into the Refrigerated Foods segment. The transaction is an asset deal, which results in the $40 million cash tax benefit from the asset valuation step up.  Hormel is one of the largest customers of Sadler's as they produce numerous items for our Austin Blues product line. Annual sales, excluding Hormel, are approximately $140 million. Sadler's operating margins are in line with the total company average. We estimate this deal will be neutral to slightly dilutive in 2020 as we plan to make immediate investments into the business and production facility. In total, raw material costs were up from last year with volatility across many commodities, which can shift profitability between quarters. As a reminder, approximately half of our pork raw materials are sourced through the purchase of hogs and half are sourced externally based on primal values. Our cost of products increased over last year, driven by two factors : hogs purchased on the cutout formula were above last year and significantly exceeded the spot market. We also experienced higher cost for hogs purchased on future contracts. Hogs purchased on market-based formulas were down from last year but not enough to offset the cutout formula and future contracted hogs. USDA composite value costs increased 4% over last year. This is the valuation method for raw materials contracted through our former Fremont facility. Our strategic shift to purchase pork raw materials at market prices through a long-term partnership with Fremont was a key driver to the reduction in volatility. However, due to strength in the trim and ham markets, total pork costs through this partnership were higher than last year. Beef and trim markets were up from last year. Bellies were down in the quarter. We have previously discussed pricing action in Refrigerated Foods, retail and deli lagged the market by 30 to 45 days. The outlook for the remainder of 2020 assumes higher protein prices for key inputs with periods of volatility. As we look at the fundamentals in the hog industry, the most recent USDA supply and demand report estimates a 4.5% increase in production and a more than 15% increase in exports. The forecasted additional supply of pork is in line with the increase in export demand. Pork in cold storage was at record levels at the end of the year. African swine fever continues to impact global hog supply in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. Worldwide demand for U.S. pork remains high with the industry setting an all-time record for exports in December. Recently, we have seen downward pressure on domestic hog and pork prices. Since the start of our second quarter, market hogs in the USDA composite value have declined by more than 10%. Bellies and pork trim have been lower price as much as 30%. The outbreak of the coronavirus in China may be a contributing factor. Turkey market conditions continue to improve as industry measures showed pulp placements down 3% in 2019. Overall, turkey inventory in cold storage is down 23%, and compared to last year with breast meat inventory down 19%. Feed costs for the first quarter were flat to last year. We anticipate higher feed costs for the remainder of the year driven by lower levels of protein and the corn crop relative to prior years. This is requiring us to reformulate our feed with higher cost ingredients. We began the implementation of Project Orion in January with the global rollout of the Oracle Human Capital Management System, which updates our payroll, benefits, talent management and workforce management. Additional integrations for finance and the supply chain are taking place throughout 2020. Incremental costs associated with the phased implementation are fully reflected in the guidance for the year. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now we'll take our first question from Benjamin Theurer from Barclays. Thank you. Your line is open. Benjamin Theurer : Hey, good morning, guys. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Good morning Jim and Jim. So one question on the acquisition you've announced. Because clearly, you've laid out how this is going to fit in and what the financials are. Now you've also said you're going to immediately invest in the operation. Is that something we should consider from a CapEx point of view? Is that going to be meaningful with up to the $360 million you've announced prior? And where do you think you have most of the potential, within foodservice or actually taking those products into retail, as you've mentioned in your prepared remarks? And then I have one quick follow-up. Jim Snee : Good morning, Ben. I mean, there's a couple of areas. I mean, as we go through facilities in the acquisition process, we usually find some opportunities to upgrade facilities. That's the case here. Also perhaps some needed maintenance, that's not unusual. And as we look at our overall budget of the $360 million, we're holding that number the same because we have projects that ebb and flow throughout the year. So we don't really see the need to modify that number at this point. In terms of the opportunity, in the short term, this is definitely going to have a bigger impact in our \u2013 in the foodservice space. And I think as we move further down the line, that's when we see the opportunity to really build out a bigger retail presence and expand it into the deli. And of course, it aligns well strategically with all those areas, and over the last several years, we've talked about at various times, different strategies we have in place to expand all of those businesses. It stays on track with our foodservice strategy. From a deli perspective, we've talked a lot about how retailers are looking to expand and improve their prepared food offerings. This will be a great opportunity for us to do that. We already have a presence in the retail space with Lloyd's barbecue, but we think this will be an opportunity for us to really improve the product offerings that we have. So as you go around the different businesses, there's a lot of boxes that it checks in a very positive way. Benjamin Theurer : Perfect. And then just one follow-up on ASF. I mean, clearly, we've been in a situation where prices, for example, in your international operations, be it in Brazil, China have been significantly impacted already. In the U.S., it's more of a volatility thing. What measures have you taken to kind of produce over that volatility? Is there anything you can do in terms of medium long-term contracts to kind of lock in some sort of pricing and then ultimately take the pricing action you need to do on the shelf to offset maybe that higher input costs on a year-over-year basis. Anything you've been doing on that hedging strategy. Jim Sheehan : Surely Ben. Thanks for the question. We have taken hedge positions. And in fact, we talked a little bit about the fact with the unusual market conditions that we experienced in this quarter. As hog prices were down, the spot market was down as the primals turkey value was going up. I mean, that's a very unusual market condition. In fact, it's only happened in three quarters over the last 21 quarters, where that market condition has existed. Some of those future contracts did were negative to the P&L in the first quarter. But we are taking future contracts. We feel that our various approach with multiple formula pricing for our acquisition of hogs is a sound approach to the volatility that exists. Jim Snee : And Ben, I would add, I mean, clearly, there's a level of uncertainty in the marketplace now that you got the impact of the coronavirus in China and the impact that's having on export markets in terms of reports of exports backing up and the idea of what happens to the hog supply here in the short term. SO there's still a lot of uncertainty because of ASF, because of the coronavirus. And as you would expect, we're watching all of the fundamentals very closely. And if we get to the point where we have to take \u2013 have to take pricing, as we demonstrated last year, we're willing to do that. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And now we'll take our next question from Mr. Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tom Palmer : Good morning and thanks for the question. I first wanted to clarify your segment guidance. I think you previously expected organic EBIT, so excluding CytoSport, to be up in all four of your segments. If I interpreted the release correctly, I think you're still looking for Refrigerated and Jennie-O to be up year-over-year. It sounded like International down. And then I wasn't sure on the Grocery side. So I guess, one, is that correct? And then two, what is the grocery outlook for the year? Jim Snee : Yes. Thomas, your assessment is correct. So Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O, up. Uncertainty, obviously, in the International segment, given what's happening in the marketplace. And then we did call out, in our fourth quarter call, the fact that net of CytoSport, GP would be up. And so we are still holding to those numbers in that comment. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. And just to follow-up on the grocery side. You did call out the headwinds from rising trim. And it sounds like that's come in a bit, but would you elect to take any pricing? Are we going to see any flow-through here as we look towards the second quarter of pricing on products that are exposed to trim? Or did it roll over fast enough that it was not needed? Jim Snee : That's exactly right. I mean, the \u2013 although the price in the markets ramp up, they didn't hold long enough for us to take any pricing activity. So we didn't take any in the first quarter. We don't have anything on the radar right now for the second quarter. And the point that you made in terms of it impacting the quarter is exactly right. We saw that in our chili business. And of course, as we changed our strategy, he had kind of a double effect of the rising market and then we made an intentional decision to change the strategy and how we went to market. So no pricing and really nothing on the radar. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And now we'll take our next question from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Peter Galbo : Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Jim, I just want to get your kind of higher level thoughts on the announcement yesterday that you guys had been reading to racked up to be the free pork and just \u2013 should we read into that at all as maybe commodity is going to start making up a greater portion of the business, again, because it just provides more export opportunities? Or just how should we think about that at a high level? Jim Snee : I mean, at high level, this isn't new news to the industry. You've seen some other big players already make that move. We've had it on our radar for some time. Do we think that it makes sense all of a sudden, a huge export, a bigger export player, it won't be huge? But we do think there will be some opportunities. The other thing to consider that our ability to really make this shift is tied to the sale of the Fremont plant, our relationship with WholeStone who has a vertically integrated supply chain. And so we're given that opportunity. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just switching to Jennie-O. Obviously, the distribution gains are positive and volumes are moving in the right direction. But pricing, at least for the industry, is still challenged. And Jim Sheehan, I think you gave some statistics around cold storage and cold placements, but breast meats in turkey in particularly remain pretty weak. Just any thoughts there? And what's it really going to take to get back to kind of accelerate? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, I think it's really \u2013 it's more of a seasonal issue, seasonally lower. I think the market conditions are the fundamentals that we're describing are positive to the business. And so it's nice to have the market fundamentals positive. In addition to the positive work being done in the business, really, the things that we can control as we talk about delivering excellent results across the supply chain, live production, manufacturing, the improvements in lean ground turkey sales and continuing to gain back that distribution. So in my prepared remarks, Peter, I really talked about the momentum that we're seeing in the business. And for us, that's really the key takeaway is that it has trended down, and it's been a difficult business. Peter Galbo : Great, thank very much. Jim Snee : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And now we take our next question from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead, your line in now open. Heather Jones : Thank you for the questions. Good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning. Heather Jones : I wonder if you could talk about China a little bit. So you mentioned that the majority of your sale \u2013 of your employees are still not back at work due to quarantines and transportation issues. But I was wondering if you could give us a closer look at like what have you seen over the last week or so, has there been any improvement in that cadence of sales? Or does it seem like the country is still largely as it was a week or so ago. Jim Snee : Yes. All of our reports, Heather, are that is as it was a week ago and probably even slightly before that. What we were describing is \u2013 the largest portion of our sales in China are foodservice sales. And you've seen multiple reports, and we're no different, that the foodservice industry has essentially come to a halt in China. And so not only are we having the demand side in foodservice. Where there are opportunities, we're seeing some retail shelf-stable items. We talked about SPAM and SKIPPY Peanut Butter, the supply side and getting the plant to produce those products get that up and running, has been an issue as well. So we \u2013 you've got it on both sides of the supply and demand equation. Again, as we said, we understand where we are today. The problem is really forecasting when do we see it start to change. And if it changes in the back half of the year and you get a pipeline fill, well, that can change c the business in a hurry. But it's really too early to call. Back to your original question, we haven't seen anything noticeably different here in the last week or two. Heather Jones : And as a follow-up to that, so I read some things that were talking about restaurants like selling their inventory and all because they're not open and they're \u2013 they need to sell it or lease it. So you talked about the second half, potentially having a pipeline. So I mean, is it correct to think that you would have not only the pipeline still at the retail level, but a pipeline fill at foodservice? I mean, is that a \u2013 does that make sense to think of it that way? Jim Snee : Yes. I think when we're talking about the pipeline sales, I mean, we are thinking more of it from probably a foodservice perspective, since that is the bigger part of our business. If you've got people who are emerging from this quarantine that's locked down, one of the things that they probably will want to do in resuming their normal day-to-day life is going back to eating out. So yes, I think that's a good way to think about it. It's just the uncertainty around timing. Heather Jones : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : And now we will take our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ben Bienvenu : Thanks good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning Ben. Ben Bienvenu : Want to ask on the inventory side. For the last several quarters, you guys have leaned in to inventory a little bit and bought in advance of what you needed in light of opportunistic deflation in some of the primals that you typically buy buy. With bellies having been depressed as of late, what kind of opportunity does that give you? And when we look at the elevated, still elevated inventory in this quarter, can you just help us think about where your inventory sits today versus the comments you might have made a quarter ago? And to the extent you can talk across the primals, that would be helpful. Jim Snee : Certainly Ben. First of all we have been building inventory because of the transfer of production from Fremont into other facilities. So part of that has been just a safety stock, if you will, to make sure that if there's any slowdown in the start-up of those lines, we have plenty of inventory. But you're right, we have been building inventory in anticipation of higher ASF costs. In some cases, it's mitigated the cost like for trim for SPAM. In other cases, it's actually hurting the decrease of the belly prices. The belly prices that closed at $1.40 at the end of the first quarter are now down to $90. I mean, a $48 drop in those belly prices is not expected at this time frame.  So we'll continue to make decisions and determine case-by-case as to what we're seeing in the marketplace. This volatility that we're seeing is making it harder to tighten the market. About the time that you think that you've \u2013 this is the time to build inventory on belly or bacon, for instance, you see this kind of drop in bellies. And it's a difficult task, but we're staying on top of it and trying to use our best knowledge as to what to build and when to build it. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. And then asking a follow-up on Sadler's. It seems like a nice fit in your portfolio. How representative would this deal be of the types of additional deals that you would like to do, given the additional balance sheet capacity that you have? And then how representative would it be from a purchase price perspective and/or valuation of what the landscape looks like and with the pipeline of deals that you would be looking at? Nathan Annis : Yes, that\u2019s a tough one, Ben. Because, I mean, we evaluate these deals, the pipeline on a deal-by-deal basis. We've talked about our ability to do a bigger deal, and that remains. And are we willing to do a bigger deal? Absolutely. But it's got to be the right deal. And we've got to have it come to market, and you've got to be able to get it to the finish line. line. We like deals like the Sadler's deal, just like we like the Burke, like we like to Fontanini deal. The beauty of those deals is it really is a one-on-one negotiation. The relationships that we've built over time, they've been a supplier for over 20 years. So you really know the people, you know the business, they know us. So is it representative of the deals we like to do? Absolutely. And we can put it into a very strategic part of our business in foodservice. And so we're we like to do a bigger deal? Sure. Could we do a bigger deal? Absolutely. But if we have deals like Sadler's, Fontanini and Burke that come along on a regular basis, we'll take them all day, every day. Jim Snee : The item that I would add on this, Ben, is that it's not only the quality of the deal. But when you look at the purchase price, net of the tax benefit, you're talking about a deal that was done at an EBITDA multiple of about nine. And once we get through purchase accounting, we see this as a $0.02 to $0.04 per share accretive to the business. So it's not only a great strategic fit, but we were able to get this at a reasonable price. Ben Bienvenu : All right, great. Thanks for the comments. And good for the rest of the year. Jim Snee : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And now we'll take our next question from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Ken Zaslow : Hey good morning everyone. Just an overarching question first is, it seems like the commodity environment, though volatile, is lower than you would have expected. Does that mean that you will get the timing benefit later in the year, and generally, you should be in a tailwind? It just seems like if I go back to your original expectations across the board, you're in better shape than you started. Is that not a fair question, it was just a timing issue? Jim Snee : Well, we've talked about this before. When you're seeing this kind of volatility, it's going to move profitability between quarters. Even since the end of the first quarter quarter, you've seen the carcass value dropped $12 while hogs have only dropped $3. So we're getting into a more favorable market condition than we certainly had in the first quarter. Again, this was a very unusual market condition, especially with the structure in which we buy the majority of our raw materials, also basically the carcass value. We We didn't see the benefit of the lower spot market because we do not buy a majority of our raw materials that way. But still, we are profitable in the pork operating area. I think our structure is sound, we have built the inventories. We're trying to take advantage of our market. So we believe that we're in good shape going into the rest of the year. Ken Zaslow : I just would have thought you would have been a little bit more positive given the environment. But my second question is on grocery. Can you talk about \u2013 the profit came in lower than we would have expected? Can you talk about \u2013 are there trends within it? Is it the peanut butter side? What is really preventing this to regain its margin structure? Jim Snee : So Ken I\u2019ll just kind of tap on to the first question you asked today. And I think Jim gave a great answer to how we're thinking about it, your comment around you would have been more optimistic. I think the kicker in all of this is just that volatility that we saw in Q1 and how does that play out for the balance of the year. So we're in a good position, but we really can't predict that volatility.  Let's prod into Let's prod into the GP question. There's a lot of moving parts, as you can appreciate, and obviously, SPAM's off to a great start. As the trend continues, it will be our sixth consecutive record year of sales. We did make this shift in Chili, where we've moved some of the promotional activity into advertising to really support the brand, talk to consumers and we believe it's going to be a longer-term benefit for us and the retailers. So that's a work in process. MegaMex continues to perform well. You mentioned SKIPPY. And yes, SKIPPY is having a dramatic impact on the profitability of grocery products, and it's all tied back to the deflationary price action that was taken. And so that is still a work in process. I mean, our team is focused on customer by customer revenue growth management, making sure that we're effectively spending those trade dollars and having advertising to support the brand, continuous innovation. And then as we saw in the first quarter, we've got input costs. That volatility that can create noise late in the year.  But with all those moving pieces in GP. I mean the fact is we have work to do, right? We've got work to do to make sure that we keep SKIPPY on track. We have work to do to make sure that we execute this shift in the chili strategy. When we do that, mean, we'll achieve the results that I talked about in the fourth quarter, which was an increase year-over-year net of CytoSport. So I mean, like I said, there's a lot of moving parts. But we know we have work to do do, but the business still has a lot of favorable parts to think about. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you guys. Operator : Now we take our next question from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead your line is open. Robert Moskow : Hi there. Jim Snee : Hi Rob. Robert Moskow : I guess I\u2019m little confused as to how your \u2013 how did the next few quarters shape up significantly well enough to offset what, I think, was an operating profit miss in the first quarter. I don't see how Chili makes up for the \u2013 there's not going to be another Superbowl for the rest of the year. It sounds like SKIPPY \u2013 it sounds like you're saying that even though you're laughing last year's price increase, peanut butter will still be down in terms of profitability for the rest of the year. In Refrigerated, are you saying that just the commodity environment is just much more favorable now. You have better visibility in it. First quarter was just \u2013 it looked good for a while and then it didn't shape up the way you thought it would, but now it does. So is Refrigerated really carrying the day for the next few quarters? Jim Snee : Hi Robert, I think, going back to your opening comment, I mean, in total, our pretax earnings met our expectations for the first quarter. GP clearly did not meet our expectations. Refrigerated did, job succeeded. International was slightly below what we thought. But as we think about the rest of the year, we do think \u2013I get what you're saying about the Super Bowl, but the idea of making sure that, that business is not entirely focused at one part of the year, we know that consumers are using Chili throughout the year. We need to make sure that we're reminding them we're increasing that velocity and that frequency. So we do believe that that's an opportunity, and that's why we shifted the strategy. But Refrigerated Foods is going to be a critical piece for the balance of the year. Jennie-O Turkey Store remains a critical piece for the balance of the year. And we have nice momentum there. We got to do what we said we would do in GP for the balance of the year to get the results that I've talked about. And then really the wildcard, the uncertainty is International. And what happens, when does it happens, a lot of timing issues. So I mean as we think about the rest of the year, we actually \u2013 we feel good about the business, the fundamentals in Refrigerated, the momentum in Jennie-O Turkey Store. Jim, I don't know if there's anything you would add. Jim Sheehan : No, I mean you are right Rob that the market conditions have turned drastically in Refrigerated Foods. As you've seen, the cutout dropped $12, the spot market on hogs has only dropped $3. The market conditions that are unfavorable to the pure packer are favorable to us. And I think that's important. The important issue as we go into the future quarters. Really this is the market that we're structured for. Robert Moskow : Okay. All right. Got it now. And in fresh pork, did you say that it was profitable in the quarter? Was that the commentary? Jim Sheehan : Yes. Robert Moskow : Okay. Can you give us a rough estimate how much or just profitable is fine? Jim Sheehan : It was profitable and even in the market conditions that we are faced with, it was a very nice performance by the the pork operating group. Robert Moskow : Okay. All right. Well if you need maybe Chili during the summer, I do that. So I'm happy to help. So thank you. Jim Sheehan : Chili and chilidogs, so get them both, Rob. Robert Moskow : You got it half right there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we will go the the next question from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Jim Snee : Good morning. Michael Lavery :  When you look at the International segment, you've had such strong volume and sales growth, but obviously EBIT was down significantly. Can you just give a sense of how much that's a proxy for how a broader ASF outlook may \u2013 impact might look? And how would you compare and contrast what you expect in the business more broadly? Jim Snee : Yes, I think it's in line with what ASF impact would be. We saw a run up in raw material costs and we took corresponding pricing actions, which are always tough to get through as quickly as you'd like. And so we saw that in our business in China. We've been seeing that in the business in Brazil as product has been exported out and markets have moved up there as well. So I mean I think Q1 is probably a good proxy for what we would expect. I mean, the key is going to be that we take pricing and we all know that it takes time to get that pricing. And the pricing that we did take in China on retail and foodservice, as it has flowed through, up until the coronavirus, we didn't see a significant drop off in volumes. Michael Lavery : So I just want to make sure I understand your answer. So in the quarter you are reporting there's less coronavirus impact or very little. And it's just that the pricing hadn't come in, in the timing that covers the input cost pressure, so it's kind of that front end of the lag. Is not the right way to think about it? Jim Snee : That's exactly the way to think about it. Michael Lavery : Well, I guess, so what's next? I mean, this is obviously a pretty steep decline. How quickly does that rebound? And maybe in the hypothetical ex coronavirus view anyway, what would you expect? And maybe more importantly tying it to your Refrigerated Foods segment, how should we think about the parallels if you see that cost pressure flowing back here more broadly, would a 20% EBIT decline be the right expectation for that first quarter before the pricing really gets in place? Jim Snee : I don't know that you're \u2013 I don't know if you want to think about a direct correlation. I mean, you've had a lot of moving parts in China and there's still a lot of unanswered questions in terms of what's happening with their supply, their herd in China. I wouldn't use it as a direct proxy for the U.S. at all. As we think about what we're seeing domestically with pork production. Our pork production is expected to be up 4.5%, which essentially offsets the exports which are covering down ASF implications, right? They're going to be up 15% for 2020. So I don't know \u2013 I won't keep that isolated to China. I wouldn't carry that over to the U.S. Nathan Annis : No, this is isolated to China. As Jim said we're watching the fundamentals very closely. The increase in supplies and balance with the amount of exports that was expected, now I will point out that that level of export was really, earlier, we don't know what it will look like based on the conditions in China. There's record cold storage levels and so we think the fundamentals are solid domestically for the pork industry and are improving significantly for the turkey industry. Michael Lavery : And just a follow-up then, if you look at your description about the favorable conditions for Refrigerated Foods now, but the profit growth there is up, but pretty modest. How much acceleration should we expect? Is it going to be more likely to be more similar to this quarter or, what's the catalyst for fairly pushing that further in terms of say the balance of the year? Jim Snee : Again, here's what's difficult to forecast. Bellies were close to the \u2013 bellies at the beginning of the quarter and into the quarter were close to the same price, but they moved $70 during the quarter. It's that volatility that is creating a difficult environment to really forecast what the change is and how solid the change is. We have seen a lot of volatility, we believe, based on ASF. What we haven't seen as a long-term trend. And until you see the trend really develop, it's tough to manage this through the volatility. Jim Sheehan : And Mike, just at a higher level, as we've talked about a couple of times already. For the full, I mean, you think about Refrigerated Foods and JOTS delivering to offset the international downturn and then keep doing what we need to do. So, I mean Refrigerated Foods and JOTS will be important for us for the balance of the year. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thank very much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead your line is open. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I have two quick ones. So on the Jennie-O business, I just want to get a sense in terms of where we are in terms of regaining some of the distribution you lost last year. And then on the SKIPPY side, I understand obviously, you're still lapping some of the headwinds from last year but wanted to understand if there's any change in the competitive dynamics in the peanut butter shopper. Jim Snee : Yes. So the distribution gains, to answer your question, continue to be incremental, right? I mean, so the team is doing a really nice job gaining back distribution, retailer by retailer. One of the things that we've talked about a couple of quarters ago that continues to play out is that we are seeing up four percentage points better growth in retailers who are selling and distributing the Jennie-O brand. And so as we're out telling the story to regain the distribution, it's a really good to be told. And our team is doing that and it's an incremental game. We said it's going to take some time, but as you can see in the results, it's really playing out. And then, we haven't seen any additional change to competitive activity since the deflationary pricing actions. As we said, we're lapping that coming at the end of Q2. And so we are hopeful that we can return to a sense of normalcy and growing the business that we do in terms of innovating, brand building and driving the business the way we know-how. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : And now we will take our next question from Eric Larson from Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead your line is open. Eric Larson : Yes, thanks everyone. I know we're running out of time, so I'll make it pretty quick. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Jim Snee : No problem. Eric Larson : The recovery in JOTS is actually really encouraging. I think it's been the longest down cycle in Turkey that I've seen in a long time. So can you give us a little better flavor, just to dive a little deeper into the recovery, have we seen actual capacity reductions by the industry? Obviously, we're seeing placements and egg sets and stuff going down, but is it for real? And are the competitors more rational than what we've seen maybe in the past year? Just a little more detail and that would be helpful. Jim Snee : Yes, I think the key thing there, Eric and you talked about is really the fundamentals, right? I mean we're seeing favorable fundamentals, which would be driven by the entire industry. So how they\u2019re doing, what they're doing, when they're doing will all feed into fundamentals. That's what we're watching. And we do see those positive trends. You add to that the excellent results across our supply chain, and live production, and manufacturing, combined with the incremental gains on regaining distribution, that's why we're a bit optimistic when we talked about the momentum that the business has. Eric Larson : Okay. And then I may have missed this this is my follow-up. You may have already stated this, but when do you actually lap year-over-year the the deflation that you saw in peanut butter pricing? Jim Snee : That's at the end of Q2.. Eric Larson : End of Q2. So Q3 will be more \u2013 will be at least apples-to-apples on that factor? Jim Snee : Exactly, we should start getting a clearer read on the business. Eric Larson : Okay. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes thanks Eric. Operator : Thank you. And now we take our next question from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Thanks. And thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe clarification questions. In Refrigerated, you alluded the higher commodity profits. In the past, you've given some dimension to changes in commodity profits. Any way you can frame that this quarter? And also, you said you took out some hedging losses on odds [ph] is any freight way to frame kind of what that \u2013 the impact of that was? Jim Sheehan : Well the commodity margins or the commodity margins, the pork operating margins were in line with our long-term profile. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then in the Refrigerated business and the commentary both in the press release and on the call today. Didn't hear any mention of Columbus or Fontanini. Just characterization of how those businesses have been progressing.? Jim Sheehan : Sure. Okay. Thanks for bringing those up. And we just have a lot of other things to talk about. Been very pleased with the work being done by our deli group, specifically with the Columbus brand. We got a great holiday season with the Columbus, you probably saw the announcement that we're building a new facility in Omaha, Nebraska to support the growth of that brand. And so things are going really well. Same thing with Fontanini. We put in a new line there last year because we needed to expand the capacity. Our food service team has really taken that business and run with it just the way we designed the strategy. So both those businesses are very healthy and in great shape. Adam Samuelson : I appreciate the color. Thank you. Jim Sheehan : Thanks Adam. Operator : Thank you. And now we take our last question from Rebecca Scheuneman from Morningstar. Rebecca Scheuneman : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing in. So real quick on the lower profit margins in the grocery products segment is there any way you can somewhat quantify the different factors that you talk about the divestiture having an impact, lower volumes, lower contract manufacturing, higher raw material costs, et cetera. Is there any way you can kind of help quantify that? And related to that I believe that when you talked about the CytoSport divestiture, you said that the operating margins were slightly lower than the corporate average, which would mean that they're definitely lower than the segment. So I would think it would be margin accretive the divestiture unless you're talking about standard overhead or something in that regard. So just some clarity there would be great. Thanks. Jim Snee : Yes, the two biggest issues are the impact of the contract manufacturing business, that has been a difficult business. And then the second part would be the run-up in the raw material costs for the segment. So the focus really are the two things. Really, in terms of your second part of your question we can have Mason follow-up here to give you a little more detail. But there's really not anything of any magnitude that are impacting it, left over from the CytoSport divestiture. But we'll have him follow-up with you Rebecca. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. Sounds great. And just real quick then, so the contract manufacturing is that something that's going to drag throughout the remainder of the year? Jim Snee : Yes, I mean we've seen that recently trend trend down. Just as a reminder, it's not a business that is I'll say strategic for us, it has been more of a capacity play. And so it does ebb and flow but the key takeaway is that it has trended down in it and it's been a difficult business. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. It's appears that there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Snee, I'd like to turn the call back to you for any additional crossings remarks. Jim Snee : Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We are off to a solid start in Q1 and we know that we must continue to execute our plan for the balance of the year. To our team members online, my sincere thanks for everything, all of you do to keep our company uncommon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

First off, I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to the essential workers showing up everyday in food manufacturing facilities across the industry. They should be recognized for the heroic and purposeful work they are doing and they have my most sincere appreciation and gratitude. I also want to acknowledge the food industry employees for showing their commitment everyday with the work they do, whether in a grocery stores, food pantries, restaurants serving patrons or takeout, delivery or curbside pick-up. And of course, a big thank you to the healthcare workers and first responders who are keeping all of us safe. Throughout this pandemic, our number one priority has been to keep our team members safe, especially those who are not in a position to work remotely. Our COVID leadership team including operations, quality control, communications, legal, R&D, and human resources have worked tirelessly to ensure we have the appropriate enhanced safety measures in place, including personal protective equipment for all plant team members, temperature and wellness screenings, frequent disinfecting of high touch areas, reconfiguration of common areas and workstations, revised shift scheduling, reducing production line speeds, new guidelines on carpooling, more extensive social distancing measures throughout each facility and wherever possible providing remote work opportunities and improved access to COVID-19 testing. I am continually amazed in our management team's ability to find innovative ways to enhance employee safety in our facilities. Throughout this crisis, we have also been transparent with our team and the public about all we are doing to put safety first. As part of our industry-leading safety measures, we have also developed an awareness campaign we call \"Keep COVID Out,\" a program that reinforces various preventative measures at our production facilities and in the communities where we live and work. As a global branded food company, we play a critical role in providing safe, high-quality food during this unprecedented time. As we all know, it has not been business as usual over the past several weeks, and we will likely be in this new normal for some time. I'm very proud of how all our team members have stepped up and reacted to the rapidly changing dynamics in our industry. Before I get into the quarterly results, I want to take a moment to tell you a few things about our approach over the last several weeks that really stand out for me. I told our team that we were made for this and the following are examples of what really makes us the company so uncommon. As we progressed into the initial stages of the pandemic, our senior leadership team agreed that we would do everything we could to protect the jobs of our thousands of team members. Each day, I heard examples of our supply chain team going above and beyond to shift production between plants or relocate where certain jobs could be done. In many cases, these changes had never been done before. Balancing workloads across plants in a manner we did was not the most cost-effective decision, but it was the right decision. Another example of what makes this company uncommon is our commitment to making the best long-term decisions for our team members, suppliers, customers, and shareholders. Because of our stable cash flows and strong balance sheet, we will not neglect any strategic investments during this uncertain time. We have completed a comprehensive review of our capital projects, and in some cases have slightly delayed project completion because the additional capacity isn't needed right now. However, we continue to move forward with many investments that will enhance our long-term performance. One such investment is Project Orion. Our team's ability to effectively and efficiently work remotely has allowed us to keep Project Orion on track, and we have made the decision to go live on our financial system update in June. I know everyone on our finance team is committed to making the important cutover a success. We are confident we will see the benefits from our financial system go live just as we are seeing from our HR system upgrade completed in January. I also want to take a few minutes to highlight key areas that are helping us weather the storm. First, our creation of One Supply Chain supply chain three years ago has been instrumental in helping us manage this crisis from one pivot point at an executive level. The quick decisions we made early on could not have been made in the same way if we were operating four or five different supply chains. Second, the significant investments we made several years ago in our ecommerce team, infrastructure, and capabilities positioned us to quickly grow in this emerging channel. During the quarter, our tracked purchases through IRI were up over 100% and our brands are significantly outpacing category growth and capturing market share in many categories across both center store and perimeter. Finally, our decision late last year to transition the entire enterprise to one IT platform made virtual coordination much easier than it otherwise would have been. While our decision to transition right before the pandemic was serendipitous, our IT Services Group deserves a lot of credit for seamlessly transitioning thousands of team members to working remotely in less than a week. Now looking at our sales results for the quarter, the balance we have purposely built into our business is a competitive advantage that has allowed us to perform well in many different economic situations, including the current crisis. For the quarter, volume increased 4% and organic volume increase 7%. We delivered record sales for the quarter with an increase of 3%. Organic sales increased 6%, and three of our four segments delivered increases in sales. From a channel perspective, total retail sales increased 16% during the quarter. We saw multiple different waves of demand in our retail businesses as the pandemic has unfolded. In the first wave, we saw tremendous demand for nearly all of our center store brands. Our initial assessment was consumers were stocking up, but as the weeks progressed, we continue to see sustained double-digit increases. The second wave of demand took place as shelter-in-place restrictions were enacted across the country, and consumers shifted from dining and restaurants to purchasing more perishable products across the perimeter of the store. We continue to see perimeter sales increase at double-digit rates over last year. Throughout the escalation in demand, we've seen a large increase in the number of new buyers and households purchasing our branded products. What I'm particularly proud about is the number of new buyers that are making repeat purchases of our brands. This is an important leading indicator as consumers are using our products, enjoying the experience, and repurchasing our brands. I'm also encouraged by our team's ability to capture, share in channels that were open and available namely the retail channel. From a total company perspective, we significantly outperformed the category, private label, other large brands, and small brands. Our ability to capture market share is a testament to our brands and direct sales force, and also to our operations and supply chain teams\u2019 ability to ensure our products are on the shelf. One dynamic from the pandemic that is affecting all of us is what is happening across the foodservice industry. It's heartbreaking to see distributors, restaurants, hotels, and many other foodservice venues struggle to survive. I've seen estimates of thousands of restaurants across the United States could close as a result of this crisis. Every entrepreneur behind each restaurant has a unique story of why and how they chose to open their restaurant. Many of these restauranteurs are community members trying to make their neighborhood a better place to live and work, and these closings are tragic. Our foodservice divisions have been doing their part to help the foodservice industry. Within days of the crisis, our Hormel Food Service Group offered a rebate program to help offset operators' food costs. This program was successful and exceeded our expectations. We're also working very closely with our distributor partners to support their needs and have recently received accolades for our efforts. And finally, we've talked a great deal about how our direct sales force is a distinct competitive advantage and no time is that more true than right now. Our sales team has been on the virtual frontlines, helping operators quickly adjust to take out delivery and curbside pickup with best in class guides and kits, and sometimes being the only supplier to personally check in with the restauranteur during this difficult time. Like others in the industry, we saw a sharp decline in our foodservice business starting in late March. For the quarter, our enterprise foodservice sales were down 21%. As you think about our domestic foodservice business, it is primarily sold through the Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store segments. Prior to the outbreak, our foodservice business represented approximately 40% of sales in both segments and a majority of our operator customers are in key segments, such as midscale and casual dining, lodging, K-12 schools, colleges and universities and healthcare. Each foodservice segment is experiencing different dynamics during the shelter-in-place restrictions, and each will have a different recovery timeline coming out of the pandemic. Even though it is early in the third quarter, we are starting to see orders pick up across our foodservice businesses. From a financial perspective, we delivered earnings per share of $0.42; Jim Sheehan will provide more details of the moving pieces, but I do want to mention that our earnings fully reflect $0.05 per share in investment losses and increased supply chain costs related to COVID-19. The high level dynamic during the quarter was similar in each segment. Namely, demand shifts from foodservice to retail at higher operational costs. However, each segment did experience some unique circumstances, and I want to highlight those areas. Grocery products volume increase 7% and sales increased 8%. Organic volume increased 19% and organic sales increased 20%. We saw exceptional growth from nearly every brand, with some products delivering very strong double-digit growth including the SPAM family of products, SKIPPY peanut butter, and Hormel chili. Two keys to grocery product success during the quarter was the sales and marketing teams focus on limiting production to our priority, high volume items and frequent conversations with our customers regarding assortment and product availability. We know our center store brands are perfectly suited for value consumers who need affordable high quality products for their families. With millions of Americans now unemployed, or shelf stable products are as important to consumers as they've ever been. Earnings for grocery products increased 22% despite the divestiture of CytoSport for last year. Strong volumes and improved mix were the key drivers to the double-digit increase. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered a strong quarter with volumes up 19%, sales up 12% and a segment profit of 54%. Strong retail, whole-bird and commodity sales more than offset declines in food service. The Jennie-O sales and marketing group made excellent progress regaining distribution prior to the pandemic, which puts them in a strong position to succeed. During the quarter, Jennie-O lean ground turkey sales increased by double digits. Higher sales and operational improvements across the supply chain are the key drivers to earnings growth. International volume decreased 2% and sales increased 2%. Branded exports primarily SPAM offset declines in our China food service business. Segment profits increased 62% due to higher branded export margins and increased income from affiliates. I'm pleased to report our China plants operations are now fully up and running to support our retail and food service businesses as the country continues on its path for reopening. Our food service business in China is improving off the lows we saw during the pandemic and we are seeing very strong demand for SPAM, SKIPPY and our refrigerated products at retail. The team in China is working through higher pork prices, but are taking the necessary pricing actions to offset cost increases. Refrigerated foods volume was flat and organic volume was down 1%. Sales increased 1% and organic sales declined 3%. Retail demand was led by products such as Hormel Black Label bacon, Applegate natural and organic products, Columbus grab-and-go charcuterie and Hormel pepperoni. We also finalized the acquisition of Sadler's Smokehouse during the quarter. The majority of Sandler's sales are into the food service channel. But I've been impressed by the way in which this team has quickly pivoted their production to meet the growing needs in retail. One unique trend we are seeing in the marketplace is consumers searching for products that can replace a restaurant experience. Brand like Sadler's Smokehouse and Lloyd's barbeque fit that need perfectly. In fact, our retail lines at Sadler's and Lloyd's have been operating at capacity to meet the demand for their products. Our food service business saw double-digit declines during the quarter. However, we are very confident that as the food service industry starts to open up, our product lines featuring precooked, pre-sliced and pre-marinated products will thrive as operators look to simplify preparation and reduce handling of products. Our deli business experienced customer dynamics that were a blend between retail and food service. Products like Columbus grab-and-go charcuterie performed well as consumers searched for unique and flavorful products. We can see declines in the behind the glass and prepared food businesses, as many retailers closed these areas to redeploy labor to other sections of the store. Earnings were down 17% to the lower food service sales and higher operational costs as we paused production at two plants during the quarter. Jim Sheehan will provide more details regarding input cost volatility the refrigerated foods team experienced during the quarter. As we look forward, we are withdrawing our full year sales and earnings guidance. The decision to withdraw guidance reflects uncertainty created by COVID-19 in several key areas, including consumer behavior at retail and food service, volatility and our input costs and supply chain disruptions. Our team is focused on these indicators to guide our decisions and investments in the coming weeks and months. First, we are paying close attention to consumer behavior across our entire portfolio. We are watching consumer buying patterns in the retail channel with metrics such as household penetration and repeat rates. We're also watching how consumers emerge from shelter and place restrictions across the country and reengage the food service industry. In addition to monitoring restaurant traffic, we're observing how other segments in the food service industry, such as lodging, colleges and universities, and K through 12 education reopen. We're also actively managing through the volatility we're seeing in raw material markets. As I mentioned, Jim Sheehan will provide a detailed assessment of the hog and pork industry of the recent periods of operational pause and start-up in processing facilities across the industry are creating dramatic swings in input costs. I have the highest confidence in our ability to pass along the necessary pricing, but we may experience short-term margin compression, or expansion as raw material markets adjust to the rapid changes in supply and demand. Finally, while we have implemented industry leading safety measures, we have experienced operational challenges at some of our facilities due to COVID-19. And we are strategically managing through operational disruptions on a daily basis. These operational disruptions have led to incremental supply chain costs. During the second quarter, our costs increased by approximately $20 million primarily related to team member bonuses, enhanced safety measures and lower production volumes. In the second half, we expect to incur another $60 million to $80 million of incremental costs that are temporary and these costs will be weighted to the third quarter. In closing, I want to emphasize three points. First, our company was built for this. We have the right strategy, sound business fundamentals, best in class management and the financial strength to thrive in this dynamic marketplace. Second, we will not do anything to jeopardize our strong financial position. We are well-equipped to weather this storm and will be stronger because of it. Third, we have said from the very beginning of this pandemic, that our goal was to do our best to do everything right. From people safety to supporting our partners and customers to ensuring America has food on its shelves to donating millions of dollars and millions of meals to hunger related causes. Everything we are doing is in perfect alignment with our purpose of inspired people, inspired food. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, provide commentary regarding key input cost markets and an update on our financial position. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Net sales increased 3% to $2.4 billion, a record for the second quarter. Organic sales were up 6%. Segment profit increased 5% to $310 million as double-digit growth from grocery products Jennie-O turkey store and international more than offset a decline in refrigerated foods. Pretax earnings were $286 million down 10%. Excluding the CytoSport gain last year, adjusted pretax earnings declined 5%. This decrease included significant losses on investments. The effective tax rate was 20.6% compared to 11.1% last year. Last year's rate benefited from a tax gain on the CytoSport sale. Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42 down 19%. Adjusted earnings per share was down 9%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased year-over-year. Lower expenses last year were due primarily to the gain from the CytoSport sale. Advertising for the quarter was $35 million flat to last year. Net unallocated expenses for the quarter increased $46 million. The increase was due primarily to $16 million related to the CytoSport pretax gain and $19 million in lower investment results from last year. Operating margins were 12.1% compared to 13.3% last year. Additional costs included the import investments in COVID-19 related employee safety measures and production professional bonuses. Both reflect our commitment to our production professionals and ensuring their safety. The company continued to generate strong and stable cash flows despite the impact of COVID-19. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow more than doubled in the quarter compared to the prior year. We recently renewed our shelf stable registration statement and are considering near-term opportunities to access the debt market, at favorable interest rates to provide ample liquidity to take advantage of strategic opportunities. The company's strong cash flow and balance sheet along with the investment grade credit rating allows us to manage risk, as well as make strategic and long-term investments to drive shareholder return even in times of uncertainty. We are confident we will remain in a strong position to fund our capital needs, including the dividend, capital expenditures and pension contributions as we grow the business. We paid our 367th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15 at an annual rate of $0.93 per share, and 11% increase over 2019. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $80 million compared to $48 million last year. Large projects for the remainder of the year include the Burke pizza topping plant expansion, a new dry sausage facility and Project Orion. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2020 is $340 million. We completed the purchase of Sandler's Smokehouse for $269 million during the quarter using cash on hand. Share repurchases in the quarter were $12 million representing 300,000 shares. We repurchased stock to offset dilution from stock option exercises, and based on our internal valuation. The quarter was impacted by contrasting dynamic forces. Within an 8-week period, the industry experienced the decline in food service demand, creating an oversupply of protein. This was quickly followed by plant disruptions which resulted in significant protein shortages. At the peak in early May, the industry was operating at 40% below capacity. The changing dynamics of supply and demand cost are swings in hogging commodity values, which have continued into the third quarter. To illustrate the volatility, the USDA composite cutout declined 40% from March 23 to April 9. Since April 9, prices have increased by as much as 140% to levels that's been since DEDV in 2014. Likewise, bellies have traded between $40 and $270 per hundredweight since the beginning of April. These trim traded at both 10-year lows and 10-year highs over the same period. The most recent USDA supply and demand report estimates a 1% decline in hog production for the year after estimating a 5% increase in the prior month's report. We feel the hog in commodity values in the near-term will be determined by industry processing capacity. Additional plant disruptions will depress hog values and increase commodity values. Alternatively, if the industry is capable of operating at near capacity levels, hog prices and commodity values should moderate. Worldwide demand for pork remains strong. We continue to monitor African swine fever in China, Southeastern Asia and Europe. According to the USDA exports are expected to increase greater than 10%. In the near-term, we are closely analyzing two key factors, hog processing levels and consumer confidence as restaurants reopen. We are currently using multiple predictive analytic models to monitor and forecast both factors. We are actively managing industry capacity issues by leveraging the three ways we source raw materials; internal processing, contracted sourcing and purchasing primals on the open market. The supply chain strategy is designed to mitigate volatility. The margins could expand and contract as pricing lags changes in cost. This can shift profitability between quarters. Fundamentals in the turkey industry were mixed in the second quarter, but recent data indicates improving conditions. Consistent with the pork industry in the near-term, we are focused on the ability to maintain turkey operations in the industry and at our facilities. Four placements in the last six weeks have experienced meaningful declines. This should continue to reduce cold storage levels, which had already significantly declined. We expect whole-bird pricing to remain elevated compared to last year for the remainder of the year. Turkey breast pricing was significantly lower in the second quarter, but pricing is improved in the third quarter. We successfully implemented the Oracle Human Capital Management System of Project Orion in January. As Jim Snee said our team is credited with advancing Project Orion as we work remotely with minimal project delays. We are proceeding with the finance go-live in June. Our team is already benefiting from enhanced analytics and improved demand planning. In June, we will introduce additional capacities such as robotic process automation and real-time data integration. Further implementation for the supply chain will take place later in 2020 and 2021. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : You gave some helpful detail on what you're seeing in the hog and pork market. I just wanted to ask about how that translates to your results as you kick off the quarter, right? It would sound, I guess on the lean hog side prices down quite a bit, but you guys historically have not always seen your costs track as closely just given your negotiated purchases. And then, on the more input cost side, you're seeing some pretty substantial increases. So are you kind of messaging that the quarter is going to start-off a little bit slower from a profit standpoint, and then you would look to adjust pricing and kind of recapture those input costs or did I miss here? Jim Sheehan : First of all, the most important thing on pricing is going to be the ability to keep the plants running and the processing capacity and right now that seems to be happening. But there's great deal of uncertainty as to what plants are going to be had and the volume impact those interruptions will have. So that's the most important thing as you look at our quarter that can create the volatility that you've talked about. The other thing that's happening in the industry is that primals or items raw materials don't require additional processing are much more expensive than the less processed items. My example would be hams right now are running at about $35, but 72% trim today is 125. Normally, you would take those hams and you'd bone them because of that price discrepancy in the two items. And you'd bone the hams for trim, but right now it's hard to find the labor with the absenteeism that's in the plants to do that boning. So there's a quite a bit of diversity in the pricing of the primals right now. As far as hog prices today, hog prices are at about $39 says the western Corn Belt. And last quarter, our pricing for hogs were not far off of the average Western Corn Belt I think was about mid-50s 54 and 55 in that range. The only thing that was a bit above average for us were grain based contracts. And so, hog pricing for us is not out of line of what you're seeing in the Western Corn Belt. We're watching the input costs greatly and you're seeing the volatility. I mean, take a look at 72% trim. It was as low as $34 in the second quarter went as high as $145 in the second quarter. That comparison gets to $68 price today and it's at 125. You've got bellies that range from $41 at the low to 267 at the high averaged about 113. And it's dropped to $94, just the last week. So it's really hard to read the -- or estimate the primal values, raw material costs. But watch what's happening on the plant performance. Again, as I said before, if we're able to keep players both the industry and our plants running at about capacity, we think there'll be a moderation in both hog prices and overall primal values. Hope that helps. Tom Palmer : And then just wanted to ask on the Jennie-O side, the volume growth, I think, traditionally, about three quarters of your product has been internally supplied. I'd be surprised if you were able to move slaughter volumes by as much as that segment volumes were up. So could you talk about your purchases this quarter, any changes to inventory levels, and then how you're thinking about kind of a mix versus slaughter and purchases going forward? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, obviously, we're quite pleased with the quarter that JOTS had, really good work, coming off of -- coming out of our first quarter call, we talked about what they had done in distribution and really what they've continued to do, especially on lean ground turkey. They've been able to really move through some of that inventory, because we've had -- the business has been driven across the entire portfolio. So whether it was retail, whole-birds, commodities, it's been a really, really good mix of products that have put them in a great position in the quarter. In regards to some of the actual harvest volumes and some of those questions, we'll have Nathan follow-up with you on that, that level of detail, but just overall really strong demand across many areas. Good quarter for JOTS. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from Heather Jones. Heather Jones : Just wondering when you talk about food service in the refrigerated foods business. I guess a two part question. Just wondering if you could give us a sense of what proportion of that is like the QSRs or pizza takeout chains versus like the hotels, institutions business? And then, the second part of the question is, we talk about you start to see this demand come back, if you could just give us some sense of the magnitude of recovery you're seeing. Jim Snee : Thanks Heather the question. Our food service business was off to a great start this year and in the quarter. We saw some really strong growth through mid-March. And then a sharp decline through the end of quarter, we talked about business being down 21%. And as we think about the channels where we compete, we have a very balanced food service business. And so you think about lodging, colleges, universities, K through 12, midscale casual chains, really, really nice balance. When you talk about QSR, if you're talking about traditional burger chains, probably don't have a lot of business there. But if you think about locations that still have drive thru business available to them. We have quite a bit of business in that channel, if you want to call it that. And so very balanced model across food service and as we're starting out the third quarter and we talked about, it's early, we're seeing some demand pick up. The part that is really hard to read at this point, we'll be watching closely. Is that pipeline fill or is it true consumer demand, so we're certainly not spiking the ball. We know we're going to have to watch it closely over the weeks and months ahead, but from where we sit, we feel like we're well positioned. We talk about our direct sales force that's able to pivot and get out in front of operators as their world has changed dramatically. The products that we've spent years and years creating Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Bacon 1, Cafe H, all so well positioned for this new environment. And so obviously, we got to watch what happens with capacity, patron comfort level, the speed and magnitude of rebounds. So lots of uncertainty there. But, when it's all said and done, we've got an amazing food service group that I know put us in a great position to win. Heather Jones : Thank you. And then, my second question is on, Jim Sheehan, you mentioned utilization of the plants, for the industry and for Hormel, if one of you could give us a sense of, with the CDC guidelines, et cetera. What do you think over the next 6 to 12 months is the feasible max utilization for these plants trying to end. And are you guys having issues with getting labor to the bone in hands or would you be able to take advantage of those cheap pan costs for your trim? Jim Snee : Heather, I'll go ahead and take that one. I mean, I think the thing to remember, in our facilities, we don't own any of the harvest facilities. So as you think about our processing plants, it is a different business. And so yes, we do have some lines, some areas where it is hard to socially distance. Our team has done an amazing job putting in those enhanced safety measures and really meeting or exceeding CDC and OSHA guidelines. In those plants, I mean, we've seen some lines have to slow down. But I wouldn't say that it's anything that's going to have a dramatic impact on the business long-term, that the shorter term issue is as you do have more and more positive cases and you get some absenteeism, that's the short-term issue that really is impacting the capacity in some of these plants. And so, we're in a much better place in terms of understanding how to manage through the process. All of our plants are up and running today. And really one of the keys as we've progressed through this pandemic is the fact that additional testing has really allowed us to maintain the understanding of what's happening and who's positive, who is negative, who has to sit out until can come back to work. So having more testing widely available is really been a great thing. And I think you'll continue to see that via a benefit as we'd like to maintain our operations. Operator : We'll take our next question from Erica Eiler with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. You talked a little bit about what you're seeing in the food service channel here so far early in Q3. Is there any color you can provide and what you're seeing within the retail channel lately? Jim Snee : Sure. We've continued to see very strong dynamic, strong business in the retail channel, both in the center of the store and on the perimeter of the store. We've been really pleased with what's happened in grocery products as we've been able to add households, bring new consumers into the mix. I would say early on in the crisis, there was this view that it was all just stocking up or pantry loading. But over time, we've seen the velocity, we've seen a sustained demand. So we know that there's a lot of new buyers and stronger new buyer repeat percentage. So that has held up on the retail side of the business, both center of the store and the perimeter. Erica Eiler : Okay, great. And just given the challenges in food service, due to this unprecedented environment. Can you talk about, your ability to convert some of your food service supply into the grocery retail channel and some of the things you've been doing on this front? Jim Snee : Yes. Early on, I mean, we had our retail team collaborating with our food service team and where there were opportunities to repack products. We certainly took advantage of that, the governments eased some of the labeling requirements, which was a positive as we were able to move more products into the channel. But then, the demand was so great, we had a number of retailers who were less concerned about maybe the retail packaging and just wanting product available for shelf. So we started to sell food service packed items into retail channels as well. So it's really been a little bit of everything in terms of converting some food service lines into retail, moving food service product into retail, all with this idea of how are we helping retailers meeting the increased demand. Operator : Your next question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : When you work from the new COVID-19 environment or the new normal however you want to put it? Well, Hormel's earnings strength is stronger or weaker or the same and what financial measures we use, think about when you emerging and how do you frame it? Jim Snee : It's a great question, Ken. When you say when you emerge, clearly you have to take out the next few quarters, just based on the uncertainty that we talked about and really the industry is talking about. From our perspective, we're thinking two plus years out and what we are really confident in is this balanced model that we've intentionally and purposefully built and talked about tirelessly over the last number of years. And it's so important, because it really allows us to meet the consumer wherever they choose to go. And so, in the midst of this crisis, obviously, you had food service operations shutting down so the consumer behavior was forced. But they had to choose perimeter, center of the store and we were there front and center, right? Center store perimeter, deli, ecommerce and so we feel really good about the balanced business model we've created. The other thing that we feel really good about is the way that we've been able to provide value, variety and versatility across this entire portfolio. And so again, as the consumer evolves out of this crisis where are they going to go with the number of unemployed Americans now, value is a more important certainly in the shorter term than it's ever been. And we're there. And then, if there is a consumer trend that emerges in a big way that maybe we're not competing today. This balance sheet that we talked about that Jim Sheehan referenced, I mean, it really allows us to quickly pivot and become competitive either by building or buying. And so we remain very bullish on our earnings power over the long-term as you would imagine, but I think there's some really good data and support behind why we feel so bullish. And so lots of great opportunities in the short-term, but we think we're well positioned over the long-term as well, hopefully, that's helpful Ken. Ken Zaslow : I guess what I'd say is, to what extent do you think the cost structure will increase in the permanent and if food service loses, say 2 to 500 basis points? Are you in a better position or worst position, I guess, is kind of what I'm. And you did also mention, there are -- you potentially taking on more debt for strategic opportunities? What does that mean? So again, I get the three or four part question and I'll leave it there. Jim Snee : Yes. No, I mean, it's a great question. But again, if food service does have a permanent decline where does that go, right? And so does it go to our grocery products organization? Is it going into more fresh meat? I mean that part is so real, really too early to tell in terms of what is the more permanent consumer behavior. We need to see that play out over time. I think what we're really trying to say is, no matter where it goes, we'll be there to be able to capitalize on it. I mean, our goal, obviously, is to maintain and return to the business that we have, because obviously we know that our food service business is very competitively managed. In terms of, what we talked about some of the short-term financial opportunities. I mean, clearly, we don't know what's going to happen as this crisis keeps dragging on. And so we just want to make sure, a) that we're well positioned not only for our existing business, but if opportunities arise to be able to quickly take advantage of it. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Ken. Regarding the debt, we do have some debt $250 million that matures in April of next year, so it's within one year. Obviously, interest rates are very favorable right now, we think that there will be an interest in Hormel in the market. So we think that those favorable interest rates will be passed on to us, if we decide to go out there. And as Jim said, we want to be well positioned for any opportunities that exist during this time period and as we come out of this time period to pivot and take advantage of those markets that may provide opportunities either new markets or existing markets where we can expand whether by building within that structure or acquiring. Operator : Our next question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Jim Snee : I'm not sure if the caller is there. Nathan Annis :  Operator you can move to the next person in the queue. Operator : One moment please. Nathan Annis : Operator, are you able to move to the next person in the queue? Operator : It appears my -- technical difficulties. Nathan Annis : Operator, are you still having tough technical difficulties? Operator : Yes. One moment while I pick up. Nathan Annis : To all the listeners, please stand by our operator is having technical difficulties. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Peter Galbo, please go ahead with your question. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys, can you hear me? Jim Snee : Yes, we can. Peter Galbo : Jim, thanks again for the help just kind of in thinking about, the three different ways that your source. I guess I just want to focus in on kind of the sourcing of primals. I think a few years ago, you would given a number that it's around $700 million to $900 million annually that you kind of purchased externally, in a given basis. I just want to make sure that's still a good number and maybe forgetting about kind of the inflation and pricing you've seen for a moment. Has the ability to physically secure supply of product at least improve it all from, say kind of the end of April through the first couple of weeks in May? And I have a follow up as well. Jim Snee : Certainly. I think that's what you're seeing, as I said, you saw bellies at 267 during the depth of the decline in operations and now they're back at $94. And you're seeing the movement as plants come online and start to understand how to operate at this. At this level, you're seeing those prices decrease, obviously, those are market prices. Right now, we're not doing a lot of buying on the open market. The products that we're getting through our internal sources and our contracted sources are providing enough volume for us as you've seen the decline in the food service industry, the demand from the food service industry. Again, it depends on what items you're looking for as to how easy they are, a very bone and ham, you can find any place but again, that's you have to find an operation that has the ability to source if you're looking for trim. So it takes some work, but we've been doing this for a long time. We have a highly skilled staff that have long relationships and I think suppliers who appreciate operating with Hormel, so those relationships have helped us through this process. You've seen this in the beef industry where you have beef 50s that have been as high as 326. But as operations have come back online, there are 198. So it's something that you have to be skilled at, but it's something that we're able to handle. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. And then, just the second question, the retail sales number that you quoted, above 16%, kind of seems to imply that maybe you under shipped consumption relative to what we saw in the scanner data. Was there any inventory drawdown on the part of the retailer or some of your distribution partners that we would have seen or is it really that we should expect to kind of see a pipeline may fail, so to speak, going in to the third quarter? Jim Snee : Again, it's early in the third quarter, but so far our retail business both center of the store and the perimeter is holding up and it's strong. I think from an inventories perspective, any inventory retailers have and any inventory that we add on some of the high volume items, those are pretty well cleared and you're dealing with all current production levels. Our IRI data is still really, really strong and we could share in a number of categories again both perimeter and center of the store. So really pleased about where the business is, the part that we've touched on in our comments that we're also really pleased with is our ecommerce business. We made significant investments a couple years ago. And we've seen those investments pay-off very strong growth, capturing share, not only brick and mortar but virtually. And we think we'll continue to see that as a growth engine as consumers continue to get comfortable shopping online, whether it's delivery or click and collect. So I would say retail business across the board in store ecommerce all really strong Peter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So, I guess first question, we have a clarification. The $20 million, the cost -- of switching costs incurred in the quarter, and $60 million to $80 million expected to incur, over the balance of the fiscal year, just to help us think about where those actually fell in the segment's perspective, just we can understand kind of how the comps play out next year, most of them up. Jim Sheehan : So in the second quarter, most of that cost came within JOTS and refrigerated foods. Our refrigerated foods had a little bit higher percentage and that had to do with some early interruptions and processing that we saw in a refrigerated foods and then it was followed later by some additional safety measures that we talked and to be very honest, we set a priority of employee safety and we didn't do a lot of negotiation when it came time to going out getting the protective gear or taking other actions we acted quickly. So that we could provide that assurance to our employees. As we go forward, I think that you're going to look at it as to the volume of operations and refrigerated foods and grocery products, we'll both see a portion of that expense, probably the highest footfall within refrigerated foods, then Jennie-O and then grocery products, if you think about it, roughly but it's a changing dynamic. That's what we expect right now, but with the uncertainty that's going on in any operations right now it could shift. Jim Snee : An add-on. I mean, just remember, the plant pauses started at the end of Q2, really, the majority that we've seen are in Q3. Jim referenced, the lower volumes, lower tonnages, don't forget that we've paid significant team member bonuses as well. So, the good news is right now all of our plants are up and running. Adam Samuelson : All that makes sense. Thank you. And then, my second question is in the grocery business where you've had this big surge in sales for legacy candy business, for peanut butter, how are you thinking about kind of how much inventory is in consumer pantries at this point and kind of anything over as you get into little parts of the year and that gets drawn down? Or do you think that the surge in retail sales is actually being consumed reasonably in real-time? That might not be I think but --? Jim Sheehan : Yes. I think I talked about a little bit earlier, the early read, probably by a lot of companies was that it was a stock up or pantry loading, but what we have seen is, again, not only the new households, but this strong repeat rates, the velocities are good. And then, even the new buyers there's a good new buyer repeat. And so, are there some brands or some categories perhaps, but I think our big brands, when you think about SKIPPY, you think about SPAM, when you think about Hormel chili, those items seem to be really clearing not only the retailer, but obviously the household as well. And so, what does that mean for later in the year? I don't know that it's as much about the brands and how much they have in the pantry as much as what happens with that consumer behavior, as food service perhaps starts to open up a little bit more, and is there a pent-up demand as consumers maybe don't want to -- don't want to be eating at home and they want to migrate to food service operations. That's the uncertainty that we're thinking about and talking about. But as far as the grocery products business and the lift in sales and the repeats, we've been really, really pleased. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Just starting with a follow up to Ken's question, I understand your thinking on just capital strategy and the debt. But can you give us a sense of how actively you might be pursuing things like M&A? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean from our activity level and how active we are. I mean, nothing has changed. I think the big change is what's happening in the marketplace is just a lot of organizations have really had to hit the pause button. So I think we continue to look at a number of different processes evaluate opportunities. But clearly the market itself is not as active as it was. So, when it's really hard to read when that will pick up. But I mean, we're continuing a very active process that we always have. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. And just on the export outlook, can you give us a sense of what your expectations are there and with any political risks, do you think there is a pork going to China, especially if there were to be any instances of shortages here in the U.S.? Jim Snee : Well, the USDA is expecting exports to be greater than 10% is what their outlook is. As we've had an interruption in operations, I think it's added some concern about whether we'll be able to meet that that level or not. But I think there's still a demand for pork from the United States to be exported ops. Political activity, I guess I'll pass on. Jim Sheehan : Yes. That's really hard to tell. I mean, obviously, we've seen a lot in the technology space, but people need to eat. So that's really kind of hard. That's kind of hard to predict. Operator : We will take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I've tried to do a better job of forecasting your grocery division and looking at our retail tracking data, you indicated sales up 48% just for that division alone. And Jim say, I know you said that retail tracking is doing really well. But is there any reason you don't want to give us exactly what the IRI data is telling you it is? It would be very helpful to us as we try to correlate your shipments to your to the retail tracking so that we don't overestimate it. Because you kind of touch around on it, but was there any reason you don't want to guess like this, the total number for that grocery division to grow, it's the easiest thing for us to forecast, may be sounds like? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, Rob, I guess, we're not. We don't have anything that we don't want to tell you about any of our businesses. I mean, I guess our position is -- all of our grocery products, data, meat products, data, or retail data in general is really strong. So maybe we can help you do a better job of predicting, it might be worthwhile in your follow up call with me -- send to me, we get into a little more detail just so. So we understand, and make sure we're talking the same way. But, like I said, from a broader sense, our retail business has been really strong across the board. Robert Moskow : Well, maybe I'll follow up this way. You said that your retail shipments are up 20%, is that consistent with your hierarchy data that 20% because our data would indicate something more than that? Jim Sheehan : We've got obviously some unmeasured channels in there. And I think again, it would be better -- probably better if you guys do a nascent kind of walkthrough, maybe channel by channel just so you get to a better number. Robert Moskow : Okay. My follow up actually is on the Austin facility. I thought actually that your facility would get some of the excess live hogs from other facilities nearby that are closed entirely? And would actually have pretty strong support margins as a result is that just kind of making too many assumptions or it's not possible to get extra volume from other plants combined? Jim Sheehan : Well, the facility really had few interruptions during the quarter, we harvest at all of our contracted hogs. So our first obligation are to the producers that we have long-term contracts with and long-term relationships with. So, we have harvested on Saturday we take these decisions about when we operate the plants as to when it's best financially to operate the plants. There were periods of time when for instance the demand in food service was so far down and there was no reason at all that you would extend your processing capacity. So we've managed the plant at a very reasonable thoughtful way that we are not going to shortcut our long-term relationships that we have with our producers to harvest another company's hogs. Operator : Your next question from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Pooran Sharma : Good morning everybody. This is actually Pooran on for Ben. Just wanted to follow M&A front. I know you guys have said your strategy kind of remain constant but on the food service and the deli front and these have clearly been strong driving growth for the company. Are you seeing any changes in valuations or greater willingness to sell in the marketplace, given the sharp drop in demand that we've seen? Jim Snee : Are you talking about M&A opportunities? Pooran Sharma : Correct? Yes. Jim Sheehan : I said a little while ago, I mean, I think there's almost been a pause in that activity. And so it's really hard to make a statement around valuations just because we haven't really seen the activity, the e-valuation process that we're going through, is active and consistent, but really wouldn't be in a position to make a comment on valuations as of yet. Pooran Sharma : Okay. That's fair. I just wanted to get your take on the performance in the international business, which was up quite strong. Could you just dive into that a little bit more and just help us think about that business in the next couple of quarters and maybe just the important moving pieces. Jim Snee : Yes. So I think as soon as we look out, I mean, we expect the demand for SPAM on a global basis to remain very strong. We also expect export demand for SKIPPY to be strong. We expect China to continue to improve, especially in the food service space. In China, the retail business really remained strong, with SPAM and SKIPPY and our refrigerated products both in store and ecommerce. So as we look forward that probably the biggest difference is that continual build of the China food service business which we expect to continue to improve as a march from their lockdown. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Ben Theurer : Actually wanted to follow-up a little bit on retail and what we've been talking in the past, you have more medium long term targets, new products innovation and to actually get basically a contribution from sales about 15% from innovative products. So what did you understand within the more recent dynamic within the retail channels? Could you share a little more detail on repeat rate purchases amongst like cards very well established, long lasting brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel chili, versus than the more newer brands or the innovated ones and the innovation just to understand how the velocity and the different subcategories is running, that would be great. Jim Snee : Yes. Ben, I want to start with the really the first part around innovation. And what's been really impressive across our organization even though the fleet moved to working virtually, our innovation hasn't slowed down at all. Our team's done an amazing job being able to work virtually on the innovation process. In fact, I know it's a number that we usually report at the end of the year. But of course, we track it throughout the year. And we met our 15% innovation goal. And so the results that we're seeing are really, really positive and there's just lots of great innovation work being done not only in terms of the R&D process, but being able to get them out in the marketplace, having virtual products showcases virtual cuttings and innovations across the entire pipeline. So whether it's SKIPPY pepperoni, Natural Choice, happy little plants, I mean, you name it, the innovation work continues. In terms of repeat rates, again, SPAM has one of the highest new buyer repeats. And so a brand that's over 80 years old, as they said, it's probably more relevant today than it's ever been. The repeat rates for items like Herdez, Black Label Bacon, I mean, all really, really strong. So, again, kind of piggybacking on my earlier comments, just very pleased with the retail performance new buyers from new buyer repeat, in store et cetera. There's just a lot to feel really good about in there in the retail business. Ben Theurer : Okay, perfect. And then, my follow up question. I mean, very clear on the 20 million now and the $60 million to $80 million for the remainder of the year. And you said, it's most of it is actually non-recurring, but I could imagine that part of it must be to a certain degree recurring in terms of some of the PPE and some of maybe the social distancing, I don't know you have to bear in mind. So if you could share a little bit more medium term outlook, would you think potential costs 30 could be once things are back to a more normal level, but maybe not perfectly normal? Jim Snee : Right. I mean, I think the things will that won't be reoccurring over the long-term, right? So we have team member bonuses that aren't built into those numbers. I mean, over the long-term, we don't expect those to be recurring. We're suffering from some lower tonnage and plants. Right now, over the long term, we expect that business -- those businesses to rebound and so we won't have that part. But we aren't going to have, PPE costs. So, whether it's mask, face shield, putting up dividers in the plants to make sure that that there's that distance, that separation. And those things are going to be there on a permanent basis. And so, where we're at right now evaluating which of those costs are temporary and which are more permanent, that will need to be passed along. And so, this is, again, our number one priority has been to keep team members safe at all costs. As Jim said, we weren't negotiating prices. We're negotiating supply. And then, the second was to keep the product on the shelf, which we've done in an amazing way. And then really our third objective as we go forward is really understand what costs are permanent, what costs are temporary? So this is all a work in process. Jim Sheehan : Jim, the one thing that I would point out is that many of these costs are industry costs, and will be every participant in the market are going to have these types of costs. The other thing is, we have to have time to build efficiency around some of these things. We've been reacting to putting the fires out, let's say, and as we have more time to look at line speed and social distancing, and the costs around those we'll be able to build efficiencies into the model. So what we're trying to do is to analyze these expenses that were just short-term expenses and to some degree to have to be absorbed, And then building a more efficient process with the way that we will have to operate in the future, and we will certainly be able to do that. But right now, we're just reacting to the changes will get better as we go through. Operator : We'll take our last question from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney : I was wondering if it's possible to quantify the effective profit mix, both within grocery products and within refrigerated foods. But it strikes me, I say if it's possible, because I know what you're making on a given product is all over the place, when cups are all over the place. But if he could imagine 2019, or more normal sourcing environment, I'm trying to understand and how structurally, the products that declined compared to the products they grew in terms of the structural kind of profit you'd expect to make in a normal sourcing environment, for the purposes of just looking at where the business comes out maybe a little bit -- getting a little bit more detail on that. I think Ken Zaslow asked you a similar question about that structural profitability earlier. Thanks very much. Jim Snee : Jonathan, there's some things to consider. I mean, obviously, grocery products has a really nice margin structure. The growth that we saw in SPAM, drives a lot on that. The other part that makes it really difficult, as Jim talked about is this volatility that you see within the quarter. And so we're still dealing through that and to get to a normalized number is difficult. The food service piece, again, different parts of food service. We've got some, you know, higher margin, precooked, pre-sliced, pre-marinated, you'll also have elements of that are -- going to be commodity in terms of ribs that are going to barbecue businesses. So, the thing to remember is I mean, well, as Jim said, we'll be fulfill the efficiencies and processes, but we'll also make sure that pricing is adjusted over the long-term. And there's really two components to consider. And we talked about the markets. We've already taken pricing on certain products such as bacon that's moved very in a very volatile way. Some products are more CPG like and we're monitoring those markets. And then, as the conversation we just had around supply chain costs, so we have to understand what your temporary, what your permanent, which are going to have to be passed along over the long-term. So, it is a difficult question and there's a lot of moving parts. That will continue to be working on over the months ahead. Jim Sheehan : So I think one way to look at it is as we move especially around food service into a more user convenient products, that's going to add value both to Hormel and to our operators. And that clearly seems to be a shift that's going to happen in the food service industry where there'll be less desire to touch those products. And when you think about our Bacon 1 and some of the other products we offer, those have nice margins on our side, and offer the opportunity for the operator to expand their margins to so we think that's a win-win opportunity. Operator : At this time, for any closing or additional remarks? Jim Snee : Well, thank you. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, I want to thank you for listening in today and being patient with our technical difficulties. Now this is an uncommon company with an incredible 129-year history. We have weathered many storms during those 129 years and we will weather this storm because we were made for this. I wish all of you an enjoyable Memorial Day weekend and please stay safe and healthy. Operator : This concludes today's call thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning everyone. Before we get into the business results of the third quarter, I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all of our dedicated plant professionals for showing up every day in our manufacturing facilities. They are the true heroes of our company in this crisis. It has been remarkable to see our team work together to provide safe, high quality food for millions of consumers impacted by the pandemic. I'm very proud of how all our team members rose to the challenge with a sense of responsibility, purpose, and pride.  From the very beginning of this pandemic, we committed to putting the safety of our team members first. I believe this safety-first commitment is what has set us apart during the pandemic. Since we last updated you in May, our COVID leadership team including operations, quality control, communications, legal, R&D, and human resources have continued to enhance and refine our safety practices. These include expanded automated temperature screenings, the addition of more staggered production shifts, and increased training on COVID-19 best practices. Our awareness campaign, Keep COVID Out is also helping prevent the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work and keep the virus out of our production facilities by outlining the various preventative measures we can all practice in order to stay safe.  We partnered with the CDC to review our efforts related to COVID-19 and how we have implemented guidance from the CDC and OSHA at one of our production facilities. Their review included a multiple day visit to the facility, along with surveying employees regarding their knowledge, attitude, and practices on COVID-19. I am pleased with their findings, namely that we had implemented virtually all recommended controls to prevent transmission of COVID-19. The survey of our diverse team found that more than 90% of our employees have a comprehensive understanding of prevention techniques and what to do if they get sick with the virus. In addition, over 98% of our team members surveyed reported that they wore a facial covering when out in public. These actions are making a difference to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.  You have heard me say Hormel Foods is an uncommon company, and that has never been more true than it is today. Our inclusion and diversity guiding coalition is an example of a group that has demonstrated our uncommon culture during this difficult time. As we witnessed the social unrest this summer, we knew we needed to take action as a company. Hormel\u2019s Inspired Giving platform is our response to this important cause. As a company that is inclusive in all that we do, we decided to let our team members choose how we should launch our new Inspired Giving program, and I am incredibly proud of the partnerships they selected. This team selected three organizations to make donations to; minorities in agriculture, natural resources, and related sciences, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and UNCF. These organizations are all helping change the world by tackling equality and education. Today, we separately announced a milestone effort in our commitment to education. We believe education has the power to change the world and access to educational opportunities can lift up people and communities. Equality and education can be a game changer, and we have decided to take on that challenge. Through a new program called Inspired Pathways, we are going to make the dream of a college education available to the children of our team members. When you think about how a college education can change a life and start a ripple effect, that will be felt for generations that's the change maker Hormel Foods wants to be. We will be finalizing the details over the next several months but beginning in the fall of 2021, Hormel Foods will provide for every graduating senior who is the child of one of our employees the opportunity to attend community college on us. This program is one of a kind and truly uncommon. I'm excited to see the difference these two new programs Inspired Giving and Inspired Pathways will make in our communities.  Turning to our business results this quarter, we delivered record third quarter net sales as three of our four segments delivered sales growth. This achievement is a testament to the strength of our brands, the dedication of our supply chain teams, and the balance across our business. For the quarter, volume increased 4% and organic volume increased 3%, sales increased 4%, and organic sales increased 2%. Before I get into the segment results, I would like to provide some channel perspectives as each of our domestic segments have exposure to the retail and food service channels. Total retail sales increased 19% during the quarter with strength from virtually all of our brands. In many categories, we were able to once again capture market share by outperforming our competitors. According to IRI, during the quarter we grew share in approximately 60% of the categories where we are the number one or number two brand. We also saw tremendous growth in e-commerce, including direct to customer and online grocery pickup and delivery. During the quarter, our tracked purchases through IRI were up over 100%, and our brands continue to outpace category growth and capture market share in many categories. The investments we have made into our e-commerce capabilities are having a very positive impact on our performance in this important channel.  Throughout the pandemic, we have brought millions of new households into our brands using a combination of IRI data, on shelf availability data, custom research and data science. We are gaining deep insights into the number of new consumers coming into our retail brands along with their demographics, behaviors, and assessment of whether they will stay in our brand franchises over the long term. While we know it's unreasonable to retain 100% of the new consumers as brand stewards, it is our responsibility to keep as many consumers in our brands as possible. While we are seeing a rebound in our food service business as restaurants reopen and pipelines refill, total sales in our food service channel declined 19% compared to last year. Though many patrons are returning to their favorite establishments, it is clear the industry will be in recovery mode for quite some time.  We are proud to have built strong relationships in this industry and we are among the first to offer our assistance to those operators who needed our help to navigate their new reality. We hold deep competitive advantages in the food service industry, including our relationships with operators and distributors that spanned decades and large direct sales force and a balanced product portfolio. We also have the advantage of being able to quickly turn insights from our sales force who are on the front lines in kitchens each day, and to solutions that solve for the challenges and concerns of operators. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our pre-strategy with pre-marinated, precooked, pre-sliced, and fully prepared product offerings. Brands like Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Austin Blues, Caf\u00e9 H, Natural Choice, Burke, Jennie-O, Fontanini, and the recently acquired Sadler's brand have created solutions for operators in the areas of convenience, safety, versatility, and flavor. For years, many operators have slowly shifted their purchases to these types of products, and we believe the COVID-19 pandemic will accelerate the conversion. I'm confident our portfolio is well positioned to adapt and grow as the industry recovers. It is also important to note that this isn't the first time our food service business has had to emerge from an economic downturn. During the recession in 2008 and 2009, our direct sales force expanded their reach to the emerging channels of lodging, healthcare and colleges and universities. This intentional pivot provided significant growth for the next decade. Today, we are leveraging many of those same strategies with an increased focus on the newest emerging segments. From a financial perspective, we delivered earnings per share of $0.37, which is flat to last year. Jim Sheehan will provide more details, but I do want to mention that our earnings fully reflect $40 million or almost $0.06 per share, an increased supply chain costs related to COVID-19. Looking at the segments, grocery products volume increased 6% and sales increased 7%. Similar to the second quarter, we saw exceptional growth from nearly every brand, especially brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Herdez, Hormel Compleats, and Dinty Moore. Earnings for grocery products increased 36% driven by strong volumes and improved margins due to favorable product mix. It is clear that brands still matter and never have consumers relied on established and trusted brands to feed their families like they have during these times. Many brands within the grocery products portfolio have not only seen extraordinary growth, but they have outpaced the competition. Continuing to invest in these core brands is one of our highest priorities and responsibilities.  One brand which has seen a resurgence of demand is SKIPPY. While the entire peanut butter category has seen growth as kids stay at home, the SKIPPY brand has thrived and outpaced the competition. We've also launched numerous new innovative products which are seeing early success. SKIPPY Squeeze, SKIPPY No Sugar Added, and SKIPPY Peanut Butter Blended with Plant Protein, each deliver a unique consumer proposition and are helping extend and grow this iconic brand. We were pleased that our SKIPPY's Squeeze Pouch recently won an award from Food Network magazine for Smartest New Packaging for a long time favorite.  International volume decreased 5%, sales increase 2%, and segment profit increased 26%. Results from our China business were very positive during the quarter, primarily due to higher retail sales for SPAM and SKIPPY, but also from other refrigerated products in the country. We saw continued improvement in our food service business as restaurants reopened. Similar to the past few quarters, the team in China is working through higher pork prices and are taking the necessary pricing actions to offset cost increases. Worldwide demand for SKIPPY peanut butter and SPAM luncheon meat was strong, which drove higher exports and growth from our affiliated businesses in the Philippines, South Korea, and Europe. The dynamics we are seeing in the United States are playing out across the globe in similar ways. We did see a sharp decline in our fresh pork exports as variety meat supplies were limited because of in-plant labor shortages stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Jennie-O Turkey Store volumes declined 9% and sales declined 4%. We saw very strong retail sales led by our Jennie-O lean ground turkey. This growth is a continuation of the progress we've made in regaining distribution prior to the pandemic and we plan to advertise against the Jennie-O brand in key markets later this year.  While we saw strong growth in our retail business, it was not able to offset declines in our food service commodity and whole-bird businesses. Segment profit decreased 67% driven exclusively by the impact from three plant pauses and incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19 safety measures. This is an important distinction as it speaks to how the earnings strength in our retail business was able to offset the declines in our food service business. We were making excellent progress in many areas, but the cascading impact of three plant pauses throughout our vertically integrated supply chain had an outsized impact on profitability this quarter. As such, the overall earnings decline this quarter is not reflective of where I believe this business is going. I'm confident we are on the right path. Refrigerated foods volume increased 8% and organic volume increased 7%. Sales increased 5% and organic sales increase 2%. Retail and Deli demand was led by strong growth from products such as Applegate Natural and Organic Products, Hormel Black Label Bacon, and Columbus Grab and Go Charcuterie. Fresh pork sales also increased on strong demand for retail pork. One brand I want to highlight is Applegate. Consumers are discovering the Applegate brand at a rapid rate as families are looking for options to feed their kids while at home during the pandemic. Our offerings span multiple categories including chicken nuggets, hotdogs, burgers, and breakfast sausage. The growth we have seen from Applegate in the last few months is staggering and we are investing in the business in order to maintain momentum. The Applegate team delivered these impressive results even as they battled disruptions in their third party logistics system due to COVID-19 and I've had to work creatively to find additional capacity in their supply chain.  The Hormel Daily Solutions team has also seen impacts from COVID-19 as consumers shift purchases away from behind the glass meats and prepared offerings to prepackaged and pre-sliced options. During the third quarter, sales into the Deli increased 4% as strength in our Grab and Go offerings more than offset declines in our prepared foods and behind the glass businesses. We expect this trend to continue as our Hormel gatherings, party trays, and Columbus branded items provide differentiated at home experiences.  Another brand I'd like to highlight is our Hormel Gatherings Party Trays. When the pandemic started we saw a sharp decline in sales due to social distancing mandates. As always, our marketing team went to work to solve this problem. They quickly repositioned the brand from a focus on social gatherings among friends to a more family oriented brand message. Our food service business, which represents approximately 40% of refrigerated food sales, saw double-digit declines during the quarter. However, we are very confident that as the food service industry recovers, our product lines featuring pre-cooked, pre-sliced, and pre-marinated products will thrive as operators look to simplify preparation and reduce handling of products. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks on the food service industry it is important to remember that we have been through this before. The food service industry will reimagine itself and we are perfectly positioned to support them during this time.  This past quarter, we successfully integrated the Saddlers Smokehouse organization into refrigerated foods. We received a lot of positive feedback from the prior owners who credited our team for providing access to Hormel Foods resources and necessary support during the pandemic. Early indications are promising, especially seeing the ease at which Sadler\u2019s was able to pivot from food service to expanded retail distribution. I'm personally excited to see how our broader organization is able to leverage Sadler\u2019s unique product offerings to deliver innovative new products.  Earnings declined 11% due to lower food service sales, incremental supply chain costs, and losses on strategic hog hedge positions. Setting aside the offsetting channel dynamics within refrigerated foods, incremental COVID-19 costs and losses on strategic hog hedges were the primary reasons for their earnings decline. As we look forward for the total company we expect the fourth quarter to mirror many of the dynamics we experienced in the third quarter. We expect continued strength from our retail businesses as consumers engage with our brands at elevated rates. There remains a high level of uncertainty as to how quickly segments in the food service industry such as casual dining, lodging, and schools will reopen. Therefore, we expect our food service business will show declines in the fourth quarter.  As I said in my opening comments, the members of our supply chain team are heroes in the pandemic. Their tireless dedication has allowed us to meet the high level of demand we are seeing across our business. In many businesses, we are producing more products than we ever have to meet the increased demand. Examples include plants where we've not had positive COVID-19 cases or plants where we had excess capacity to meet the surge in demand. In other businesses, factors such as limited labor availability and short-term inefficiencies due to COVID-19 safety measures are limiting our ability to meet the high levels of demand we are seeing. Further, the third quarter is historically when we build inventories to meet the seasonally high demand in the fourth quarter. However, the record sales in our third quarter has led to abnormally low levels of inventory, which further limits our ability to meet demand in key categories. Jim Sheehan will provide more details regarding our inventory levels. Without compromising employee safety, our supply chain team is working to find solutions to increase production through continuous improvement, further internal production capacity, and by working with our trusted coal manufacturing partners. Consistent with the second quarter, we are incurring incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19. During the second quarter, our costs increase by approximately $20 million and in the third quarter our incremental cost were approximately $40 million. These were primarily related to team member bonuses, enhanced safety measures, and lower production volumes. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur another $20 million to $40 million of incremental costs. In total, we expect our COVID-19 related cost to be between $80 million and $100 million this fiscal year.  In closing, I am confident we have the right strategy, sound business fundamentals, best in class management, and the financial strength to thrive and grow in this dynamic marketplace. We are well-equipped to weather this storm and will be stronger because of it. At this time I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position, and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. You heard Jim give a few examples of how uncommon Hormel Foods is, I'd like to share another example. Early in the pandemic, the Project Orion team made the commitment to push forward with the go lines of the financial system. In spite of the difficult circumstances, the team was able to fully convert the financial systems to the cloud, train the finance team, and deliver our third quarter financials on time. By doing so, the Orion team kept us on track to achieve the benefits of this best in class financial system. These benefits include improved analytics, robotic process automation, and real time financial data. Further implementation of the supply chain remains on track and will take place later in 2020 and 2021.  Net sales for the third quarter increased 4% to $2.4 billion, which was a record. Higher sales were driven by strong value added retail sales across all segments. Segment profit declined 3% compared to the prior year as the business absorbed incremental COVID-19 related investments of $40 million and generated lower earnings from the food service businesses. Net earnings were $203 million up 2%, earnings per share of $0.37 was flat to last year. SG&A excluding advertising modestly increased to 6.6% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. Higher employee related expenses were mostly offset by reduced travel expenses. Advertising investment for the third quarter were $24 million.  Net and allocated expenses declined $5 million for the quarter due to improved return on investments. Operating margins were 10.5% compared to 11.2% last year. Margins were impacted by additional investments into the safety of our plant professionals, employee bonuses, higher operating costs, and the impact of operating pauses [ph] at Jennie-O Turkey Store. The effective tax rate was 21.6%, compared to 23.6% last year. Even in these uncertain times the company continued to generate strong and stable cash flows. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the quarter increased 59% and 72% respectively. Cash flow benefited from lower levels of inventory. The third quarter is usually spent building inventory in anticipation of higher seasonal demand in the fourth quarter. As Jim mentioned, due to the significant demand for our products in the third quarter and limiting factors on production of key brands, inventory levels were unseasonably low as we began the fourth quarter. To provide context, the current finished goods inventory level is 24% lower than last year. The segments most impacted by lower levels of inventory are grocery products and refrigerated foods. In June, we issued $1 billion of 10 year bonds at the favorable interest rate of 1.8%. This cash will provide ample liquidity and allow the business to take advantage of strategic opportunities such as M&A.  We have $250 million of bonds maturing in April 2021. Our solid cash flow liquidity position and strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to fund our capital needs while continuing to invest in long-term growth opportunities. We paid our 368 consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 17th at an annual rate of $0.93 per share, and an 11% increase over 2019. This completes our 92nd consecutive year of dividends. The company did not repurchase shares during the quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter were 88 billion compared to 67 million last year. Large projects for the remainder of the year include the Burke Pizza Topping plant expansion, a new dry sausage facility, and Project Orion. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2020 is $350 million. Pork market was at 20 year lows during the quarter. This benefit was reduced by our mix of hog procurement contracts and losses on strategic hog hedges. These hedges were put in over a year ago to proactively manage the risk of higher prices due to African swine fever. Currently, pork industry production is operating at near capacity levels. According to the USDA, pork production is expected to be 3% higher for the year. We expect continued lower hog prices in the near-term. This environment supports plentiful supplies of pork, so plant disruptions would pose a risk to production volume and commodity prices.  The volatility in commodity values at the beginning of the third quarter negatively impacted margins. The USDA composite cut out peaked in early May at levels not seen since the PED virus outbreak in 2014. The cut-out fell nearly 50% by early July while trimmed beef trim and bellies exhibited similar volatility. Overall, pork trim was higher by 21% and beef trim was higher by 38% for the quarter. These costs have moderated in the fourth quarter. [Indiscernible] prices were 9% lower and have remained below last year. Worldwide demand for pork is strong. USDA is expecting exports to increase 19% for the year, driven by strong demand from China. We continue to monitor African swine fever in China, Southeast Asia, and Europe.  Fundamentals in the turkey industry remain mixed while placements continue to trend lower. Commodity markets rebounded, some in the third quarter while breast meat and thigh meat prices are significantly below last year. Overall prices are favorable to last year, helping to offset declines in other markets. Meat cost for the third quarter was higher. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Yes, good morning Jim and Jim, and first of all, congrats on the results and on all the initiatives you announced, especially one on education. I think this is a very good way of supporting your workers. Now, I wanted to dig a little bit into what you said about the inventory levels and the decline here, and what it means for the fourth quarter. So, thanks for sharing a little bit of detail already in the prepared remarks on the impact where it mainly is within grocery and refrigerated foods. Now, how do you think this is going to impact your ability to supply the demand into the fourth quarter which usually obviously has an impact and an uptick in sales, so just to understand a little bit what might be prohibited in terms of sales and what might be the impact if demand remains as strong, particularly retail channels, as we've seen? That would be my one question. Thank you very much. Jim Snee : Yeah, Ben thanks for the comments. We sincerely appreciate them. With regards to the business question around inventory levels, I mean really as we've said multiple times in the comments, the supply chain team since the start of this pandemic has done heroic work to meet the increased demand. And really what we're trying to convey here is as we think about what happened in Q2 to Q3, as we had more -- we had the initial outbreaks and we had plant pauses and more significant disruptions to the supply chain, we did have inventory as a buffer and we're able to continue to fill orders as we were working our way through the initial stages. Over the course of those quarters, though, I mean what we have burned through that inventory. And so now as we head into the fourth quarter, I mean it's going to be very important paramount, if you will, that we keep our supply chain operational. And like I said, the team's done a great job but we can't afford any disruptions. And although we're not seeing the level of outbreaks of COVID cases and we are still having cases on occasion and those cases can have production impact. So, the team is doing a great job as you heard, keeping COVID out of our facilities, working with team members in the facilities to make sure they understand the importance, but But really it's the messaging that says, we were able to have inventory as a buffer. We really in some areas don't have that now and so making sure that our supply chain and our production efficiencies are where they need to be is going to be critical to meet the increased demand. And so, I mean, if you look at some of the demand that we have met, I mean significant increases in pepperoni, in bacon and in spam, some of our center store items. So, we've been able to meet that increased demand, but we just have to make sure that we keep that supply chain in our production facilities going. Benjamin Theurer : Okay, very clear. And then just the technical; one of the 40 million direct-indirect cost supply chain disruption and so on, can you break that out on a segment basis just to understand where the majority was impacting, is it I suppose, refrigerated foods, but also in Jennie-O, how much of an impact that you had there because of some of the plant pauses that you had? Jim Snee : Yeah, and a majority of them, a majority of those costs were in refrigerated foods and JOTS and obviously in our comments we were pretty specific to talk about that. That outsized impact if you will in JOTS so, that's probably the right way to think about it. Jim Sheehan : Ben what I would add to that is because JOTS is vertically integrated, the impact on JOTS not only is in the products they sell and the availability of that product and their production lines, it goes all the way to the growth side. Benjamin Theurer : Yeah, okay, great. I'll leave it here. Congrats again, thank you. Jim Snee : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions and also congrats on the nice quarter. So I guess I want to go back to Jennie-O, so clearly profitability was challenged during the quarter. Are we now past the plant pauses or is that still an ongoing headwind? And just curious, just any thoughts in terms of how you see the profit recovery unfolding per year for JOTS? Jim Sheehan : Yeah, thanks for your comment. So, I mean we haven't had any plant pauses since the beginning of the third quarter, and I mean, we continue to bring labor into the plants. I mean, that's a key ingredient in making sure that we can run the harvest facilities. Of those three plant pauses that we had in Jennie-O Turkey Store and the costs associated, and that had a big impact. Jim just mentioned that it goes all the way back in the vertical supply chain. And, when we can't harvest herbs, we have higher like production costs or higher feed, and then other issues. So, on the supply chain side; big, big impact. But as we think about the dynamics of the business, my comment about why I feel good about it is, we saw the benefits of the distribution that we had regained pre-COVID-19. Now, we understand the impact of consumers going and eating at home more. But obviously, we had to be on a shelf for them to be able to find us. So the distribution gains that we had, we benefited from. We did have a negative impact on our food service business, especially early in the third quarter. You know, like our Hormel Food service business, we've seen some recovery. The Jennie-O Turkey Store food service business is a little more skewed to schools and they have the impact of K through 12 and we're trying to understand how that plays out this semester. So, I mean all in all, it really is COVID related costs that negatively impacted the business. We feel good about the retail side, we\u2019ve got to have recovery in the food service side, but everything that we put in place pre-COVID is playing out and that\u2019s why we are optimistic about the business heading into the future. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And I guess my one follow-up question, just on e-commerce, you guys had very positive commentary in terms of what you are seeing in e-commerce, both direct to consumer and the clicking collective of your consumers. From a brand perspective, where are you seeing the most strength right now and is anything surprising to you in terms of where you are seeing that strength? Jim Snee : Yeah, we are pleased, Rupesh, because we saw it across the Board. We saw it in a lot of our refrigerated products and also in our in our grocery items. So, it wasn't skewed to any one brand or product line. Really good balance across the portfolio. Rupesh Parikh : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. I've got one for Jim Snee and then one for Jim Sheehan. Jim Snee, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on what impact if any there's been from COVID on the product innovation cycle, you noted some of the call outs around new packaging for SKIPPY, you also had a pretty successful heritage of new product innovations that have driven incremental market share, is COVID and operational heavy lifting that you have pushing that innovation cycle out or you still making headway on that front? Jim Snee : Yeah, great, that's a great question Ben and I will tell you, we are making great headway on that front. I will reference the SKIPPY products that we're bringing into the marketplace and having some really good early success in multiple items. I just recently had an update in terms of the pipeline that is coming this fall. And I mean, it continues to be very strong. It's exciting. It's on trend. And our customers are looking for that innovation. So, I've been really, really impressed with the work that our innovation team, which of course, encompasses so many other functional areas, has been able to do remotely. The other thing that I would mention, and we talked about it, I know on our last call, I don't think we mentioned at this time, but we have continued to track at our 15% goal in regards to innovation. And so, in the midst of everything else that's going on, we haven't lost sight of the fact that innovation is part of our lifeblood and it's something that we need to continue to deliver to drive the company forward. And our team has just done an amazing job responding. Ben Bienvenu : That's great, okay, thanks. Jim Sheehan, you called out some of the color around your hedging strategy for hogs, makes perfect sense in light of what 2020 was supposed to look like in light of African swine fever and what that meant [ph] for hog prices. Would you expect with your current hedge book, would you expect continued headwinds from hog hedges in the fourth quarter in light of hog prices still being down pretty materially? Jim Sheehan : Yeah, good morning Ben. But as I said, the hogs are -- hit a 20-year low during the quarter and obviously our hedge positions where we thought were favorable, but any time you take hedge position, you're really mitigating your risk and not trying to time it, that's our strategy. We look at that purchasing hogs on a balanced model that has some on the open market, some on the Western Corn Belt, some on the composite value and utilizing hedges. So the hedges will be a headwind as we expect hog prices to be continued to be down. You know, production has backed up a bit during the time period that there has been some pauses in production. But again, it's a balanced model and as we've looked at our hog costs, our hog costs were still down 20% compared to the prior year. So it takes an approach that is viewing both the future and the current circumstances. Ben Bienvenu : Understood, okay, great, thanks. Best of luck. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Can you give a little bit more color on the food service, that channel splits you gave us really helpful, maybe just some of how that progressed over the course of the quarter and what you've seen since in terms of just the momentum or volatility around them? Jim Snee : Sure, early -- late second quarter, early third quarter I mean significant decline that we saw in our food service business. And early in the third quarter we started to see recovery. The business was on a very nice trend, upward trend and then as we started to see more COVID outbreaks around the country, what happened and it actually was kind of nice to see, is we saw the business or the recovery kind of plateau. And so at the outset what we saw was that initial significant decline in the business and what we saw this time with some of the outbreaks was that the business maintains a level it was at, it just plateaued. So it didn't continue its recovery. And now, we are starting to see a bit more recovery as different states do get it under control. But I mean the fact is that it's still significantly behind a year ago. For us, it is all about what does food service look like in the future, how does the industry reimagine itself, what are the emerging segments that will come from this. We do believe that food away from home is just such an ingrained behavior in our society that it is going to continue in some way, shape, or form but it probably will look different for the foreseeable future. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on M&A, I want to follow-up on your prepared remarks. You obviously mentioned it as something you consider your balance sheet as great for that and there's nothing new there. Maybe just was a little interested that it stayed in the prepared remarks or it's getting mentioned in an environment like this where it looks like -- it feels like it could be more difficult to get deals done. Is that not your sense or is there some better amount of activity there you're doing than it might seem with just the disruptions and some of the things, remotes and everything else? Jim Snee : Yeah, I think the key takeaway there is, again, you go back to the early stages. You had so many companies, so many people just really trying to figure out which way was up. And so the idea of having M&A activity was not at the top of anyone's list. It was about really running, running the day to day business. And I think that's moderated a little bit and people have figured out maybe a little bit of what a new normal might look like. There are more conversations, there is more interest, and I would tell you that the communication is picking up a little bit. So, from our perspective we believe that we're -- we continue to be in a really good spot with the strength of our balance sheet. Jim talked about our debt offering, when we did it, why we did it, but then also what that could mean for us down the road. So, we continue to value M&A as an important part of our growth strategy going forward. Michael Lavery : Alright, thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning guys. The grocery sales seems a little lighter than I would have expected. How much of that is reflecting in the demand side versus how much is it operational inability to get the product to the consumer or the retailer? And then in addition to that is when you're looking at your inventory levels and your higher ability to get to the retailer, what are the longer-term implications on shelf space and relationships in terms of shorting customers given the demand? Jim Snee : Sure, I'll answer both of those Ken and I'll -- Jim has any inventory follow-up, I'll let him do that. You know, as you think about grocery products, I mean, the core is right -- the SPAM, the SKIPPY, the Chili, the Dinty Moore and all of that business was very, very strong and able to meet the demand. Probably that gap you're describing and we had a little bit of this I believe in the second quarter is -- this offset by food away from home and contract manufacturing. So the food away from home exists in our MegaMex business and that, like our Hormel food service and our Jennie-O food service business was down. And then we also saw a decline in our contract manufacturing business. So as you think about that delta, those are probably the two pieces that would lead you to that underperformance comment. But I mean, from our perspective, our legacy, our core grocery products business was really, really strong. And even our MegaMex business was up. But we did have a negative impact from their food away from home business. On the inventory piece. I mean, your comment is well made that if over a long-term, you're not able to supply a customer there's going to be ramifications. And I mean, we're not in that position. I mean, we're able to meet and maintain our shelf space with our customers. And going back to my earlier comments, the whole comment around inventory is just that it's shifted, right. We don't have that as a buffer so we do need to make sure that the operations are running as efficiently as they can. So yeah, we're as you would expect and I'm sure you're hearing from others, we're in a constant dialogue with retailers in terms of making sure that where we're meeting their needs, they understand what our situation is and certainly we're not going to put any of our business or our shelf space at risk. Jim Sheehan : Ken the only thing that I would add to that is that as you think about the inventory decrease, the decreases don't all have the same impact. For instance, we know our food service business is down, so we have purposely decreased our food service inventory so that we could reallocate resources into the retail production. So the supply chain is doing that all of the time and we're trying to meet every need we can. So there are some -- there are some areas that are not going to have much of an impact because they're short, such as some of the areas of food service. Ken Zaslow : And my follow-up, just a clarification on the turkey business, is everything working now and we should be thinking more normal margins at this point relative to whatever the industry is, or is there still operational legacy issues, I just didn't understand the commentary? And I'll leave it there. Jim Snee : Well happy to clarify that. I mean, the plants are all up and running. I think from an industry perspective, I mean our margins, our business are always at the top of the industry. We do continue to have higher COVID related costs. And so, PPE, some of the labor issues that would lead to lower volumes, lower overhead recovery, I mean those are still there as we progress in the quarter. But I mean, the plants are still running. We haven't had any pauses since the beginning of the quarter. And so, the retail demand, especially in the lean ground turkey area really, really strong. The food service business is recovering, but still trailing last year. Jim, I don't know if you want to add anything. Jim Sheehan : Yeah, and as you -- again we are being vertically integrated. As you've held birds longer, they are heavier birds, they don't perform as well. We're starting to move through that inventory but that's why the impact on Jennie-O has a longer tail than in areas where we're not vertically integrated. Ken Zaslow : And did you clarify if the plants were running what the operating margins would have been and I really will leave it there, I'm sorry? Jim Snee : No, Ken I want to -- you can have that offline with Nathan and see if he can give you more clarification. Ken Zaslow : Great, thank you guys. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Palmer of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the question. In the refrigerated foods segment price mix was down pretty meaningfully. Just wanted to better understand to what extent this reflected a flow through of lower industry commodity prices whether mix such as the higher fresh pork sales at retail were a factor and then as we think about how the fourth quarter might play out, how pricing could proceed especially considering that it sounds like supply is a bit of a constraint right now and thus some pricing for at least pullback in promo could make some sense? Jim Sheehan : Tom, as you look at the sales of refrigerated foods, they certainly were impacted by lower commodity prices. They had volatility, but prices generally were lower. I mean, as you look at the at the various items, for instance, even bellies it\u2019s had volatility, but it ended closer to the below last year. It was below last year. So that certainly had an impact in the sales prices in refrigerated foods, less than a miss [ph]. Jim Snee : And as you think about the fourth quarter, I mean on the markets, I mean it feels like all of the supply plants are running at very solid levels and the supplies are going to be adequate going forward. So I would expect more of the levels that we're seeing right now. Thomas Palmer : Okay, thank you. And I guess just to follow-up on co-packers. So how do you see this margin overhang going away over time. Is it driven by over the next couple of quarters taking certain products in-house or is it more that as demand can -- the increased demand for product starts to ease essentially that is a co-packer issue solve itself? Thanks. Jim Sheehan : So Tom, just to just to clarify, I mean we have already a very well developed and trusted network of co-packers, co-manufacturers that support different areas of our business. I guess what we were saying is as we think about, the need to continue to meet increased demand and make sure that we have the right appropriate risk mitigation. We are finding ways to expand the capacity with some of those trusted coal packers. So it's really less about bringing it back in-house. It's more about finding those opportunities to expand the supply side of the business. Thomas Palmer : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just have a couple of quick ones, one on Q4, I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Jim Snee, you're saying that if your plants run well that you should be able to sustain the sales gains you saw in Q3, you don't have the inventory buffer, but your plants are running at higher capacity, am I understanding that correctly? Jim Snee : I guess what we're saying there, Heather, is I mean we know that there's going to be increased demand and continue to be increased demand and to meet that demand we have to have our plants run as efficiently and effectively as possible because we don't have that safety stock to draw. So I think we're saying the same thing. Heather Jones : Okay, perfect. And then the second thing is you've mentioned the impact from hog hedges that you have put in place last year, but then some lower cash hog prices so for the quarter, did I understand you correctly and I think this was Jim Sheehan comment, did I understand you correctly though, that net-net even of the hedge impact that hog costs were more favorable in Q3 than they were in Q3 of 2019? Jim Sheehan : That's correct Heather. Heather Jones : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Galbo, Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I guess just as we're thinking about food service out over the next couple of quarters, you guys have a large direct sales force, right that probably has more touch points with some of your restaurant customers, maybe in some of your competitors and I guess the question we're kind of grappling with at this point is, as the weather starts to turn, maybe people go or are forced to go back inside, outdoor dining isn't really as much of a possibility, just what are some of the high level conversations that your salespeople are having with customers at this point that you are willing to share with us? Jim Snee : Sure, I mean that's a great question, and that is certainly a risk to the next couple of quarters. But I think the other part that we've seen, Peter is so many restaurants have become so much more proficient at a takeout, right. I mean again, as this started takeout was not a big part of the food service operators MO. I mean, some did it better than others and clearly you had drive through, I get all that. But, some of that casual dining locations, they had it as an option but it wasn't a very well developed option. But I think it's fair to say that operationally from a packaging perspective, so many food service operators have become so much more better, so much more proficient with that. And then I go back to this idea of how does food service reimagine itself. And so, this idea that over all these years we've developed this behavior of food away from home and now that's just going to -- I guess that it went away for a period of time but to think that it's going to go away forever just seems to be a bit of a stretch, if you ask me. So I do think that food prepared away from home is going to continue to be on everyone's radar. And I think as more and more especially casual dining segments get comfortable with to go, take out, that's going to continue to be an opportunity. We also are seeing and working with operators on different grab and go options. So not just food that you bring back into your house, but as you think about where individuals would maybe want to go and sit and have a meal, they're not doing that. It is more of a grab and go. And so everything that we have in our portfolio that we described around all of our pre-options sets us up really well to take advantage of that as food service continues to reimagine itself. So in our direct sales force, as you mentioned, is going to play a critical role in making sure that we understand and that we're on the front end of this re-imagination. It's going to be really, really important for us. So, I mean, those are just some of the conversations we're having. But, I mean, it's still this is going to be a work in process, but we feel good about where we're at in the cycle. Peter Galbo : Okay, now that's helpful, thanks very much. And maybe just Jim Sheehan a quick one, just you're kind of a month into the quarter at this point, you still have a pretty wide range on the COVID costs for the fourth quarter, just what would drive you to the high end versus the low end of the 20 million to 40 million? Thanks very much, guys. Jim Sheehan : The issue that would create the highest cost would be a play or pause. The fact that, you know, we talked about this I think even last quarter, every day we're getting better at running our facilities under the current structures and the current cost matrix that we have. And we'll be -- we were better at the end of the quarter than we were at the beginning of the quarter. And the end of the fourth quarter we will be much better. So we continue to improve and we address these costs. But they are real costs and they are there. So we're building efficiencies. If there's a plant pause that would have the biggest risk of increasing our costs. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Hi, yes, thanks. Good morning everyone, appreciate letting me squeezing in. So my question is just taking -- wrapping it all up a lot of ground covered. The comments on the fiscal fourth quarter kind of mirrors the dynamics of the third quarter. I'm just trying to translate that into kind of operating performance a little bit and is that intended to reflect sales and year-on-year sales and year-on-year margin performance would look similar absent kind of a substantial change in the COVID kind of outlook or just help me think about kind of what that actually means as we think about sales margins in your business? Jim Sheehan : Yeah so, Adam, good morning. I guess I'll take it more from a sales perspective. And so when we say similar dynamics to Q3, I mean, we're thinking about continued strong retail demand both from grocery products, refrigerated foods, and JOTS. Still experiencing recovery in the food service businesses and just a reminder that they're a big part of refrigerated foods and JOTS. So, we have continued to work to do. Our international demand is strong across most geographies. We expect that to continue. As I said earlier, from a supply chain perspective, not having outbreaks but we continue to battle on the production front as we do have individual cases and that can create production challenges. We've talked about the safety stock as a buffer and the need to have a supply chain hitting on all cylinders. And so, that's when we say the dynamics are similar to Q3. I mean, that's how we're thinking about it from a demand and a supply perspective. So hopefully that's helpful to you. Adam Samuelson : It is and just last quick one, the $80 million to $100 million of COVID related costs that you're expecting to incur in fiscal 2020, do you have any rough idea of what that could look like in fiscal 2021, I imagine there's a portion of that of bonuses that you wouldn't necessarily plan on, on repeating? Jim Sheehan : Yeah, we don't have -- we don't have an estimate on that for 2021 yet. We're starting that whole process and we're trying to get a better read on those that are permanent or longer-term and those that were temporary. So, we don't have that today and as soon as we get more clarity on that we'll pass that along. Adam Samuelson : Okay, thank you. Operator : The last question today will come from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : What an honor to be the wrap up question. Believe or not it's all about inventory levels. So one point of clarification I guess, last quarter, I think what we learned is that maybe 20% of the grocery division is contract manufacturing, also some alternative channels that are not growing within grocery. So is it fair to say that that's the reason why your grocery division is not demonstrating the same level of growth that most of us see in Nielsen measured channels at retail, it's -- I'm having trouble figuring out whether retailers reduced inventory or not, it sounds like they really did in third quarter but really the difference between the Nielsen measured and what you're reporting here is really just the alternative channels? Jim Snee : I think that's right Rob. First I would say it's always an honor to back clean up, so we're honored. But you're right, I mean, we do have that delta in grocery products. That is that the food away from home that's in MegaMex and then the contract manufacturing that I know we talked about last quarter. And so that is the delta. From a retailer perspective, I mean, we haven't seen anything significantly different in terms of what they're doing with their inventory levels. Robert Moskow : Okay, got it. So it's not like we're going to have a big resale in the October quarter related to the fall season or anything like that, you will ship to consumption in the fall in the October quarter, is your expectation? Jim Snee : Yes, exactly. Robert Moskow : Okay, and then last question, on refrigerated, you said that your commodity costs are also down, you used to give us fresh pork profits in the past when it was kind of normalizing lower, so are fresh pork profits higher in this quarter versus year ago as a result of those higher costs being down? Jim Sheehan : They're actually relatively comparable. Robert Moskow : Comparable. Jim Sheehan : Yeah, they're comparable because obviously there's been so much volatility in the markets. I mean, it's just been wild, that ways we are as low as 89 and as high as 267. And the timing of when you're buying and winning when you're selling just could have a -- play havoc on that. So Rob, this fresh pork is probably the most -- this isn't the best quarter to measure profitability of fresh pork, but it was in the range. Robert Moskow : Okay, and when you're talking about fresh pork, you're talking about also including those hedges as well that were unfavorable in the quarter? Jim Snee : That\u2019s true. Robert Moskow : Alright, guys. Thank you very much. Jim Snee : Yup, thank you, Robert. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you for joining us on our call today and one of our cultural beliefs is results matter. And as you heard today, we delivered results. We delivered results in many areas. We delivered results in our business, we delivered results in keeping our team members safe, and once again, we delivered results as a great corporate citizen. To our team members listening in thank you for all you do. Stay safe. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Before we get into the business results of the fourth quarter, I want to say thank you to all of our supply chain and plant professionals. They continue to show up every day and their dedication is remarkable. They are the heroes in our company during this pandemic. We remain focused on keeping all our employees safe, supporting our communities through these difficult times and meeting the needs of our consumers, customers and operators with safe, high-quality food. With a dramatic increase of COVID-19 cases upon us, we are doubling down on our awareness campaign called KEEP COVID OUT! These various preventative measures are focused on stopping the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work and keeping the virus out of our production facilities. In addition to our virus mitigation efforts and safety initiatives, in August, we announced a milestone effort in our commitment to education. Our new program called, Inspired Pathways, will provide for every graduating senior who is the child of one of our employees, the opportunity to attend community college on us. This program is one of a kind and truly uncommon.  Our team is making excellent progress on the program and we are excited for the first class to begin in the fall of 2021. We know the application process is a major roadblock to college admission. For this reason, we are building out a network of mentors in our company to assist employees and their children through the college application process.  Hormel Foods is a change maker and we are excited for the impact this program will have for our families and our future Hormel Foods families for generations to come.  Fiscal 2020 was, by all measures, challenging. This year certainly tested our balanced business model. Coming into this year, we were confident we could deliver record sales, but never could we have imagined how it unfolded. All four operating segments contribute to the record as each grew sales for the full-year.  This is even more impressive when you consider all four segments have sales into the foodservice channel, which showed sharp declines due to the pandemic. An important component to our growth this year was innovation. I am pleased to say our team achieved our goal of having 15% of our sales coming from new products created in the last five years.  Even in the midst of the pandemic, our team developed, launched and grew new product sales. Key items contributing to this accomplishment are SKIPPY peanut butter squeeze packs, Hormel Cup N' Crisp pepperoni, Herdez Salsa Cremosas, Happy Little Plants, Plant-Based Pepperoni and Foodservice, and many other innovative items. Earnings per share for the full-year were $1.66, compared to $1.80 last year. This includes over $80 million in incremental supply chain costs, representing almost $0.12 per share. This is in addition to a $0.10 headwind from the divestiture of CytoSport in 2019. As you think back on 2020, our experienced team managed through a lot of rapid and unpredictable changes. We\u2019ve been through a lot in the last nine months and we have gained an understanding on how to appropriately operate in this environment while never sacrificing employee safety.  In March and April, we all witnessed the foodservice industry collapse. On-premise dining was shutdown completely and most establishments were not prepared or structured to handle a large influx of pickup and delivery orders. Simultaneously, grocery store shelves were emptied due to incredible consumer demand.  We saw raw material markets decline precipitously as demand dropped, only to see markets spike as some harvest facilities temporarily paused operations. We also put multiple production facilities on a voluntary pause to protect the health and well-being of our team members, while also dealing with our suppliers pausing their production. It seem like each week since the pandemic started, we had a different raw material ingredient or packaging component shortage to manage through. As we sit here today, we believe there is more stability across the industry because of the learnings from the last nine months, even as COVID-19 cases surge across the country.  In the foodservice industry, even though on-premise dining is being restricted again in many states, operators are better prepared to effectively manage pickup and delivery. Our supplier community is also more experienced and had to handle manufacturing facilities and limited labor situations. There are countless other examples of improved stability across the food supply chain, but the bottom line is we do not expect there to be the same level of chaos as there was nine months ago.  Looking at the fourth quarter, volume decreased 2% and organic volume decreased 3%. Sales decreased 3% and organic sales decreased 4%. Earnings per share was $0.43, down from $0.47 last year, only reflecting $0.03 per share in increased supply chain costs related to COVID-19. Turning to our segments. Grocery Products volume increased 1% and sales declined 1%. Low inventory levels and production limitations in certain categories such as can meat and chili, limited our ability to meet the unprecedented customer demand. In categories, such as nut butters, where we had adequate capacity and labor, sales grew double digits. Earnings for Grocery Products increased 1% as improved results in categories such as nut butters and microwave meals offset increased freight expense and lower earnings from our MegaMex foodservice business. International volume decreased 1%. Sales increased 8% and segment profit increased 55%. The strong sales and earnings performance was led by our retail and foodservice business in China. Products like SPAM and SKIPPY have shown exceptional growth, but we\u2019ve also seen growth from innovative new items such as our Hormel Beef Turkey.  This product was launched in e-commerce channel and is the most successful new product launch in Hormel China\u2019s history. We remain very positive about the long-term prospects of our China business. International demand for SKIPPY peanut butter and SPAM luncheon meat was very robust. Both our U.S. export business and our affiliated businesses in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe benefited from this consumer demand.  Jennie-O Turkey Store volume declined 2% and sales declined 6%. Growth in Jennie-O lean ground turkey and whole birds was exceptionally strong. We did experience declines in foodservice, which was disproportionately impacted by lower sales to K-12schools. Segment profit decreased 21%. Lower foodservice sales and increased supply chain expenses associated with COVID-19 were key drivers to the profit decline.  The plant pauses in the second quarter continued to impact performance within our vertically integrated supply chain. Refrigerated foods volume decreased 4% and organic volume decreased 5%. Sales decreased 5% and organic sales decreased 7%.  Brands such as Applegate, Hormel Black Label, Hormel Fully Cooked Entrees and Hormel Always Tender generated exceptional growth this quarter. Lower levels of inventory and production limitations on certain categories such as dry sausage and sliced meats limited our ability to meet the unprecedented customer demand.  Our foodservice business, which has historically represented approximately 40% of refrigerated food sales saw double-digit declines during the quarter. Earnings declined 17% due to lower foodservice sales and incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19. Looking forward, our solid performance this year amidst the uncertainty posed by the pandemic, along with our balanced business model gives us confidence we can perform well in many different economic scenarios.  To give you a sense for how we are thinking about the future, I\u2019d like to walk through three important drivers to our near-term and long-term performance; retail dynamics for our brands, our leadership position in the foodservice industry, and our supply chain performance.  In the retail channel, like most food companies, we have seen dramatic increases and measures such as sales, household penetration, buy rates and repeat rate for our retail products as consumers ate more meals at home.  Instead of reviewing all the metrics, I want to provide some inside into the underlying consumer dynamics we believe are important to understanding how Hormel Foods is positioned to outperform as the pandemic subsides.  Long before the pandemic started, we were witnessing a shift away from the traditional sit-down family dinner. Anyone who was kids has experienced this. Many activities, not enough time and dinner was whatever could be eaten between activities.  The pandemic brought the sit-down family dinner back. Meals previously eaten on the go have become family activities and early on were viewed as enjoyable and highly anticipated within the home.  Through our research, we recognize that consumers are enjoying the new ritual of eating at home, but when products that are convenient, versatile, and flavorful. We have a portfolio of brands that meet these consumer needs. These brands were growing before the pandemic and we believe they will have staying power as the pandemic subsides because they are uniquely positioned to meet the evolving needs of consumers.  Another important trend in retail is ecommerce. We continue to drive market share gains in our biggest and most important categories as consumers quickly gain acceptance of ordering food online. We continue to shift our investments towards this channel and are excited by the growth we see. Turning to the foodservice channel, we are committed to the future of foodservice. We are confident consumers will want the choice to purchase food prepared away from the home. As a leader in the foodservice industry, we are adjusting and investing in our capabilities.  We are shifting resources to faster-growing channels, investing in our direct sales force talent and continuing to support the foodservice distributor and operator community as they battle through this difficult time period.  We cannot overstate the importance of relationships in this industry and the long-term competitive advantage our direct sales force provides. When the foodservice industry returns to growth, we understand operators will be looking for products to simplify their operations, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item.  Products like Hormel Bacon 1, Hormel Fire Braised Meats, Sadler's Authentic Smoke Barbeque and Caf\u00e9 H globally inspired proteins are well-positioned to thrive in this market.  Finally, I want to address our supply chain. In many categories, we have purchased at very high levels relative to our historical performance. We have been able to steadily improve our throughput as we learn how to operate in a COVID-19 environment or supplement our internal production with trusted co-manufacturing partners. On our first quarter call, we talked about short-term supply chain risks including lower inventory levels, limited labor availability, and production inefficiencies that could impact our ability to meet the unprecedented demand.  This played out in certain categories in the fourth quarter. Production in categories like can meats, pepperoni and Chili was constrained due to labor shortages, but also because of COVID-related changes in our production lines.  Our supply chain team has done an excellent job solving for each individual issue and our production capacity is structurally higher as we move into 2021. We continue to focus on the health and safety of our employees which impacts our ability to adequately staff our facilities. Our COVID-19 leadership team including operations, quality control, communications, R&D and human resources are working tirelessly to keep our team informed on COVID-19 preventative measures.  We are much better at adjusting through rapid changes in staffing than we were when the pandemic started and we\u2019ll continue to keep the health and safety of our employees as the top priority. A benefit we have this coming year is additional capacity from the investments we\u2019ve made before the pandemic started.  Our work expansion in Nevada, Iowa will open in our first quarter and will give us additional capacity for pizza toppings. Throughout the pandemic, we have seen sustained demand as pizza continues to be a favorite amongst consumers and patrons. This new capacity will help us meet that demand. We will also be opening our new dry sausage production facility in Omaha, Nebraska during the first half of the year.  This facility will produce Columbus Charcuterie products, which is an important milestone in the trajectory of this leading deli brand. We also announced an additional investment for pepperoni capacity. This will give us the runway to continue growing our retail and foodservice business. As you consider the various factors influencing our business, and our favorable balance across the retail, foodservice, deli and international channels, we are optimistic about our ability to grow sales and earnings in fiscal 2021. While uncertainty exists, we do want to give you some basic insight into how we see the year playing out.  For our retail business, it will be hard to replicate 2020 from a sales, demand perspective. However, we do expect continued growth albeit at a slower rate. For foodservice, we expect a modest recovery in the industry, but likely not fast to 2019 levels. Today, foodservice operators are better equipped to drive growth even with fewer patrons physically in their restaurants or venues.  We expect modest growth in our deli business as retailers are more experienced in operating their deli business in a COVID environment. As a reminder, our deli business exhibits characteristics of both retail and food service.  Finally, our international business is poised to continue growing and barring any unforeseen geopolitical issues is expecting a strong performance next year.  Hormel Foods has the right strategy. Our business fundamentals are solid and we are on sound financial footing. I continue to be incredibly optimistic about our long-term performance, even as we navigate all the uncertainty COVID has brought. As a global branded food company, our balanced and diversified business model positions us to win across all of our key channels.  At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position, and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, a decrease of 3%. For 2020, the company generated record sales of $9.6 billion, a 1% increase. Our balanced model proved successful as all four segments grew sales for the year. Fourth quarter and full year segment profit declined 9% and 4% respectively. The business absorbed approximately $81 billion in incremental COVID-related expenses during the year with $20 million impacting the fourth quarter. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.43 compared to $0.47 last year. Our fourth quarter results reflect approximately $0.03 an incremental COVID-related expenses and $0.01 in losses on strategic cost positions.  Full year earnings per share decreased 8% to $1.66. On an adjusted basis earnings per share declined 2%. CytoSport contributed $0.10 earnings per share in 2019, including the gain on sales.  SG&A, excluding advertising any expense reductions from the sale of CytoSport 2019 was 6.6% of sales compared to 6.5% last year. Advertising investments for the year were $124 million, compared to $131 million last year. Planned to increase advertising in 2021 to support many of our leading brands. Jennie-O will be the first turkey company to have a float in the 94 year of history of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Unallocated expenses returned to more normal levels in the year, compared to the prior year, which included the favorable impact of the sale of CytoSport and a legal settlement. Full year operating margins were 11.5%, compared to 12.6% last year. Decline was driven by the COVID-19-related expenses and the impact from lower foodservice rates.  The effect of tax rate was 18.5% compared to 19.1% last year. We again executed our disciplined financial strategy despite disruption caused by the pandemic. 2020 through operating cash flow, paid record dividends, invested in capital to grow our value-added businesses and acquired Sadler\u2019s.  We also secured $1 billion of debt to provide liquidity at a wealth of business to take advantage of strategic opportunities. The company remains in a position of strength heading into 2021. For the year, the business generated cash from operations of $1.1 billion, an increase of 22%. Cash flow benefited from lower working capital. Finished goods inventory began the third quarter and at seasonably low levels. Strong demand for our retail items continued into the fourth quarter. Retail business and grocery products and refrigerated foods were most negatively impacted by this dynamic during the course. We are seeing a gradual improvement in inventory levels. Presence in operations, labor availability, internal capital expansions, and increased use of strategic manufacturing partners give us confidence in the ability to expand supply in 2021. Paid our 369th consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 16 and announced a 5% increase for 2021, marking the 55th consecutive year we have increased the dividend. The new annual rate for 2021 will be $0.98 per share.  During 2020, the company repurchased 300,000 shares for $12 million. Capital expenditures in 2020 were $368 million, compared to $294 million last year. Recently completed an expansion at the first pizza toppings plant and nearing the completion of the new dry sausage facility in Nebraska. 2021, we will continue to prioritize investments to support the growth of the value-added businesses including a new expansion for pepperoni. The company\u2019s target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $350 million.  The hard market that has recovered from 20-year lows due to strong domestic and export demand. Less DA composite cut out showed similar strengths throughout the fourth quarter before moderating more recently.  USDA is projecting domestic production of ports to increase 1% in 2021. We expect hog prices to rebound significantly in 2021, continue to have ample access to hog\u2019s important raw materials through our balanced mix of hog and pork supply contracts. USDA composite cut out is expected to be modestly higher in 2021.  Although the outlook remains uncertain given the surge of cases happening now, it is our expectation that over the full year industry operating efficiencies and production levels will increase in 2021. Labor availability will continue to be a significant factor in the industry\u2019s ability to operate efficiently.  We expect much lower levels of commodity volatility compared to last year as supply stabilizes and demand exhibits less dramatic changes within the year. Strength of our brands and balanced approach to procurement will be key in managing through this volatility. Pork trim markets are expected to decline in 2021, but the value is highly dependent on the pork industry\u2019s operating level. We anticipate that deli prices will increase from the current levels. This is based on moderate foodservice growth.  Fundamentals in the turkey industry remain mostly unchanged. The benefit of favorable whole-bird prices, lower pork placements, and reduced cold storage levels are being offset by lower breast and thigh meat markets due to lower demand. We anticipate lower commodity prices of turkey in 2021 as sustained recovery in the foodservice industry would likely fed up the turkey markets.  Meat cost is expected to be higher. Managed feed cost through a combination of spot buy, derivatives, and adjusting feed formulas. We expect the COVID-19-related higher cost structure to continue through the first half. We expect the majority of the COVID cost to subside as the pandemic comes under control.  Although 2020 was a challenging year, it is important to revisit the accomplishments related to long-term growth and stability. We maintain one of the strongest balance sheets across the Fortune-500 companies, grew operating cash flow in excess of 20% and issued bonds that were well received by the debt investors.  We use this capital to gain market share in ecommerce and retail, support our leading brands through advertising and marketing, achieved our 15% innovation goal, invest in value-added capacity, expand our authentic foodservice portfolio with the Sadler\u2019s acquisition, and transform and modernize our company through Project Orion and One Supply Chain initiatives.  All of these actions will help us attain long-term growth goals while continuing our outstanding track record of returning cash to shareholders. In one of the most difficult years in our 130-year history, we have shown our continued commitment to our employees, our communities, and our shareholders.  At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Hey, Adam. Good morning. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So, I guess, Jim, I\u2019m trying to just wrap my head around kind of how the different moving pieces in the outlook and there is a lot of detail that you just gave on the cost side. But at a high level, there is an expectation of sales growth. On the cost side, raw material-wise, teams kind balance of puts and takes, a reduction in COVID-related expenses, potentially a step up in advertising and then just help on tax rate and just help me think about the other moving pieces as we\u2019re trying to think both bridge from sales to earnings per share, knowing you are not giving explicit guidance? Jim Snee : Thanks, Adam. I\u2019ll go ahead and start and I\u2019ll let Jim finish up some of the markets. But you are right, there obviously are a lot of moving pieces as we are thinking about 2021 just like they were in 2020. It does start with the demand side of the business. I think if you go back to our channel guidance around retail showing growth, albeit at a slower rate, foodservice having some modest recovery, deli business showing some growth and international maintaining its strength, I mean, that\u2019s the important first piece of the puzzle.  The second piece of the puzzle for us is the structurally higher capacity. And so, as we have tried to be very upfront about is, we didn\u2019t meet the demands of the business in the fourth quarter, but there is a lot of work happening behind the scenes. A lot of it was already planned. Some of it came to beat during the pandemic.  But it\u2019s work and execution that the team has been accomplishing over that time, that\u2019s why we feel good about where we are going to be from a capacity perspective heading into 2021 to meet the demands of the business.  From a COVID cost perspective, Jim talked about having the same cost structure in the first-half for the business. We need to all understand when does the vaccine come into play. When is it distributed? When can we see broad distribution. But I think the timing that we\u2019ve been hearing and have recently heard, is that first-half, second-half window seems to make sense. So, the demand side and the supply side for us, we feel really good about as we head into 2021. Jim, I\u2019ll let you maybe talk about some of the markets or any other financial information. Jim Sheehan : Sure. Good morning, Adam. Your comment about markets being mixed, I think, is a fair assessment of how we see 2020 \u2013 2021, excuse me. The main issue here is that you won\u2019t see the volatility that you saw, especially in the second and third quarter of 2020. Those periods we had a drastic decline in the foodservice demand and then you have plant shutdowns and it just created almost a violent level of volatility that we believe will be much more stable environment in 2021.  Part of the change in the input cost, for instance, bellies will be dependent on how quickly the foodservice business regain strength. Bellies track that foodservice demand very closely. So, overall, it is a bit of a mix. We see our hog costs somewhat similar to what they were in 2020, maybe slightly lower.  We will see what that happens, understanding that hog costs or the Western Corn Belt is forecasted to be much higher, but that\u2019s not really the basis of what we purchase hogs. And the other issue, you asked about was tax rate. We don\u2019t see any significant change in the tax rate in 2021. We believe the tax rate will be between 20% and 21.5% let\u2019s use that as the range as to where we expect to end up. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then, if I could just squeeze a question on Jennie-O, the business has had some challenges in recent years and kind of ex-COVID, I think, there was a thought that we might be turning the corner there. But now maybe a non-Thanksgiving or a different Thanksgiving maybe impacting inventories on the whole-bird side. Just help us think about the trajectory for the Jennie-O business specifically? Jim Snee : Sure, Adam. If you go back to Q4 of last year, we really had started to turn the corner in terms of our strategy that we were building out in regaining the lost distribution, especially for our lean ground business and we had a solid Q4, solid Q1, and quite frankly, Q2 was pretty good as well. I mean, as COVID came into play and dramatically impacted the supply side of the business for that product, also impacting just the supply chain, right, vertically integrated supply chain that had plant pauses, severe disruption, increased costs.  Now, as we made our way through that, we are still seeing impact in the supply chain. Anytime you back that supply chain up, you are going to have impacts for a while. The part that we remain optimistic about is the strategy of building out distribution, we still had success with lean ground turkey. The dramatic impact beyond supply chain has been Jennie-O foodservice business, like in the Hormel Foodservice business significant declines, they are just probably a little greater.  It\u2019s driven - they\u2019ve got a bigger presence in K-12 business, but just been dramatically impacted this year. So, I mean, you are right, it\u2019s been a mixed bag for Jennie-O over the last several years. But we feel good about where we were headed pre-COVID. We\u2019ve done all the right things during the COVID environment and feel like as we emerge from this pandemic, the fundamentals of the business, especially on the retail side are strong and then we are going to need to see the recovery on the foodservice side. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That\u2019s all really helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Jim Snee : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, just the first question, on the retail sales guide of still expecting growth despite at a slower rate. I guess, we are having a harder time understanding again in the first quarter where the comps have kind of continued to accelerate.  But as you just start getting to some of these tougher comps in the second quarter and back half of the year, understanding the capacity coming online, just help us understand your thinking around organically from a demand perspective, why that should continue to kind of grow in the second quarter and back half of the year? Jim Snee : Right. So, I mean, you hit on it on the first-half of the year. I think the second part of your commentary that there is a unknown of \u2013 even though we will have a vaccine in place, but how quickly are you going to see that recovery in foodservice and how quickly are consumers going to move back to historic behaviors. I think it\u2019s too early to tell. I mean, we do see a modest recovery in foodservice. But I don\u2019t think retail is just going to hit that cliff. I think the other part for us in the back half of the year is the fact that we did have some of these supply disruptions and we did meet all the demands of the business. So, from a comp perspective, we think there is going to be opportunities for us as well in the back half.  So, that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving our outlook for the retail business, the continued comps in really the first part of the year and then as we are going to be comping against some unmet demand in the back half of the year. Peter Galbo : Okay. Thank you. And then, Jim, maybe just on Jennie-O, your comments maybe in the cost section of your prepared remarks with higher grain and lower commodity prices and maybe if you could also comment on freight. Just how should we think about the margin trajectory in 2021, maybe not from an absolute level, but just versus historical, can we get back to 2019 type levels on the margin side? Just help me understand that? Thanks very much guys. Jim Sheehan : Sure, Peter. We obviously expect to continue to have some COVID cost in 2021, especially in the first half that will be a headwind to Jennie-O, excuse me, but one of the things that we can\u2019t understate is the impact to Jennie-O in their live production operation by the interruptions in production that they saw in 2021. How that backed up the birds, you are feeding birds longer.  You are processing birds at a heavier weight that underperform and I think that\u2019s a big benefit as we keep the operations running at a more consistent level when don\u2019t have these plant interruptions. That\u2019s going to be a significant benefit to their cost structure. So, yes, there will be headwinds with COVID costs. Grain cost could be higher, but we manage that grain cost through our hedges that we have.  We do support buying on grain. And we also could adjust the feed formula so that we are mixing the feed a little bit better to improve our feed cost. So, there is a lot of levers there that we can attain. In 2019, we had about a 9% margin on this business. We think that we can go back and achieve that level in 2021. Operator : The next question is from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Jim Snee : Good morning, Ben. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Ben. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask, first just a clarifier on the commentary in the press release that you are optimistic about revenue and earnings growth in FY 2021. I assume that\u2019s true even on a 52-week basis. And then I want to tack on to that, you highlighted and it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been a really unusual challenging two years from an external standpoint.  A number of elements that have caused volatility headwinds and inefficiencies, but you\u2019ve also been undergoing some significant supply chain adjustments over the last two years in Fremont in particular. I am curious we haven\u2019t seen earnings grow in a few years and I am wondering what kind of external environment do you think we need for the earnings growth potential of the business to shine through. And then, at what point do we start to see kind of steady state around the supply chain cost side of things as it relates to the adjustments that you\u2019ve made internally? Jim Snee : Yes. So, Ben, we certainly would agree it\u2019s been unusual and challenging. The work that our supply chain team has done has been absolutely phenomenal, not just with the Fremont transition, in the midst of this pandemic and making sure that we\u2019ve got one message consistently across the organization. The guidance or the comments that we\u2019ve made about sales growth does play out in a 52-week year.  Obviously, we\u2019ve got a 53-week year next year. But for us, the business we expect moderate growth in our retail business. So, if you go back to the grocery products business, I mean, we were showing steady growth in grocery products. Our foodservice business has been a shining star in our organization and continues \u2013 had been outperforming the industry significantly.  The investments that we\u2019ve made around our business out was deli and then, of course, our international business. But, for us, there is some returns. So just at that level of normalcy where we can see our retail businesses return to historical growth. Our foodservice business, the foodservice industry gets back to some level of normalcy.  We\u2019ve got the right investments. We\u2019ve got the right structure. We\u2019ve got the right businesses to take advantage of those market conditions. And so, it is obviously unusual and challenging. But we remain very, very confident in the way that we\u2019ve built the balance across the organization. We have improved sales capabilities on the ecommerce side.  We\u2019ve made investments in consumer insights and analytics. So, we\u2019ve done all the right things to support the growth of this business over the long-term. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then, the international business has had nice results in the midst of this challenging year. And this has exhibited nice growth over the last several years. I am curious, how big do you think that business can get? And when you think about opportunities as it relates to that business, you alluded to some of that in your opening comments, but I\u2019d be curious if you could elaborate a bit more on that segment? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, we think there is continued opportunities in China and then we\u2019ve really seen that team has strived. We\u2019ve built our new facility there in Jiaxing several years ago to support the expected growth and they\u2019ve delivered both on a retail and foodservice basis. They\u2019ve also, as we described had some great innovation from an M&A perspective. I talked about my desire to really add on to that great platform that we\u2019ve built both retail, foodservice and then even in retail ambience and refrigerated frozen.  So, it\u2019s got a lot of the great attributes that our domestic business has and we see opportunities for it to continue to grow organically and be supportive to M&A \u2013 from an M&A perspective. Our export business this year demonstrated the power of brands on a global basis with SPAM and SKIPPY showing great growth and we expect that to continue to grow.  So, again, just really optimistic on where the business is today, but then also the opportunities that exists organically and from an M&A perspective. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, Jim. Thank you and have a happy Thanksgiving. Jim Snee : Yes. You too, Ben. Operator : The next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. Couple questions. You mentioned new capacity that\u2019s coming online, some new plants, have you secured labor for that new capacity? I know, you had some labor issues, but I am not quite sure in which facilities or which regions it\u2019s happening. And then just a clarification, you said that you are expecting sales growth across all of your sales and profit growth, that\u2019s excluding the 53rd week, correct? Jim Snee : So, I\u2019ll start with the second one, Rob. Yes, we expect to be able to grow the business on a 52-week basis sales \u2013 sales and earnings, and then, of course, next year we do have our 53rd week as well. From a labor perspective, the two big labor needs are the plant in Omaha, Nebraska, the expansion of our dry sausage, our charcuterie line of products for Columbus.  And, yes, we\u2019ve had a lot of success securing labor for that facility, a bigger metropolitan area. And so, labor has not been an issue. The other big investment that we described with our Burke expansion in Nevada, Iowa and there again, we had a great labor force and we\u2019ve been able to secure additional labor in that facility as well.  In some of the other areas where we are expanding capacity with an additional line, we are confident we will be able to do that as we navigate through the COVID environment. But they are historically really strong labor markets for us. Our SPAM for example, we are expanding capacity here in Austin, Minnesota and Dubuque, Iowa, very strong labor markets for us. As we\u2019ve said, some of the more growth markets that can be a challenge for us of where we are currently expanding capacity we are actually in a good position. Robert Moskow : Okay. Good. And then, so I am going to give you some more questions here. In the back half of the year, I think you expect easier comparisons, because you\u2019ll have sufficient capacity in Chili and your other canned goods, I can\u2019t remember the other one. But I would imagine demand on those canned goods is going to be down a lot in the back half just because we\u2019ll have a vaccine and consumers will gain, so, have you factored that into your expectations for easy comps, but you might have the capacity, but you are going to have the same demand. Jim Snee : Yes. No, I think that\u2019s a great point, Robert. And we have \u2013 and so, what we are trying to say is, it\u2019s not going to be pound for pound in terms of the opportunity. But we do still expect there to be growth and the other part too considers the fact that, I mean, if this is we are talking about, we are largely growing before the pandemic. So, I mean, yes, we will have capacity. We understand and we said that we do expect continued growth at a slower rate. But we also know that we would face the current demands of the business. And so, when you factor those three things together, that\u2019s why we expect it to have a strong back half of the year. Robert Moskow : Okay. Lastly, on peanut butter, did you take a price increase this year? Your competitor was talking about the price increase that they took in their strong performance. Have you taken pricing and also are you satisfied with your share performance in peanut butter? Jim Snee : Yes. Thanks, Rob. We\u2019ve been really pleased with the performance of SKIPPY, even before the pandemic, the trends were really positive. We\u2019ve continued to perform well during the pandemic. We\u2019ve done a nice job gaining share. We are also taking pricing on peanut butter and, again, feel really good about where the business is trending.  We\u2019ve had \u2013 we haven\u2019t had any capacity constraints. The plant has been running well and then, we\u2019ve done a great job supporting this business through innovation. I talked about in my prepared remarks about how the team has done a great job in the midst of everything going on to continue innovation with SKIPPY Squeeze, SKIPPY High Protein, SKIPPY No Sugar, just lots of great work supporting that iconic brand. Robert Moskow : Okay. Great. Have a good holiday. Thank you. Jim Snee : Thank you too, Rob. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning, Michael. Michael Lavery : Can you just come back to the supply chain a little bit, and elaborate a little bit on the status or trending of savings from the One Supply Chain and I guess, the question is, it feels a little bit like the curveballs you had this year would make it a little bit like changing a tire while you are driving. But it still sounds like you are expecting that the savings to be coming through and not to progress.  And so, is it just maybe that you\u2019ve settled back into sort of a new normal group? How should we just think about the trajectory of how all that plays out? Jim Sheehan : Thanks, Michael. We are leading the supply chain savings that we laid out before the organization. In fact, we think some of those savings will be accelerated. Those savings have paid dividends in a very difficult operating environment this year and allowed us to do things that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to do in the past and other things that we did much more efficiently.  So we are very pleased with the progress we are making on One Supply Chain. It is a hard year to measure, because there are a lot of moving parts, but we believe that we\u2019ve met every expectation that we set originally on this and we think it\u2019s going to accelerate as we go through and continue to expand the efficiency of these operations. Jim Snee : Yes. And Mike, so, I mean, clearly, we\u2019ve had pretty significant cost increases. You think about PPE, team member bonuses, plant disruption cost, lower overhead recovery, and so, you are trying to measure it in a year where you\u2019ve got so many different pieces and your analogy of changing tire while driving is one that I haven\u2019t heard, but certainly it\u2019s very, very appropriate for the environment that we\u2019ve been in this year. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s great color. And then, just a follow-up on the retail side of the business and your expectations there. For the three quarters where you\u2019ve given the channel splits this past year, it was up 16%, 19% and now 7%. And so, again, even if 1Q was around flat, that\u2019s like a ten pace on a year.  Just to hold that sales level absolutely flat would seem quite impressive and so to grow over and above it, I know we\u2019ve touched on this already, but can you just maybe quantify some of what the capacity impact is? Or just how you are confident that that\u2019s a growth driver over and above the very high levels that you set for fiscal 2020? Jim Snee : Yes. So, I think from a capacity perspective, I talked a little bit earlier about SPAM. And we were constrained on our SPAM business, but are in a really good position because of expanded capacity. Our Chili, our Stew, our Hash business have had success, but it took sometime securing co-manufacturing. But we\u2019ve also internally been able to get to some extended runs.  Our complete business in terms of adding shifts to that business. So, from a capacity perspective, we feel really good about where we are heading into 2021. We obviously still understand everything that\u2019s happening in the world around us with these increased COVID cases and we are experiencing that first hand. I guess, from our perspective, we are \u2013 we believe the retail number is very realistic as we think about the full year, and then for us, really the key is to be able to meet the needs of the business. And so, as we head into 2021, capacity is at the top of our priority list. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just going back, I guess, to foodservice, so if you look longer term, do you see any impediments in getting back to your prior foodservice levels just given some of the \u2013 it seems like obviously larger restaurants, - permanent restaurant closures out there? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, we don\u2019t, Rupesh. I mean, we know the way that we\u2019ve attached the business structurally with the direct selling organization the way we\u2019ve innovated in the space, the relationships that we have with operators, clearly, the timing is uncertain. But I think over time, we do expect our foodservice business to continue to be a growth vehicle for our organization. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And I know there has been a number of questions just around cost on this call. Outside to the COVID costs, are you going to kind of expect to continue at least for the first half of next year? Anything you can share just in terms of other puts and takes in terms of cost, whether wages, freight, advertising, anything else we should be thinking about for the upcoming fiscal year? Jim Sheehan : I think, one of the things that we have had a challenge and that was in freight cost and that was because of some capacity constraints for us. That increase in freight cost had to do with that loading full trucks and sending trucks out of less than optimal levels.  So, as capacity goes up and production improves, we think that freight cost even though there is pressure on freight, but sending out trucks that aren\u2019t full is an expensive process. We think there is going to be improvements on that side of it. Again, with COVID cost, every day we learn a little bit more about how to operate more efficiently.  So, we continue to have a headwind on COVID cost that our operations become more efficient from probably a less direct cost standpoint. So, efficiencies in the plant to speed that you can run those types of things, but obviously for us, regarding COVID that\u2019s employee safety and that will be the highest priority. We will continue to invest what we need to invest in those cost to keep our employees safe. Jim Snee : And Rupesh, I would say, we are obviously making necessary investments in advertising back to supply chain. We\u2019ve talked a while ago about the new distribution center to support our grocery products business that continues to do really well even with the low balancing having to do.  And our teams are working on another distribution center to support the refrigerated foods business. So we continue to see opportunities to get better in that area. Jim Sheehan : The other area, Rupesh, that I\u2019d point out is that we\u2019ve made significant investments in Project Orion in 2020. We haven\u2019t called it out. We haven\u2019t separated it what the expenses as you might expect have been material. You can see some of that in our unallocated expenses this year where we\u2019ve closed down our HR benefits and finance portions of a project and there have been some expenses that impacted us in the fourth quarter too. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. Thank you for all the color. Operator : The next question is from Tom Palmer with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Good morning, and thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the inventory side. I mean, I can see on the balance sheet that inventory is up pretty substantially versus where it was a quarter ago. And you\u2019ve talked about actions you\u2019ve taken to kind of resolve that.  So, I guess, I really was looking to understand on next earnings call, are we going to see some lingering effects of this inventory constraint having weighed on first quarter, especially as we see kind of a resurgence of COVID cases and potentially pantry stocking again. Or is quite the opposite and you have the potential to get a catch-up where inventories were drawn down a quarter ago by your customers and now can you can backfill into it? Thanks. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Thomas. It\u2019s much like 2020. It\u2019s a mix of both. Our finished goods inventory is down. So there is some constraints that we\u2019ll have in Q1. Now Q1 is more of a quarter at which you sell more close to what you produce. It\u2019s not a quarter that you build inventory but it\u2019s also a quarter that normally you don\u2019t draw down a lot of inventory. So it\u2019s going to have a less of an impact in Q1 than perhaps it did in Q4, which is a period \u2013 a quarter in which you draw inventory down. You can\u2019t produce of a product during the quarter.  The other factor is, it\u2019s an increase in raw material or raw materials in inventory and that primarily comes back from products that are generally sold through the foodservice industry. In some instances, that means that we won\u2019t have to go out and buy products.  When you buy products on the open market, obviously you have fluctuations in those costs as product is put away and as foodservice returns to strength, we would be able to draw down that inventory and perhaps manage our cost a bit better in the foodservice areas. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that color. And then, just wanted to ask on pricing assumptions as we look towards the coming year. There were several segments or a couple segments where pricing rolled over sequentially. I assume that was mainly mix, but then when you are looking at positive growth in the coming year, how much of the burden is volume-driven and then how much is pricing? Jim Snee : Yes, Thomas, the big driver right now for pricing is, we talked about SKIPPY and then we are expecting an uptick in volume. We\u2019ve got opportunities to drive volume this year. But we \u2013 I mean, we do also have pricing power and we think about products that are tied more to underlying commodities on the retail side. So, you think about bacon, which is a big driver. Obviously, we\u2019ll be watching that closely. Jim talked about the belly market earlier. But I mean, it\u2019s volume-driven, but we know that we also have pricing power as well and we do have our SKIPPY pricing in place. Tom Palmer : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Hi, Ken. Ken Zaslow : There has been a lot of discussion obviously about your ability to the inventory levels, as well as your supply chain. Can you talk about how much demand did you leave on the table in 2020 that you\u2019ll get back in terms of in 2021 because of your capacity constraints? Can you put some sort of quantification to what actually was the impact in 2020? And what will be the benefit in 2021, as you gain your capacity? I know there is a lot of quality, I just don\u2019t understand how to actually model it. Jim Snee : Yes. That\u2019s a tough number to get at, Ken, I mean, I think, clearly, as we\u2019ve talked about the end of Q3 and given the warning signals into Q4, we had missed demand opportunities in SPAM, in some of our pepperoni business, sliced meats as we\u2019ve described and it is hard to quantify and we do think we\u2019ll be able to capture some of that back in 2021.  And then, it is, as I said, the supply chain, the structurally higher capacity is going to be a very key component for us in delivering the sales and earnings growth. But in terms of actually quantifying that number, that\u2019s a difficult number to get at. But we know the opportunity is there. Ken Zaslow : Let me just ask one more way of asking, maybe this is an easier way. How much more capacity will you have in 2021 than in 2020? Jim Snee : Well, that's going to depend on the product lines, but on the key areas, we think that there will be some significant expansion in capacity. We've talked about some of the plants that we've expanded on. So, as far as a dollar amount or a percentage, that's difficult.  Obviously, we continue to operate with the uncertainty of COVID, that how much impact is it going to have on our plants, which plants is it going to impact. Those are all the difficult \u2013 those are all the uncertainties that we're living with and we wish we knew exactly how hard we could run the plants and for how long, but that's a bit of a struggle with what we are looking at in 2021 to identify it down to a number. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then just the final question is, did you say that grocery profit will match sales? Or did I mishear that? I just didn't hear that. Jim Snee : I don't think we said that Ken. Ken Zaslow : Okay. Do you want to say something about that? How's that? Jim Snee : I mean, our bigger conversation rather than getting into the segments is, we think the channel discussion is really how to think about the business as we head into 2021. And, obviously, we've given some - we hope additional and good color around retail, foodservice, deli and international. Ken Zaslow : Great. Thank you. Be well, and have a happy Thanksgiving, guys. Jim Snee : Yes. You too, Ken. Operator : The next question is from Eric Larson with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Yes. Thanks, guys. I know we are running low on time and happy holidays to you here as well. Hope you have a good turkey day. The question and Jim alluded \u2013 Jim Sheehan alluded to it a little bit earlier and I had this question in mind. But I think you're now, I think, two years or so into your ERP update conversion, will fiscal 2021 require the same amount of capital?  I can't tell by your CapEx numbers, are kind of about where they were a year ago, maybe a little bit lower. But will that start being a net positive to your corporate expense line in 2021 or should we be thinking that the real benefits of reduced ERP expenditures come in F 2022? Jim Sheehan : There will be a reduction as you \u2013 as we go into 2021. As you think about this, we had three major paths to attain with Project Orion. First was HR and benefits. Second was to update the entire finance function, and third was supply chain. HR and benefits is completed. Finance is totally completed. For example, all of the staffing that had been assigned to Project Orion and the finance group have been pulled back to their old jobs, so those two are gone. Obviously, supply chain is a big task.  But as you look at the accomplishments, two out of three have now been completed as we go into 2021 and you will see significant benefits from what we've attained through Project Orion and efficiencies in the operations. And insight into the business, the amount of analytics that we are getting and the scope of information that we now have to operate the business has expanded drastically even in the last quarter. Eric Larson : Okay. Yes. Thanks, Jim. And so, my final question, I know this is a very 30,000-foot level question, but I think, Mr. Snee, you alluded to it a little bit in your prepared comments, but you said the consumers are enjoying being at home and cooking and that a lot of that will continue going forward. And I am sure you're talking to your customers. I mean, the debate here is customers \u2013 a lot of consumers say I am sick of cooking at home. I can't wait until we can go back to the restaurants. So, it's kind of a pull and tug argument. So, what are your consumers telling you when you talk to them about what their behavior changes might be? Jim Snee : Yes. I think you hit it right on the head, Eric, is that, especially early on, they enjoyed the time together. But there has been a bit of fatigue. But I don't know if that's going to entirely go away where a lot of consumers are missing the option of being able to get out into their favorite dining establishments. And I do think they've been able to take some advantage of that as foodservice operators have gotten better at on-the-go and or grab-and-go and delivery. But I do think we are going to see that shift away from dining at home, back into the foodservice channel, the key is at what rate. And so, that's why we're saying we expect a moderation of retail and we do expect an expansion of foodservice. The unknown is what is the right rate or the right number in 2021. But there is certainly fatigue, I think it\u2019s the right word to use. And we also know that over the long-term, consumers are going to maintain their need for convenience and versatility, which so much of our product portfolio, whether in retail or foodservice really hits hold. Eric Larson : Got it. Okay. Thank you and happy and safe holidays to all. Jim Snee : Thanks Eric. You too. Operator : The next question is from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Benjamin Theurer : Thanks. Good morning, Jim and Jim. Thanks for squeezing me in. Actually, first quick question for Jim Sheehan, could you clarify on the hog cost commentary? You said something like prices would be up, but then cost will be down, just to get this right from your commentary you had? Jim Sheehan : Sure, Ben. I'll try to clarify my comments. You are seeing forecast that the Western Corn Belt is going to be higher in 2021 than it was in 2020. So, for instance, in the fourth quarter, Western Corn Belt ran, let's say, mid-50s, probably 54 would be a good number, it's about 58 today. We think it's going to go up. But with the method in which we purchased hogs, that is one component and actually it's one of the smaller components in which we price the hogs that we buy. The more common method that we use or the higher percentage of hogs that are purchased are purchased on what's called the composite value. The composite value today is $78. And we see that as the basic range that it will be in for 2021. And that's actually down from where it was in the fourth quarter of 2020, I think it was at $83 on average in the fourth quarter.  So, we often warn people that you'll hear comments about the Western Corn Belt prices, but it's not the primary method in which we buy hogs. That's why we see some fluctuation in the cost of hogs as we go into the year, but not at the rate that you are hearing from those that are quoting that the Western Corn Belt. We do have hedges in place and those hedges are slightly below the future markets.  Now, we've had some negative impact in 2020 from our positions that we've put on to protect us from ASF, those are rolling off and have been replaced. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then, Jim Snee, just coming back to one of the prepared remarks commentary within the retail portion and the balance versus foodservice on those growth rates. So, one of the particular things I wanted to focus on is, the MegaMex JV, which you've actually highlighted to have seen some of the negative performance impacting on grocery because of the foodservice piece about it.  Could you elaborate a little bit on how that has performed on the retail side? And how that maybe have balanced versus foodservice? And what you're expecting on the demand side over the -- for that particular segment? Jim Snee : Yes. Great question, Ben. Our MegaMex business, especially on the retail side has performed really well. Again, even heading into or before the pandemic, that business was really strong for us. And not only just on an organic basis, but the work that our team has done from an innovation perspective. We talked about Herdez, guacamole, salsa.  This year, we've talked about some additional innovation that the team has been able to put in place. And so, the retail business was strong - continued very strong and we expect it to maintain the strength going forward. As you mentioned, the foodservice business, like our other foodservice businesses, were soft and \u2013 but we do expect over time to see those businesses recover as well. But we could not be more positive or optimistic about the future growth of our MegaMex retail business. We think it's really, really well positioned and it's on strategy for us as we think about our desire to grow our ethnic portfolio. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. So, net-net, it was still up, correct? Jim Snee : Yes. Yes. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Jim Snee : Great. Thanks, Ben. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Yes. Thank you. On behalf of the team here at Hormel Foods, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As I said earlier, I continue to be incredibly optimistic about our long-term performance. And we have done a great job navigating all the uncertainty COVID has brought. But I know that this Company has the right strategy, the right business fundamentals and we are on sound financial footing.  I want to wish all of you a happy Thanksgiving, and please stay safe and healthy during the holiday season. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. As we approach the one-year mark of the pandemic, I want to express my gratitude to our plant professionals for their continued dedication, energy and focus. They continue to be the true heroes of our company during this time. On our last earnings call in November, we were witnessing an increase of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Our number one priority has been to keep our team members safe, and we have been very focused on our best-in-class preventative measures and on educating our employees through our awareness campaign KEEP COVID OUT! As the pandemic evolves and the vaccine becomes more widely available to our team members, we'll continue to keep the health and safety of our team members as the top priority. We were among the first to offer a COVID pay program to allow those who were ill or had symptoms to stay home from work and still be paid. Additionally, we paid $11 million in fiscal 2020 in unconditional bonuses to our team members to provide further financial security. Our program has resulted in minimizing the spread of COVID in our workplaces and our communities. Recently, we've been encouraged to see cases decline, and the number of team members on our COVID pay program drastically decreased. This gives us increased optimism as we head into the second quarter. We are pleased to announce the entry into a definitive agreement to acquire the Planters business last Thursday. We have many leading brands at Hormel, and the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business will be an excellent addition to our company. Over the past 10 years, we've made numerous acquisitions, all of which are meeting our strategic objectives. The performances of MegaMex, Wholly, SKIPPY, AppleGate, Justin's, Sriracha, Fontanini, Columbus and Sadler's give us a high level of confidence in our ability to successfully integrate, operate and grow the Planters business. The acquisition of Planters is the perfect strategic fit. The addition of this iconic, branded, high-margin business continues our evolution as a global branded food company, moving us further away from a commodity-oriented, meat-centric company. As one of our biggest brands, we will give it a high level of focus and attention. Our core competency and brand stewardship will be key to our success in unlocking the power of the Planters brand. We know how to manage brands, and Planters is right in our sweet spot as we know, Planters is more than simply peanuts in a jar. Planters also perfectly complements, enhances and expands our existing snacking business, joining brands like Hormel Gatherings, Columbus, Wholly and Herdez. There are numerous opportunities to leverage the consumer insights from both portfolios to drive further innovation and improve growth for our entire snacking business. The Planters business gives us another iconic brand to grow and increases our scale in key areas such as center store and convenience stores. Integration into our direct sales force is a high priority, and we know there are immediate opportunities to improve distribution and drive sales growth. Another priority for us is to integrate the business into our One Supply Chain and Project Orion platforms. We expect synergies from this integration for the Planters business and for our existing business. There's a lot to love about this acquisition, and I'm excited for the transaction to close, so we can begin to give the Planters business the attention and focus it needs to grow. Now turning to our first quarter. Our team generated strong top line growth, with sales increasing 3% to a record $2.5 billion. All four segments delivered sales growth, an achievement that hasn't been accomplished since 2016. Incremental supply chain costs related to COVID-19 of $15 million were the primary reason for a $13 million decline in pre-tax earnings. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share declined 9% due primarily to incremental supply chain costs and higher tax expense. As in prior quarters, we continue to strike a balance between the consumer demand we are seeing and our supply chain's ability to meet that demand. We increased production levels this quarter through a combination of improving efficiencies, bringing on new capacity and further leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. We expect this steady improvement to continue throughout the year. We have been successful in a number of critical categories, and we will continue to make progress across the portfolio. Our retail business continued to perform extremely well, with sales increasing 13% for the quarter. Brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Chili, Hormel Black Label, AppleGate, Hormel Pepperoni, Lloyd's, Hormel Fully Cooked entrees and Justin's all delivered very strong growth. Most encouraging was the sales growth we saw from the Jennie-O brand. Every major retail category, including Jennie-O Lean Ground, turkey burgers, oven-ready items, bacon and marinated meats grew. The Jennie-O brand continues to resonate with consumers, and the efforts we have made on gaining back customer distribution are paying off. Our e-commerce business continues to be a bright spot as it almost doubled in the last 12 weeks according to IRI. We grew share in several key categories and have a high level of momentum in online grocery pickup, delivery and direct-to-consumer. Our deli channel sales increased 7% this quarter. Columbus-branded products led the way with exceptional growth from grab-and-go items. The opening of our new plant in Omaha this quarter, which produces Columbus Charcuterie products, will provide much-needed capacity for this business. While the Columbus brand was the clear leader for us this quarter in the deli, our team generated growth in every deli segment they compete in, including grab-and-go, prepared foods, behind-the-glass and fresh sliced deli meats. Our Party Tray business also grew volume and sales over the holiday season despite fewer group gatherings, a testament to our team's ability to keep this brand relevant. We saw positive signs of recovery in foodservice this quarter, even as the business declined 17% compared to last year due to the continued impacts of the pandemic on the industry. We continue to see strength in our business within important segments such as pizzerias, QSRs and convenience stores. Our direct sales force also made excellent progress pivoting to high-growth areas such as commissaries and ghost kitchens as they secured new distribution with both distributors and operators. Turning to the segments. Grocery Products delivered very impressive results this quarter. We saw top-line strength across many of our brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Compleats and Herdez, which led to volume increases of 4% and sales increases of 7%. We implemented a price increase for our SKIPPY business this quarter, once again demonstrating our ability to price in our categories. We are also encouraged with the performance of our recent innovative new items, including SKIPPY Squeeze, SKIPPY No Sugar and SKIPPY with added protein spreads. Our MegaMex joint venture had a strong performance this quarter as well, with equity and earnings increasing by 31%. This growth was led by our retail brands such as Wholly, Herdez, CHI-CHI'S and La Victoria. In addition to the MegaMex results, the 35% increase in segment profit was driven by higher sales and a favorable mix. Refrigerated Foods volume declined 2%, and sales increased 1%. Our retail and deli teams overcame see year-over-year declines in our foodservice business to deliver growth for our value-added business. Applegate had a particularly strong quarter, with growth fueled by both category momentum and share gains across core categories such as frozen breaded chicken, breakfast sausage, bacon and hotdogs. I continue to be optimistic about the momentum we are building in the Applegate business. We also delivered excellent results in our Hormel Pepperoni business both in foodservice and retail. Our teams continue to optimize the brand by focusing on our core products in the category and simultaneously leaning into our new Cup N' Crisp innovation. We plan to maintain our advertising efforts for Hormel Pepperoni to ensure we retain the households we gained during the initial pandemic buying. Refrigerated Foods segment profit declined by 16% due to lower foodservice sales, a significant decline in commodity profitability and increased supply chain expenses due to COVID-19. Profitability was also impacted by onetime start-up expenses related to our new plant in Omaha. Jennie-O volume decreased 2%, and sales increased 1%. We saw exceptionally strong retail and whole bird sales, which overcame significant declines in foodservice and commodity. Our retail business grew double digits this quarter, with growth coming from almost every category in which we compete. We have taken price increases across our portfolio and expect those to be effective late in the second quarter. Whole bird volumes increased by strong double digits due to a very positive holiday season. Our foodservice business was impacted by lower K-12 and college and university business in addition to continued weakness in the foodservice industry. Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 30%. Lower foodservice sales increased supply chain cost related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher freight expenses were key drivers to the lower profitability. Grain prices increased significantly during the quarter but only had a modest effect on earnings. We expect the primary impact of higher grain prices to affect the coming quarters. In addition to pricing action, we have taken additional actions to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. International volume decreased 5%. Sales increased 13%, and segment profit increased 61%. Once again, the strong sales and earnings performance was led by our retail and foodservice business in China. SPAM, SKIPPY and Beef Jerky were all key drivers to growth in China. We remain very positive about the short and long-term prospects of our China business. We also saw strong branded exports for brands like SKIPPY and SPAM. Similar to prior quarters, our affiliated businesses in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continue to show high levels of growth. Looking to the balance of the year, I am increasingly optimistic about delivering sales and earnings growth. As such, we are establishing fiscal 2021 guidance for the full year at $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the impact of the acquisition of Planters. Similar to prior quarters, we believe there are three key drivers to our near-term and long-term performance; retail dynamics, the recovery in the foodservice industry and the performance of our supply chain. Our retail, deli and international teams need to maintain their momentum and outperform their respective categories. Our brands continue to gain new households, and our repeat rates remain very strong. The depth of repeat, those consumers purchasing our brands multiple times, is incredibly positive with almost all new buyers for our brands making two or more repeat purchases during the first quarter. As a whole, our brands continue to make household penetration gains with brands like Herdez, La Victoria and Columbus increasing household penetration by over 20%. For the foodservice channel, we are optimistic about a foodservice recovery and confident in our ability to gain share during the recovery. During the pandemic, operators have been looking for products to simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. Our direct sales force continues to meet their needs with products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue and Hormel Bacon 1. The recent trends we are seeing in our foodservice businesses are positive. We have been able to react quickly to increased demand as cities and states have eased dining restrictions, allowing patrons to return to their favorite restaurants. We also anticipate our noncommercial business, such as K-12 schools, colleges and universities and healthcare to recover as the pandemic subsides. The most encouraging signs we are seeing are in our supply chain. We made excellent progress on increasing capacity to meet the high levels of demand from our customers. Steady week-over-week improvements, lower levels of absenteeism, new capacity and a continued vaccine rollout are all reasons we have a positive outlook. Our supplying team hit two major milestones this quarter; with the opening of our new dry sausage production facility in Omaha, Nebraska; and the opening of our pizza toppings expansion at Burke. Both projects were on time and on budget, which is truly amazing considering both projects were constructed primarily during the pandemic. Our plant teams have made progress on labor availability and in almost every location, our labor situation has improved. We expect that trend to continue into the second quarter and beyond as the vaccine becomes widely available for our team members. We now have a higher level of visibility into the coming quarters and remain confident in our team's ability to deliver our sales and earnings guidance this year. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter, give an update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Record sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%. COVID-related direct expenses of $15 million were the primary driver to pre-tax earnings declining $13 million or 5%. Absent the COVID expenses, pre-tax earnings would have increased. Total COVID expenses have started to decline from the prior quarterly run rate of $20 million. This was driven by higher volumes through our production facilities and improved efficiencies in our logistics network. Earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.41 compared to $0.45 last year. On an after-tax basis, first quarter results reflected approximately $0.04 per share in incremental COVID-related costs and higher tax expense. SG&A excluding advertising was 6.6% of sales, down slightly compared to the prior year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $34 million compared to $35 million last year. We continue to invest in our leading brands, including SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Pepperoni, Black Label and Jennie-O. Operating margins for the quarter were 10.9% compared to 11.8% last year. The decline was driven by COVID related expenses and the continued impact from lower foodservice earnings. Unallocated expenses included deferred compensation, expenses related to tax settlement and deal fees. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%. Last year's rate of 16.3% was affected by the large volume of stock options exercised in the quarter. Excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition, we expect the full year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%. Cash from operations was $206 million during the quarter, a 9% increase. Even with record sales, inventory levels continue to gradually improve throughout the quarter due to improvements in operations, labor availability, internal capacity expansions and increased use of strategic manufacturing partners. We expect inventories to continue to build throughout the second quarter. There is a risk for inflationary pressure on freight expense both domestically and internationally. However, we expect improved efficiency factors to offset some of the higher freight costs. We paid our 370th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 16 at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. During the quarter, the company repurchased 200,000 shares for $9 million. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. We opened the pizza topping expansion of Burke and the new dry sausage facility in Omaha. Work is also underway to expand our pepperoni capacity. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. Last Thursday, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire the Planters Snack Nut portfolio for an effective purchase price of $2.79 billion. The transaction was structured as an asset purchase and included a $560 million tax benefit. The adjusted 2020 EBITDA multiple on the effective purchase price of $2.79 billion was 12.5 times. This acquisition is financially attractive. Our disciplined approach to valuation allowed us to secure a leading brand at a multiple below the industry average, take advantage of historically low rates, increase our company sales by 10%, improve the profitability of the portfolio with accretive margins and responsibly leverage our balance sheet. We expect to finance the transaction with cash on hand and a combination of long-term and short-term debt. We will be able to borrow the funds at approximately 1.5% and expect to be able to significantly deleverage the debt in 18 months to 24 months. We are targeting a 1.5 times leverage by 2023 and are very focused on retaining a strong investment-grade rating. The cash flows from our existing business along with Planters allows us to maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy. We will continue to prioritize returning cash to shareholders in the form of annual dividend growth. Industry operating efficiencies, labor availability and production levels continued to improve during the first quarter, driving less volatility in the hog market compared to the back half of 2020. Hog weights are currently at historically high levels, which have led to balanced market conditions. In 2021, the USDA is projecting pork production to increase 1%. With an expected recovery in the foodservice industry and higher grain prices for the balance of the year, we anticipate hog cost to increase. Our balanced mix of hog and pork supply contracts will help us manage the risk of higher prices. The USDA complies the cutout was in line with last year during the first quarter. Recently, we have seen strength in the cutout, supported by strong demand for pork domestically and internationally. We continue to monitor export demand and ASF in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. ASF continues to be a risk in the pork industry. We have seen the disease could be successfully managed in areas with modern agricultural practices. We expect higher prices for pork with less volatility than last year. The strength of our brands and balanced approach to procurement continue to be a competitive advantage. Pork trim markets are expected to remain higher during the second quarter of 2021 and decline in the back half as labor availability and processing plants improves. Beef trim prices are expected to be lower in 2021. We anticipate belly prices to be volatile in the near term driven by strong demand and foodservice industry growth. Strong Chinese demand and drought conditions in South America continue to generate higher grain prices, which is expected to negatively impact Jennie-O Turkey Store. Like the pork industry, we are closely watching the fundamentals for grain. The primary factor we are watching are global demand, planting intentions for the coming season and weather conditions in South America. We manage freight costs through a combination of spot buying, derivatives and adjusting feed formulas. Additionally, we have announced pricing action across all Jennie-O products to protect our profitability. We are prepared to take additional actions as conditions change. Fundamentals in the turkey industry remain mixed. Egg sets, hold placements and cold storage are below year ago levels, while prices for commodity breast and thigh meat remain depressed. Poult placements have been declining recently, which will likely lead to lower levels of supply. Because the foodservice industry is a key outlook for breast meat, as the foodservice industry recovers, breast meat pricing is expected to improve. We are finalizing the implementation plans for the Planters business. We will have the HR and payroll functions integrated by the closing date. The finance and supply chain will be fully implemented within one year of closing. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : I want to start - you called out the comments related to grain cost pressures in Jennie-O. And I want to focus there, if we could, for my first question. You talked about your actions around pricing. I'm wondering, to the extent that you're able to talk about how severe or meaningful, the higher costs are expected to be for you? And as you think about pricing increases, what you think the receptivity from the market is of higher prices? And how meaningful that offset could be to the higher prices? Jim Snee : Thanks, Ben. Obviously, this is a high priority for the Jennie-O Turkey Store team going forward. But they've been working over, really, the last month or so to implement pricing. And while they're not entirely done, I would tell you that there's been a lot of success in terms of getting pricing through. Obviously, the rationale that we have in terms of what's happened in the grain market supports - very strong underlying support. So the team has done a nice job there. And as we go forward, the idea of elasticity with pricing is something that has been difficult to measure given the pandemic. What we do know is we've continued to see exceptional demand for the Jennie-O Turkey Store retail products. So we remain very optimistic on the success that this business can have for the balance of the year. Jim Sheehan : So Ben, just to give you some type of scope. Cornmeal is up you some type of scope. Corn Nuts up about 40%, while soybean meal was up about 15%. Now we have a significant position. It's less than half of our corn hedged at a lower price than the current markets. And we have the ability to change the formula. So as you can imagine, we're moving the formula to more of a soybean meal-based formula away from corn. That will offset a portion of the cost. So really there's multiple approaches we've taken to mitigate the risk around these increases. Jim talked about a very effective approach on price increases, along with the shifting of the feed formula and the positions that we've taken. And we took these positions probably six - more than six months ago. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. My second question is related to the supply chain. And obviously, you've made a number of investments over the last several years. You've gotten a few capacity expansions stood up here in this first quarter. And Jim Sheehan, you made some comments that you expect some of the freight - higher freight headwinds to be offset by supply chain improvements. Can you talk about the - as you get through some of these enhancements that you made with Orion, some of the capacity expansion starting to mature in terms of fixed cost absorption, the benefit that afford you on the supply chain cost equation relative to any cost inflation you might see, that would be helpful. Jim Snee : Yes. Ben, I'll go ahead and start on the freight costs, and I'll let Jim finish with Project Orion. But one of the things that we have been challenged with is our supply chain has battled over last year and early this year is that we've had a number of inefficiencies in terms of how we're - how we've been able to ship trucks. And so because of that, we've had some higher freight costs and haven't had the opportunity to optimize our loads like we typically do. So we have seen some higher freight costs. And while there are expectations that freight rates will increase, we see a pretty significant opportunity for us to be able to offset a good portion of those as our supply chain continues to pick up momentum and we're able to fill trucks in a more optimized manner. So yes, there'll be some flip freight inflation. But again, we think there's going to be a really good opportunity for us to offset that with some internal efficiencies. Jim Sheehan : Ben, I'll talk a little bit about your second portion of your question, and that's how Project Orion will benefit us in this area. First of all, we have visibility across all of the businesses under one platform. And that's given us great insight as to where our costs are coming from and how we can manage those costs from a purchasing aspect, the - having all purchasing done under one platform, giving visibility into the costs. The other thing is that on freight, we're able to do some significant analysis as to where we can provide benefits on freight and how we can improve our load levels, what our load levels are actually running across our business organizations. So it is providing a significant benefit as we go through. And it's very timely as we're hitting probably a bit of a period of inflation going forward to understand what our actual costs are and what levers we can pull to manage those costs. Operator : The next question will be from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So first, I actually wanted to quickly follow up on last week's Planters acquisition. I was just hoping maybe you could give us some more insight into the private-label dynamics in Planters categories and the gross margins there. And then lastly, Kraft also made reference to Planters as a commodity. So how do you think about its categories in terms of being a commodity? Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning, Erica. I'll go ahead and I'll take that one. I think the other thing that we talked about last week was the items that you just mentioned. I mean those were at the top of our list in the due diligence process. And our team did a phenomenal job, not just identifying those risks, but really putting together an action plan for when we do own the business, how we can offset that.  When we think about private label, when we across our existing categories, private label shares can range across the board. And right now, what we're seeing is the average center store range is about 20%. And the Planters brand, as they face private label, they're seeing about the same percentage of private label. And again, that's across the board, there's different subcategories. So the idea of a private label being a risk, a threat, a competitor, not new to us at all. So obviously, we're prepared to manage our business accordingly.  From a gross margin perspective, I think what we had talked about last week was probably a little lower down in terms of profitability. But without giving too many specifics, it's safe to say that Planters' gross margins are - they're well above our total company average, and they're also above our Grocery Products average.  And then the other thing, just in terms of the category, we know how to manage brands. We've said that multiple times. And so when we think about commodities and pricing and price elasticities, this brand is very similar to all of our other large brands. So yes, not new to us. We know how to manage it. And when you roll all those things up, from our perspective, this business is not a commodity business. I would go so far to say, again, from our perspective, we know a commodity business when we see one. And this is not a commodity business. So hopefully, that's helpful. Erica Eiler : Yes. No, that's very helpful. And then just switching gears to Grocery Products. I mean you're obviously facing some challenging comparisons here the next couple of quarters. Can you maybe again, just talk a little bit more about your confidence in lapping this growth? Any puts and takes you can share with regards to how you're thinking about these laps, I think, would be really helpful? Jim Snee : Sure. I think that there's going to be a lot of puts and takes across the entire portfolio for the balance of the year. We know in the second quarter, we saw the significant run-up in Grocery Products. But we also saw the significant collapse of our foodservice business. And so - and then in Q4, if you recall, we talked about the difficulties we were having in our supply chain and meeting the absolute demand that we are getting from our customers.  So there's a lot of give and take for the remaining three quarters. As we've laid out the business with our business units and reviewed how we think the business is going to flow and it\u2019s their optimism that obviously fuels my optimism, and also the results that we are seeking the supply chain. And all of this do not discount the impact of supply chain and allowing us to achieve our goal this. So - they run so much better its really made a difference in our business. So all those things together Eric has really what has allowed us to reinstate our guidance and become increasingly optimistic about the business for the balance of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Wanted to take you up on the capacity side of it, and kind of, explore that a little bit. Can you talk about what products were capacity constraints? Which products are not capacity constraint now? And which ones won't be capacity constraint in the future? And then what do you think with the scope of the cost that was associated with that? Jim Snee : Well, I'll take the first part. And I'll let the CFO take the numbers part Ken. You know the biggest constraints that we saw, and we talked about this in Q4 was really in our in our grocery products business. You know, spam at the time was one that was capacity constrained. We knew that we had a capacity expansion that we were in the process of, and we saw that capacity come online in few one, and that's really helped our spam business. But we call our general canning business which would Chilly, Stew, Hash. You know that is one where we most recently identified co-packer opportunities. And we expect - we're still not in demand, but we expect that to continue to improve over the balance of the year.  I think we did talk about pepperoni in Q4 that we had a new line that was getting up to speed. And that has done just that and that's really afforded us the opportunity to expand both our retail and foodservice pepperoni business. So, you know, as we look to the future, you know, part of the optimism is - we are far less capacity constrained. You know, clearly we're not out of the woods. We've got to meet customer demand. But I think everything that we said we were going to do, and that we knew that we needed to do in Q4, as happened. Jim - I don't know from a cost perspective. Jim Sheehan : Sure. Good morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Good morning. Jim Sheehan : The last half of 2020 was, as Jim said, tremendously impacted by supply chain challenges. So as we look at it from a financial standpoint, the first area that we should talk about is foodservice. We've seen some very interesting trends in the last, let's say, few weeks on foodservice. And we have idle capacity in foodservice. So we have no problem filling that foodservice need. So any growth in the foodservice category is unrestrained and a great opportunity for us is that business. So we're confident it's going to continue to improve. In the Grocery Products category, we talked about a tremendous Q2 that we had. But Q3 and Q4, I think it's safe to say were crippled by supply chain challenges that really are not existing anymore. The availability of labor is much better than it was last year. And so that's going to be able to allow us to grow Grocery Products in the back half of the year. Jim talked about Refrigerated Foods, how we've had some constraints in the pepperoni business. And that we have additional capacity that's come online there, and we're doing a very nice job of recovering the pepperoni business and actually seeing some very significant growth in pepperoni in the foodservice. So I think it's hard to underestimate how much of an impact the constraint had in 2020 and the opportunity that we have in 2021. And one of the other things that we haven't talked a lot about is that during this time of constraint, we've found some very significant efficiencies in our operations that have helped us produce product even in a difficult time period. Now as we increase it, we'll be able to take those efficiencies and actually drive cost issues and efficiency issues throughout the operations. Ken Zaslow : I fear I might underestimate the capacity. Can you give us some dimension to how we think of - how that could actually add, not just to this year but really to 2022 and 2023? And I'll leave it there, and I appreciate it. Jim Snee : Well, I think as you've seen the growth in some categories, you see our ability that if we could fill that full demand. There would be some important improvements. I think - as I've talked about in - Grocery Products, I think, is a good benchmark, where we see growth in the back half of 2021 in Grocery Products strictly based on improvements in the supply chain. Jim Sheehan : Yes. And Ken, I would just add, I mean, the other factor that's unknown at this point are really the channel dynamics. And so, as perhaps retail - as people are looking to get away from home and eat out, as Jim mentioned, our foodservice capacity is ready, willing and able to meet that demand. So I think that's going to be an even more important part of our story as we get to the back half of 2021 and into 2022 as we see foodservice recovery continue. Operator : And the next question will be from Eric Larson with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Thanks everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So Jim Sheehan, quick question for you. You talked about the financing rates for Planters. Just for clarification, is that 1.5% just on the incremental debt that you're going to borrow? Or is it the blended rate between the percentage of cash and debt that you're going to use to finance the transaction? Jim Sheehan : It's a blended rate of the debt, including the $1 billion that I took out in June of last year. And for instance, we'll be retiring $250 million worth of debt in April that has a 4.25% rate. So if you think about that interest in the current interest rates, we'll be retiring some reasonably high level interest rate debt and replacing it with much lower interest rate. Eric Larson : And my second question is for Mr. Snee. Jim, the pandemic has obviously impacted the foodservice Turkey markets pretty significantly. And the oversupply in that industry has been pretty significant for a while. We just haven't seen that - the industry recover like, I thought, we would have a long time ago. Will the current pandemic, maybe rationalize the industry, a little bit more? Will you come out of the back end of this potentially, with a stronger - maybe lower supply - structurally supplied industry? Jim Snee : Yes. Eric, I mean, I don't know. And I wouldn't want to comment on, what some of our competitors might do. From our perspective, we feel really good about the work that we've done, leading into the pandemic, if you go back to some of the stumbles, we had. But then, the effort and the strategic focus on growing distribution in lean ground turkey, right before the pandemic hit, I believe that a lot of the success, we've had on the retail side is directly attributed to that expanded distribution that the team was able to achieve. In terms of what inventories look like, I mean, clearly, a lot of breast meat. Turkey breast meat is used in the foodservice industry. And so that collapse, has had a dramatic impact. And obviously, there are implications to that across the entire industry. What we have seen is continued strength in the retail business, some recent increase in our Jennie-O foodservice business. And so we believe, that there's a lot to be positive about with our Jennie-O Turkey Store business heading forward. Jim Sheehan : Eric, the item that I would add would be, that we've been looking at the fundamentals in this industry for a long time and reminding others that, that's probably the best indication of where the business is going. We've seen decreases in pork placements for several months now. But in January, egg placements are down 9% and pork placements were down 12%. I think that's a strong indication of where the industry is going from a capacity standpoint. Operator : And our next question will be from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Thanks for taking my question. Jim, just the first question, I wanted to ask about the color you gave around pork inflation. And maybe it's a bit of a two-parter. The first part of that being, I guess, the inflation that you're seeing now would appear to be more, I guess, tangible versus 2019 when it seemed like it was more speculative around ASF and whether or not there was going to be a lot more shipment of pork out of the U.S. I just want to see if that's, A, a fair statement or at least how you're thinking about it internally. And then B, you mentioned a bit around consumer elasticity on Turkey, but just is there anything from your consumer insights team on the pork side that you're seeing any changes in consumer behavior that would make you feel more confident maybe this time around in your ability to get pricing on bacon, pepperoni those types of items? Jim Sheehan : Well, I think the first issue, Peter, is part of this is going to depend on the recovery in foodservice. So if you take the bellies, bellies are up 1.95 right now. They have been running in the one - mid-1.30 range. I think that's an indication that there is some recovery in the foodservice, that there is an expectation that, that demand is going to pick up. We expect these - these prices for the full year to run in the mid-1.40s, somewhere in that range, which is above last year's levels. One of the other things that you're seeing, though, is that you're going to have some probably pressure taken off of certain markets. Trim markets are in the 90s right now, and I still think that's a component of the fact that there's not enough labor to do the boning. As labor returns into these facilities, those prices are going to go down. That's just a labor issue. So we think the bellies are going to be volatile as we go through. And demand is going to have - be impacted by the foodservice recovery. Jim Snee : Yes. And Peter, I mean, we remain very confident in our ability to price. Already this year, we've taken price on SKIPPY. We talked about the Jennie-O Turkey Store pricing. We've had bacon pricing Columbus, and really our total deli business has taken pricing as well. So as we obviously follow the inflationary factors and see what's happening in the business, we feel very confident in our ability to price. Peter Galbo : Okay. Thank you both. That's very helpful. I guess just two quick clarifying questions here. One, on Grocery Products, just - there was an acceleration, right? And some of that was the capacity unlocked. But I just wanted to make sure, was there any inventory - like retail or inventory rebuild in that first quarter number? And then on the investment income, the rabbi trust, just that was up quite a bit. So how do we think about that maybe in 2Q and for the rest of the year? Does it reverse? Just we have to put something in the model. Thanks very much. Jim Snee : Yes. Peter, I would say that no, there really hasn't been any retailer inventory rebuild. And I say that just based on the demand we're seeing and our ability to fill that demand. And so I do think it - obviously, there's still very strong consumer demand. But then it also speaks to the fact that at some point, we are going to have the opportunity to fill the pipeline as well. Jim Sheehan : And thanks for the question on the interest income. That's coming from our rabbi trust, which backs up our deferred compensation program. Any gain that we have in interest expense, if you look at our corporate unallocated line, that's up so much this quarter that is an expense that offsets the gain in interest expense. So when you look at the net of the additional deferred comp expense I incurred in unallocated and the gain that I've seen in the interest income, they offset each other. They appear at two different spots on the financial statements, but theirs is an offset there. So there is no benefit on an EPS basis of the increase in investment income. It's offset in the above-the-line unallocated line. Does that help you at all? Peter Galbo : Yes. No, it does. I guess just as we think about that number going forward, it can be pretty volatile from quarter-to-quarter. And so I guess just what's the best way to think about it? Jim Snee : Sure. The best way to think about it is, it has no impact on the company's results because whatever gain or losses accrue in interest income are offset by gains and losses in corporate unallocated. So it has no impact on my P&L. Operator : And the next question comes from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : First, I just wanted to ask on the CapEx side. You cut your outlook, I think, by $90 million this morning. Just curious what drove the reduction? Is this to free up some CapEx for Planters? Are there other specific projects that maybe were halted or pushed into 2022? Jim Sheehan : Yes. It's a great question, Tom. And it is - it's one big project that we've gone ahead and pushed back later in the year, and we expect the majority of that expense to fall into next year. So it's not a cancellation. It's not a need for additional capital. It's just a delay in a project that we will still complete. Tom Palmer : Can you disclose what that project is? Jim Sheehan : No. We haven't announced that yet. It hasn't been approved. Tom Palmer : Okay. And then on the Jennie-O side, I just wanted to make sure I understood the timing of costs versus pricing. Should we think about the second quarter as being the toughest margin quarter, just given that pricing is being instituted during the quarter and we're seeing that input cost inflation now? And then a quarter ago, you mentioned Jim Sheehan, 9% EBIT margin as maybe an outlook for this year. Do you have an updated outlook how we should maybe be thinking about that full year? Jim Sheehan : Sure. You're exactly right, Tom, that the second quarter is going to be the biggest challenge for Jennie-O as they absorb the cost. But as you know, when you bring pricing on, there's a ramp-up period and a wait period for that pricing to be effective. So that will have an impact in Q2, and it will slightly impact what we talked about previously as far as margins but not significantly, but it will have a minor impact on my expectations for Jennie-O. Operator : The next question will come from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : A couple of questions. Jim and Jim, you mentioned some interesting trends in foodservice demand over the last few weeks, and I think you mentioned pepperoni being one of them. Can you give us a little more color on what type of restaurant change you're seeing that from? And do you think that's just a response to declining COVID rates? And then secondly, there's a lot of pricing in the International division during the quarter. Can you give more specifics as to what that pricing was for? And mathematically, is that - should we expect that level of pricing throughout the year? Jim Snee : Yes. Rob, I'll go ahead and start. I mean, from a foodservice perspective, I mean, it is your more traditional restaurants, fast-casual pizzerias that we mentioned, QSRs, where we're seeing strength in the business. We haven't seen a pickup in some of the travel venues in terms of hotels. But as we've seen the business continue to improve towards the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, really some of our best weeks since the pandemic began. So we had also seen some increased business. It would have been probably end of October, early November before the second wave began. So we know that it's not new and that the trends are real, and we believe that we're going to be able to sustain this going forward. And then the pepperoni business has really been ongoing throughout the pandemic because that is an area that really never slowed down. Any slowdown for us was just capacity-driven, which now we have our new line up to speed, and we're meeting those expectations. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Rob. Regarding our International business, it is a broad-based improvement in our business. There isn't an area of this business that hasn't improved, and it's certainly not a result of pricing. It's better results in our - our operations in Brazil and in China. It's more profitability within our exports, both branded and fresh pork. So it's an improved mix, but it's really no - I mean pricing isn't the driver here. This is just a broad-based improvement in business internationally in all aspects of International. Jim Snee : And we expect our International business to remain strong for the balance of the year, Rob. Robert Moskow : Okay. But maybe if I could, am I reading this wrong? I thought volume was down in International, but sales were up 13%. So is it a mix driver? Jim Snee : That's a mix issue. Robert Moskow : Okay. What's driving the mix? Is it SKIPPY and SPAM drives the mix positive? Jim Snee : Yes. Yes, I mean, it's the branded products that are - that have a high demand internationally that is driving the better mix. Operator : And the next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : I just want to make sure I understand some of the trajectory for Refrigerated Foods and the margins. You've called out some of the headwinds, and those are clear. But it looks like the margins might have been the lowest since around 4Q 2015. I know you mentioned some of the second half catalysts or benefits that should come through. Does it get worse before it gets better? Or are we - should we expect an upswing already from here? What's some of the puts and takes maybe between now and into the second half? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, the positive for Refrigerated Foods, obviously, are the strength in the foodservice recovery. And so if we expect to continue on the path we're on, that will be a very positive impact. Refrigerated Foods also gets hit the hardest in - with COVID costs. And so as we see COVID costs hopefully mitigate over the balance of the year that will continue to be - or have a positive impact on Refrigerated Foods as well. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the second quarter-to-date what you've seen, just any color maybe you can give? And is there - sort of in the moment, but any maybe weather watchouts or any impact on Sadler's production? I know we've also seen some reports about maybe some risk to things like cattle, but it doesn't seem like maybe hogs are affected. So just any update on maybe kind of think what you're watching now. Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, obviously, this week was a difficult week for a lot of people. We saw a large spike in spot prices for natural gas. We made some quick decisions to mitigate the increase. And then the other thing is not all of our locations are impacted. So, any of the impact, Michael, is really short-term and nothing that's going to have a broad-based, longer-term impact on the business. Operator : The next question will be from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Good morning Jim and Jim. Just 1.5 quick ones. So, first of all, could you elaborate a little bit on how organic growth was versus inorganic, because if I remember right, still the first quarter did benefit from Sadler. You used to give those data points in past earnings releases, but I couldn't found it in this one. So, just to understand like the underlying dynamic without Sadler's, how was the performance here? Jim Snee : Well, without Sandler's - and obviously, Sadler's is not a large sales volume business, but it's still up without Sadler's. So, on an organic basis, our sales are up. Ben Theurer : And then just following up quickly on the commentary around the international piece. I think you've mentioned earlier as well some of the headwinds on the freight side. So just to understand what your expectations are when it comes to freight on the International business, just to serve those markets because clearly, international has been a surprisingly good market in most recent quarters. But obviously, there needs to be the delivery of product as well. And just to understand what you're seeing on the freight side and the international context. Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, the most difficult part, Ben, is really just making sure that we secure the containers for that business. And so that's really been the focus of our team. When we talk about overall freight, we talked about low single-digits. I mean that's inclusive of International. So that's our total company per view of how we're thinking about freight. Operator : The next question will be from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Sarah Davis : This is Sarah Davis on for Adam. Just a quick question around the guidance for me. I guess, thinking about the ranges, so on the sales side, kind of implying between 1% and 7% growth year-over-year. So I guess, anything you can provide, just helping us think about what state of the world gets you to the high versus low end of the range would be super helpful. Appreciate it. Jim Snee : Yes. It's a great question, Sarah. I mean, it really is as long as there aren't significant downturns in any of the channels. I mean, you might expect some softness as one picks up, it's going to have an offsetting impact to another. But we believe that our foodservice business is really going to be the key driver for us for the balance of the year. And so, what that recovery actually looks like, I think is going to play a large part in where we fall in the range. But we also do expect to see our retail business, whether it's Grocery Products or our Refrigerated Foods retail businesses, still provide some growth. So as I said, I think the biggest thing for us is what happens with foodservice. We do believe it's going to recover. It's going to improve. The rate and the scale at which that happens is really going to have a big impact on that outlook. Operator : And the next question is a follow-up from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : I appreciate the follow-up. Two parts; one is, when you're taking the pricing increase, is it covering the current environment? Or is it anticipatory? And the increase in volume from Jennie-O was it any sort of pre-buying ahead of the price increase? Jim Snee : Yes. No, great questions, Ken. Yes, that pricing is to cover the current environment. And then no, none of the performance at Jennie-O would have been by it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. As we discussed, there is a lot of momentum across all parts of our business. We also know there is work to do to deliver our sales and earnings guidance this year. But we also know that we have the right people, the right portfolio to deliver the results that we need. Thanks again for joining us. Stay warm and stay safe. Operator : And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please refer to Pages 26 through 32 in the company's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 24, 2021. It can be accessed on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. Once again this quarter I want to recognize the heroic work of our production team members. This team deserves much of the credit for our record sales results this quarter as they continued working to produce safe, high-quality food for millions of consumers and customers. Our number one priority has been to keep our team members safe and our cross-functional COVID-19 leadership team is ensuring we are on the leading edge of the country's vaccination efforts. To date, we have fully vaccinated over 51% of our domestic workforce, which is well ahead of the country's vaccination rate. We are encouraged by the rapid decline in cases in our communities. From a top line perspective, our balanced business model has again proven to be a winning formula as our team delivered record sales for the second quarter and first-half. In total, sales for the quarter increased 8% compared to last year, and the sales increased over 5% for the first-half of the year. A key driver of our sales performance is the rebound in our foodservice business. As expected, our foodservice team experienced a strong recovery and took numerous actions to properly position our organization to capitalize on the industry recovery. For the quarter, foodservice sales increased 28%. This reflects an increase of 1% over 2019 pre-pandemic levels. This is a significant accomplishment especially knowing where the industry was just a few short months ago. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our foodservice teams have been doing their part to support the industry. Within days of the crisis, we worked closely with our distributor and operator partners to assist their businesses in many different ways, whether it was a rebate program to offset food costs, extending payment leniency, helping adjust to the new takeout, delivery, and pickup environment, or simply being available to personally check in with a restaurant tour to see how they were doing. Our confidence in the industry recovery never wavered. We know these actions benefited our distributor and operator partners, and are playing a part in our outperformance of the broader industry trends. During this difficult labor environment our experienced and tenured direct sales force is helping operators meet their accelerating demand with products that simplify their food preparation, save time, and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. Products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoked barbecue, Fontanini authentic Italian meats, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly guacamole, and Jennie-O Turkey are uniquely positioned to meet this need. The brightest spot in our foodservice portfolio has been our pizza toppings business. Prior to the pandemic, we capitalized on the continued growth in this category, especially for premium products, and invested heavily in capacity to meet future demand. We have also been investing in plant-based offerings and are seeing growth from our plant-based pepperoni and Crumbles products. We're excited to leverage our expertise in the pizza toppings category to drive growth in plant-based toppings. With our new capacity expansion, at Burke, and with additional pepperoni capacity set to open at the beginning of fiscal 2022, we are set up nicely to meet the consistent growth we have seen in this space. With the foodservice industry recovery well underway, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our valued partners, invest in our direct sales team, and support the industry's return to growth with innovative, convenient, and flavorful product solutions. In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remain healthy, with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Total retail sales this quarter were flat to last year as we lapped the months when consumers were stocking their pantries in anticipation of the pandemic. Sales finished up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2019. And we continue to see strength from our leading brands, such as SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Black Label, Herdez, and Wholly. As a reminder, we experienced an immediate and sustained demand surge for shelf-stable products in the Grocery Products segment at the onset of the pandemic. The second wave of demand that impacted our perishable and refrigerated items happened weeks later in the third fiscal quarter. Sales in the deli channel increased 4% this quarter, and are up 9% over pre-pandemic levels. Hormel Gatherings Party Trays delivered strong growth as consumers started to spend more time with family and friends, and consequently are purchasing more products to entertain their guests. The Columbus brand remains a cornerstone for our deli business, and is now benefiting from the opening of our new plant in Omaha, which is providing much needed capacity. Columbus is a leader in charcuterie, and we now have the capacity to continue expanding distribution. Across the retail and deli space our consumer takeaway metrics continue to be positive according to IRI. Many of our brands have made large gains in household penetration, overall buy rates are improving, and we are seeing an expansion in cross-purchasing across our brands. E-commerce sales grew double digits in the last 12 weeks according to IRI, and we are gaining share in important categories. We will continue to increase our investment in this important channel. Throughout the quarter, our supply chain continued to improve as we were able to increase production levels through a combination of gaining efficiencies, increasing capacities, and leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. Another area we have made great strides is in our distribution network. Over the last year, we have opened a new grocery product distribution center, and in recent weeks have opened a refrigerated distribution center serving the West Coast. These strategic investments will reduce overall freight miles in costs, improve our customer service levels, support growth for our value-added businesses, and reduce greenhouse emissions. From a bottom line perspective, operating income showed a slight decline. We saw raw material and feed prices rapidly increase throughout the quarter. We have taken pricing actions in many categories, but did not see the full benefit of these actions during the quarter. As we have previously discussed, in volatile market conditions pricing will lag the markets which will shift profits to subsequent quarters. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year. A higher tax rate negatively impact earnings by $0.01 per share compared to last year. Turning to the segments, refrigerated foods volume increased 3% and sales increased 17% with growth coming from almost every division. Value added sales increased 18% driven by a significant recovery in the food service businesses. As anticipated, we saw a rapid increase in food service demand as the quarter progressed. Almost all categories within food service grew sales led by our pizza toppings portfolio and brands such as Fontanini and Bacon 1. In fact, pepperoni, pizza toppings, Bacon 1, and Fontanini authentic Italian meats all showed growth compared to the second quarter of 2019. We also experienced a recovery in the premium breakfast portfolio with growth from our Old Smokehouse brand. Additionally, we saw excellent growth from our premium prepared proteins which include brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Caf\u00e9 H, and Sadler's. These items are key to our pre-strategy. Items that pre-marinated, pre-cooked, pre-sliced, and fully prepared. As the industry recovery accelerates into the summer and labor remains a predominant challenge for most operators, our line of products offer convenient, safe, versatile, and flavorful solutions. Our retail and deli teams delivered a strong quarter on the top line with growth coming from products such Black Label bacon, Hormel Gatherings, APPLEGATE, Lloyd's barbeque, Hormel PEPPERONI, and Columbus prepared foods items. Refrigerated foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher food service sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability, and decreased operational expenses due abating COVID-19 cost pressures. International delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth with sales increasing 17% and segment profit increasing 6%. The performance of the team in China remains impressive. Food service volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings, and bacon items. Retail demand for the SPAM and SKIPPY brands has also been outstanding. The company's innovative offerings including Beef Jerky, SKIPPY snacking items, and two new SPAM varieties are providing additional avenues for growth. And we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our China business. Branded exports also grew with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher food service sales, and improved margins on fresh pork items. In addition, our partners in the Philippines, South Korea, and Europe continue to experience elevated demand for shelf-stable products. Grocery products results were strong given the difficult comparison to last year due to the extremely high levels of demand experienced at the onset of the pandemic. Even though volume declined 14%, sales declined 8%, and segment profit declined 23%, we are encouraged by the segment's performance as we have seen sustained consumer demand for many of our brands compared to pre-pandemic levels. Sales for center store brands such as SPAM, Hormel Chili, Compleats, and Mary Kitchen hash were all over 20% higher compared to our second quarter of 2019. We will continue to support our leading brands including SKIPPY, SPAM, Compleats, HERDES, WHOLLY, Justin's, and Hormel Chili. And we're resuming promotional activity as inventory levels normalize. Our MegaMex joint venture performed well as equity and earnings increased 26%. Both the HERDES and WHOLLY brands grew as consumers looked for authentic and convenient Mexican products to enhance their at-home eating occasions. The Herdez brand continues to outperform the salsa category. This brand has grown households by 3 million since the start of the pandemic, and has introduced industry leading innovation to the marketplace in recent years. Following the highly successful performance of Herdez Guacamole Salsa, we continue to expand distribution and grow share with two new product lines; Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Herdez Salsa Cremosa. Recently, Herdez also entered the hot sauce market with the introduction of Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce, another versatile offering that can enhance any meal. The Wholly brand had a strong quarter as well as it continues to target consumers looking for convenience solutions to enjoy avocado offerings. Our recent innovations including Wholly Smashed, and Wholly Diced avocado products solve for that consumer need and as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter. Jennie-O volume decreased 3% and sales increased 2%, a recovery in the foodservice business and higher Hormel retail sales drove the sales increase. Foodservice volumes were up double-digits compared to last year. Demand for Jennie-O retail products such as lean ground turkey remained above pre-pandemic levels. Jennie-O turkey store segment profit declined 54% due to the impact from higher feed costs. Grain prices continue to increase significantly during the quarter, while pricing action had yet to be fully reflected in the marketplace. Jim Sheehan will provide further commentary on the actions we have taken to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. Looking into the balance of the year, we're increasing our full-year sales guidance range to $10.2 billion to $10.8 billion and reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of the Planters Snack Nut business. Our diversified and balanced business model gives us confidence. We can perform well in many different economic scenarios and market conditions. We have a very positive outlook on the foodservice business as we head into the second-half of the year. We're well-positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor partners and operators and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery. Additionally, we're increasingly confident that K-12 schools and colleges and universities will open and operate in a more traditional manner this fall. This should benefit both refrigerated foods and Jennie-O turkey store. We continue to see elevated demand in the retail deli and international channels. We expect to further benefit from pricing actions, increased capacities on key product lines, and continued improvements in our supply chain. This year, we have seen rapid increases in key input costs across our businesses and we expect to operate in a high cost environment for the remainder of the year. Our experienced management team has a proven ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile and inflationary market conditions and once again, we'll be leveraging our direct sales force to partner with our customers to mutually grow our businesses. As a reminder, our operations were heavily impacted by plant shutdowns, supply shortages and lower production throughput caused by the effects of the pandemic in the back half of fiscal 2020. This ultimately led to lower levels of inventory, which negatively affected the third and fourth quarters. Further strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our operations and based on our record first-half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized operations in the back half of fiscal 2021. I am confident in our ability to continue growing and I'm looking forward to closing the acquisition of Planters next month. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Snee to discuss our financial information relating to the quarter. Give update on our financial position and provide commentary regarding key input costs market. Jim Snee : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Record sales for the second quarter were $2.6 billion, an increase of 8%. First-half sales increased 5% to $5.1 billion, also a record. Pre-tax earnings increased 2% for the quarter, compared to last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.42 per share flat to last year. Second quarter results reflected approximately $0.01 per share in incremental COVID related costs and $0.01 in higher tax expense. SG&A excluding advertising was 6.5% of sales, down slightly to last year. Advertising spend for the quarter was $31 million. Operating margins for the quarter were 11.1%, compared to 12.1% last year. Higher raw material and feed costs negatively impacted margins, as pricing lagged input cost increases. We have taken numerous pricing actions across the portfolio to protect profitability. The actions will take place early in the third quarter with additional pricing actions likely. COVID related expenses were $6 million. The impact of COVID expenses continued to decline. Net unallocated expenses decreased due to higher investment income. The effective tax rates for the quarter were 22.1%, compared to 20.6% last year, excluding the impact from the Planters acquisition. We estimate the full-year tax rate to be between 20% and 21.5%. We built inventory during the quarter in preparation for higher demand and to support continued growth for the remainder of the year. Our strategic action to build inventory was the primary driver of lower operating cash flow during the quarter. We paid our 371st consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 17 at an annual rate of $0.98, a 5% increase over the prior year. Share repurchases were minimal during the quarter. Capital expenditures were $45 million in the quarter. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. During the second quarter, we saw dramatic increases in pork and hog prices. USDA composite cut-out prices since January have increased more than $30 with all primals contributing to the increase. Key inputs such as bellies and trim increased 57% and 76% respectively during the quarter. Pork exports also set an all-time record in March due to African swine fever outbreaks in China, Southeast Asia and Europe. We anticipate strengthened pork market due to continued export demand and a food service recovery domestically. USDA is now projecting pork production for the year to be slightly lower than 2020. Industry operating efficiencies are expected to improve as COVID pressures abate. However, labor availability, tighter hog supplies and reductions in the Herdez support higher markets. Our balanced approach to hog and pork procurement mitigated cost volatility during the quarter. In high costs and volatile environments, the strength of our leading brands and balanced approach to procurement continues to be a competitive advantage. The guidance range assumes elevated and volatile market conditions for the balance of the year with some moderation heading into the fall. We expect hog prices in the USDA composite cutouts remain well above year ago levels due to strong domestic and export demand along with tighter hog supplies. We anticipate prices to peak during the summer and go gradually decline in the fall, consistent with the seasonal increase in harvest. Belly prices are projected to remain higher than last year in historical averages. We anticipate markets to stabilize near the current levels of volatility due to local storage levels in strong demand in the foodservice channel could cause inflationary pressure. Pork trim prices are expected to moderate from the current levels, but labor shortages across the industry remains a key risk to trim prices as limited boning capacity directly impacts trim supply and pricing. Due to the higher beef harvest levels in the summer months beef prices are anticipated to be lower in the back-half of 2021. In response to global supply and demand imbalances in corn and soybean meal we have taken strategic hedges to fully cover grain costs for the remainder of the year. The positions also provide a benefit if markets decline. These hedges coupled with the previously announced pricing actions are expected to protect Jennie-O's profitability. Turkey poult placements and egg sets have declined. Inventory levels are lower compared to last year. The tightening of supply had led to higher whole turkey and thigh meat markets. We have also recently seen an increase in breast meat prices. A recovery in the foodservice industry remains the key driver for higher prices for this support market. We anticipate inflationary pressure on freight in the back-half of the year, but tactical action to optimize our distribution with two new DCs combined with improvements in load efficiencies will help mitigate a portion of the increase. We have attained the required regulatory approvals for the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business. The scheduled close date is in June. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Jim Snee : Morning, Peter. Peter Galbo : And Jim Sheehan, thank you for all of the commentary. Jim, I guess just thinking about the guide, and the move, and in sales relative to kind of keeping EPS flat. If we were to just take the midpoint sales guide, it kind of implies that you'll see a relatively decent acceleration in gross margins in the back-half of the year, something in the magnitude of 60 to 70 basis points kind of versus what you did in the front-half. A, I just wanted to see if that's kind of how directionally you're thinking about it. And just given all the headwinds you called out, understanding that the pricing actions are coming through, what would drive kind of that sequential improvement in gross margin? Jim Snee : Yes, good morning, Peter. Thanks for the question. I mean and really what we're talking about here is the timing, the volatility, the magnitude of the inflation that we're seeing. And so, that the pricing actions that we have taken didn't happen all right at the beginning of the second quarter. And quite frankly, we're not done with all the pricing actions that we need to take. So, we've got a lot of activity on that front. And so just the sequential action in our pricing is what will lead to that sequential improvement in margins. And so as you think about Q3, you'll see improvement, but probably some slightly lower margins as pricing hasn't quite caught up. Q4, really start to see more normalized margins as full pricing takes affect across the board. And I think it's important to note that we've either taken or will take price across almost all of our business. Peter Galbo : No, that's helpful. Maybe just to clarify there, Jim, on the third quarter, is that lower margins sequentially versus last year versus normal? And then just that the second question, as we think about Jennie-O, obviously you've locked in some of the feed cost for the remainder of the year. Jim Sheehan, I think you tossed out a 9% operating margin bogey as a target maybe for this year. Is that timeline kind of pushed out to '22 or '23 at this point? Thanks very much, guys. Jim Snee : Well, I'll start on Q3. And I think your -- the first question, is that's relative to last year, so slightly lower margins to last year just as pricing hasn't fully caught up. Jim Sheehan : Yes, I'll touch on the JOTS issue, Peter. First of all, as we talked about there, pricing is now in place to cover that first ramp up of grain costs. And as we talked, we protected the grain cost for the rest of the year. And it with also having downside protection on that, so we're 100% covered on grain. The other thing is that we talked about, is what's happening in the markets. When you think about Jennie-O, the fundamentals which we keep pointing towards over the last few years are better. Hog sets and -- or egg sets and poult placements are both down 3% to 4%. And you're starting to see that with the cold storage levels continue to be the 26% below the five-year average. What you're starting to see now is some nice improvements in the commodity markets around turkey. For instance, yesterday you saw breast meat at $2.11. That there are a lot of watch-outs for JOTS, but there's also a fair amount of upside. And we're starting to see that upside come through. We've launched these -- the fundamentals point towards better markets for probably a year now. They really haven't taken place, but they do seem to be taking place as we go forward. As far as the 9%, yes, these -- the drastic jump up in grain costs obviously delayed that. So, we look at the full-year margin of 9%, that's really been pushed out a bit. Peter Galbo : Got it, guys. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question today will come from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Hi, Adam. Jim Sheehan : Hi, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Jim Sheehan, maybe continuing on some of the JOTS questions there, and in your last response you referenced kind of a whole bunch of -- some positives, but a bunch of watch outs. Apart from grain cost, I'd love to hear kind of the key things that are still in your mind. Is it less reflective of demand growth and kind of your performance in retail, shelf penetration? Just what are you kind of focused on there besides the grain cost as the key watch out? Jim Sheehan : Well, I'll start with a little bit on the watch-outs, and I'll turn it over to Jim to talk about the performance. I think as you look at the inflation that we've seen recently and as you look forward, obviously you have the grain is impacting inflation. For that you've got the demand, though we know the demand is very solid. Weather conditions look pretty good; [indiscernible] seem to be maybe a little bit understated at the USDA. So, that looks okay, it looks good at this point. Obviously, in June, we'll have a better read of that. But as I would look at things, I think the other thing that's impacting inflation is labor availability. I mean getting people back into their jobs will, I think, alleviate some of the labor pressure. From a COVID standpoint we're in really good shape, but it's getting new hires, it's getting people back to the job that probably is a watch-out for me, not only of JOTS, but across the industry. Jim Snee : And Adam, I would say more from a business perspective, I think our retail business has performed well. Again, it's hard in a year-over-year environment, but if we go back to pre-pandemic, especially in our lean ground turkey, very, very strong performance, pleased with the distribution gains, household penetration, the velocities that we're seeing. From a foodservice perspective, they're a little bit more exposed with the K-12 business, the school business, which obviously didn't come back in full strength. We do expect to see that in the fall, and then spillover into 2022. So, as we think about it from a retail and foodservice perspective, there is optimism on the business front. Adam Samuelson : All right, that color is really helpful. And then my second question was really just thinking about trajectory of foodservice as we go into the back-half of the year, you kind of gave some color where the second quarter was up versus '19 levels. How do you think the industry performed or I guess the relevant categories for you on a similar metric? And just areas where you think you're maybe gaining some outside share that's giving you some optimism? Jim Snee : Yes, I mean I think it's fair to say in a really broad base, we outperformed the industry here in the second quarter. And that's not new, right. I mean as even pre-pandemic, we talked about our foodservice business typically growing at double the industry rate. And so, we're confident that we've outgrown or grown faster than the industry. For us where we see future opportunities in a number of our segments, we haven't seen lodging come back. We really haven't seen college and university fully come back, which is a big part of our Hormel Foodservice business. I referenced K-12 for the Jennie-O Foodservice business. So, there's still a lot of dynamics at play. And so even as these other segments, these other channels really start to reopen, those are going to have a favorable impact on our foodservice business as well. Adam Samuelson : I really appreciate that color. I'll pass it on, thanks. Jim Snee : Thank you. Operator : The next question today will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I guess just given what we saw in Q2 foodservice now above where you were in 2019, groceries still very strong. So if you exit the pandemic, I mean, do you guys think now that you'll have a much higher foodservice and grocery business going forward? Jim Snee : I think, Rupesh, we've always felt very confident in all of our business obviously we've talked a lot about the strength of our business in particular in the center of the store. And so we think it will continue to be strong post-pandemic, you're going to have some moving parts and some volatility in year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter. But I believe, once things settle down, we'll see our continued strength in center of the store grocery business, continued strength in our refrigerated retail business and then we've always talked about our real competitive advantage in the foodservice space. And I think that's playing out right now. It'll continue to play out this year and into the future. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe one follow-up question. So as you look at grocery products, I'm curious how you guys are thinking about that segment for the balance of the year. And then as sales trends have turned negative for other players as well, how would you characterize the current promotional backdrop? Jim Snee : Yes, the biggest driver for us right now, Rupesh is getting some of those Tier-2 and Tier-3 items back on shelf. And that's really what retailers need as we want to provide more promotional activity in the back half of the year and into '22. You can't just have one variety and have a promotion. So as our supply chain has recovered, and we've been able to focus on those varieties, we're seeing retailers being a lot more willing to engage in promotional discussions, which will be very, very helpful for the business in the balance of '21 into '22. Jim Sheehan : The only thing I'd add to that Rupesh is that remember our fourth quarter in GT was significantly constrained by capacity issues in our operations. Rupesh Parikh : Great, thank you for the color. I'll pass it on. Operator : The next question will come from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Hi, thanks for the question. Jim Snee : Hi, Tom. Tom Palmer : You mentioned on the earnings call that more price was expected to flow through in the second-half of the year; price mix of 11% this quarter, highest in years. I know you typically don't provide this, but just given the magnitude of the price mix figure, could you help us in detail on how much mix really contributed to that number in the second quarter? And then how much maybe pricing we should expect to really ramp as we look at the second-half of the year? I mean, you're putting up a little bit now. I mean throwing 5% on top of that or some sizable number? Jim Sheehan : Yes, I think it's a great question, Tom. As we think about our business, and that price mix, I mean, really a key driver in the second quarter was our foodservice business, which tends to track markets more closely than the retail business. We did have some impact of retail pricing in the quarter. But again, it wasn't for the entire quarter. But the big driver in the quarter was foodservice. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. And then in the prepared remarks, Jim Sheehan you noted the magnitude of hog and pork price increases, last year saw some weaker hog pricing, you called out hedging losses. I know there'll be more color in the 10-Q but just any detail on hedging this quarter, such as maybe gains that flow through? Jim Sheehan : Sure, Tom. I appreciate the question. Remember our accounting method is one that we do not mark-to-market our positions, but we run them through the cost of goods at the time the product is sold. So as you look at our -- the realized gains and losses are in the quarter, the unrealized are in other comprehensive income. And those will be in $45 million range of unrealized gains and losses and that would be for hogs, grain and our interest positions. Tom Palmer : Okay, thanks. Thanks for that detail, just to confirm not a factor this quarter it would recognize that? Jim Sheehan : It didn't give us much help this quarter. It was a pretty immaterial amount. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, I guess a couple of clarity questions. Just on that Jim, the $45 million, I guess those are hedging gains. So those will flow through at a positive way to your P&L as you sell the product. But it's also -- there's also higher input costs flowing through wall. So they're kind of fighting against each other for the next couple of quarters. Is that\u2026 Jim Snee : Yes, I mean the unrealized gains or gains based on the market that close what would be a factor. Now we also, as I stated before, we also have our interest hedges in there, too. So those are more related to the debt that we will be issuing and have a longer tail that obviously the grain or the hog markets. So it's a mixture. Robert Moskow : Okay, I'll follow-up on that. Regarding the 6% pricing in grocery in the quarter, can you give a little color on what kind of product lines you raise the pricing on? Is that going to accelerate as well? Or is that kind of like a new normal for a while, because of actions you took in March? Jim Sheehan : Yes, frank that the biggest driver to the pricing in the front part of the year, Rob was the SKIPPY price increase that we took earlier in the year. In GP, I mean, we still have additional pricing action to come, whether it's SPAM, or Herdez, I mean the number of different GP items. So we did have some in the first-half, but there's still more to come in the back half of the year. Robert Moskow : Okay. That's my questions. Thanks. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to go back to the share gains, kind of broadly, and maybe try to understand a little bit the landscape at a high level, I guess, just looking at ten year foodservice growth versus 2019, and the strong retail growth versus 2019. Assuming people aren't just eating more -- there's clearly some momentum there that is coming from somewhere. And I suppose there's a chance there's maybe a permanent reset of pantry inventory, but even that probably a small. So can you just give a sense of, who you're gaining share from? Are there smaller competitors that have suppliers that have gone out of business? Or just how do you kind of understand how you're sourcing your share gains? Jim Snee : Yes, I mean, it's a mix, again, depending on which category you're talking about. I mean, in some cases, we are in line with categories. So whether you think Bacon, or SPAM or peanut butter, I think we've seen some outpacing in some of our meal offerings, as you mentioned, I think we've seen it in our Mexican portfolio, which really is taking that net share from competitors. So I think as you go across the portfolio, Michael, it really is a mixed bag of where those share gains are coming from. Michael Lavery : Okay, thanks. And just following-up on the foodservice piece, you called out the boosted gave, partly from the past through pricing there. Can you give us a sense of how much pricing is passed through in your portfolio versus just what requires a less increase? Jim Snee : Oh, I mean, the majority of the foodservice business is I'll call it off a traditional priceless. So that gets adjusted on a weekly basis and we tend to see that pricing reflected in -- we've always said within 30 days. So a significant portion of our business is still done that way. We do have some other pricing arrangements, obviously with larger national accounts. But just think about it where the majority -- more than the majority of the business is on a paster basis. Michael Lavery : And on the retail side? Jim Snee : Well, I mean, we've always said that, more of a 90-day price action in terms of having the discussion with the customer getting accepted, and then getting it implemented. Really the only difference there would be retail fresh pork, which I mean, does play a role and still has a significant part of our portfolio. But it's that is priced on a weekly basis. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will come from Eric Larson with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So the first question is, and I think, Kim Sheehan kind of refer to some of this. But can you talk a little bit about, hog supplies, we're not going to see a huge increase in production this year, these high grain prices probably are disincentive yet we have. Hog prices, live prices well over $100, 100-weight right now. Supply constraints on your biggest raw material, is that a possibility going forward here and it looks like grain prices could be high for a while. So how do you look at maybe the next couple of years, just not just this year, but maybe next in terms of hog production in the U.S.? And what are farmers doing out there? Jim Snee : Well, as we've talked about in the past, Eric, we do long-term contracts with our producers. And as you're aware, these producers are large operators with a high level of capital and tend to keep their barns filled. We also get a large portion of our production from a contracted facility, the three-month facility, which is made up of producers; they tend to like to keep their own plants full. So, I'm very confident that we'll have the supply that we need both short-term and long-term. When we go through these cycles all the time, it hard prices have increased rapidly. The prices have gone up a lot. You're right; grain prices are high right now. We'll see other growing season what results are from the growing season to see what impact it has on prices. But these are long-term agreements, and we're not having anybody get into negotiations about taking down their volume. So I'm highly confident. Eric Larson : Okay, then my follow-up question is on your supply chain conversion, and all your efforts that you've done on that it was to Ben, quite remarkable. And I think we even alluded to the benefits of your improved supply chain in your -- in the press release. But I believe if we go back, I think, at one point, you said that supply chain was going to have this number incorrect. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but about $75 million of supply chain cost benefits. But that was a while back? Can you give us a quick update on how the supply chain is helping you here? And it's got to be helping your cost structure. And then obviously, it keeps you from having to price too aggressively as well. So can you share that dynamic with us? And give us a little update there? Jim Snee : Sure. It's a great question, Eric. And we have spent a lot of time and effort over the last three plus years, putting together our one supply chain. And it's really been our initiative to take this fragmented approach throughout the supply chain and really capitalize on the efficiencies and take cost out. And so, we've done a lot of great work in our operations. In our logistics, as we mentioned are some of the warehousing initiatives that we still had going on. And you're right, probably the first two years of supply chain and even going into the pre-pandemic we talked about our ability to have cost savings of $75 million. Last year, obviously, was a bit of a disruption. But that didn't stop the good work that was happening behind the scenes. And I think you'll see that play through when we talk about our ability to open up new warehouses to help mitigate some of the cost pressure on GP and now on our refrigerated portfolio. And the other thing is for me personally I can't imagine us having gone through the pandemic with a fragmented supply chain. Having one voice from the top setting directions and making sure that the entire team was aligned was very, very powerful and necessary for the organization. So, I mean the benefits to the organization has far weighted the financial returns. And, we are in a significantly better place today as a result of our efforts on one supply chain. Eric Larson : Okay, great. Thanks. And have a great Memorial holiday. Jim Snee : Yes, thank you. You too, Eric. Operator : The next question will come from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Please go ahead. Pooran Sharma : Hi, good morning. This is Pooran on for Ben. I just had a one quick question. What has the ramp in food service sales and corresponding capacity utilization improvement contributed to margin? Jim Snee : Oh, yes, I mean I think obviously they go hand in hand. And we've talked about some -- coming out of or I should say in the midst of the pandemic the underutilized capacity which of course led to some of our increased COVID cost. So, there has been a benefit. But really the big driver and the way you should think about the food service business is the volume that we have been able to drive in the marketplace. And really it's the really reopening, the re-engagement with distributors and operators. And then I mentioned earlier with a number of different segments that really haven't open yet or hit their stride. So, not only we feel good about where we are today but the opportunities that are yet to come. Pooran Sharma : Great, great. And may be if I could just squeeze one more in? Jim Snee : Yes, go ahead. Pooran Sharma : Just regarding your price increases, do you think that you will be able to hang on to some of these increases after this period of cost inflation abates? And maybe you can just help us think through what will be easier versus harder to achieve? Jim Snee : Yes, that's a great question. And it's something that we talk about a lot because nobody likes to be in the midst of the inflationary period with all the market volatility. But it's not new to us, right? I mean we've managed through multiple inflationary periods over the course of our business. And our management team, our leadership has a well-established plan for how we take pricing, how we appropriately promote, and really to your point about how we work hard to maintain that pricing over time. So, yes, we do believe that we'll be able to do that as we've demonstrated in the past. Pooran Sharma : Great, thank you for clearing the questions. That's it from me. Jim Snee : Yes, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Antonio Hernandez with Barclays. Please go ahead. Antonio Hernandez : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. [Indiscernible] international segment sales were very good with margins [indiscernible] could you give us a little more guidance in what you see there [indiscernible] from expenses and cost point of view in the international segment and your domestic segment? Thanks. Jim Sheehan : Yes, I would say the big issue -- the big difference between the international and domestic right now is the whole ocean freight issue including containers that's creating some additional cost in the system. Freight, we have been able -- freight is up a little bit. Domestically, we have been able to manage that as we've improved our supply chain. But ocean containers freight availability goes back to this issue around labor that's created some not only higher cost but also some shipping interruption. And I think that's probably going to last for the rest of the year. Jim Snee : Yes. The optimism that we have in our international segment I mean it is broad based. But certainly with the high level of focus on the continued growth and the continued success that we are seeing in China from both our retail and food service businesses and I mentioned it in my remarks, but we are really excited about the performance of SPAM, how we've been able to really gain distribution and the acceptance of that brand, and how we are launching innovative new flavors. The SKIPPY business continues to be very, very strong, non-traditional innovation with our Hormel Beef Jerky. And so, we continue to expect growth coming out of that business and across all areas, other multinational exports and partnerships. Antonio Hernandez : Okay, thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Yes. Well, thank you all for joining us today. Our strong performance this quarter once again demonstrates the resilience of our entire team and the strength of our balance portfolio. We know that we still have work to do for the balance of the year, but we remain very optimistic about the future, and we look forward to bringing the Planters business, and the Planters team on Board in June. Thanks again for joining us. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

Jim Snee : Thank you, Nathan. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our team delivered the highest quarterly sales in the Company's 130-year history, while operating in an environment, which included inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply chain challenges. Our ability to deliver this performance demonstrates the strength of our balanced business model and a strong consumer demand as we grew sales in all 4 segments and all 4 sales channels on an organic basis. Also in the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Planters Snack Nuts business. This brand fits perfectly into our vision for Hormel Foods and is another step in our strategic evolution. The integration has been smooth, which has allowed us to effectively operate the business with no disruptions. Each accomplishments were achieved by our team members who never lost sight of our long-term growth strategy in the face of unprecedented industry-wide challenges. To all our team members around the world, including our new Planters team members, thank you for your accomplishments, and thank you for staying safe. Now, more than ever, our investments across all areas of our business are paying off and have allowed us to reach even more consumers when and where they are eating. Whether it is cooking a meal at home, snacking at work, eating at a local restaurant, hosting a gathering with family and friends, or ordering food online, a Hormel Foods branded product will likely be an option. The proof is in our performance this quarter. Sales increased 20% on a volume increase of 1%. Compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 25%. This all-time record performance was led by an acceleration in our foodservice business, sustained demand for our retail and deli products, continued growth from our international business and pricing actions taken across the portfolio. Excluding a partial quarter of the Planters business, organic sales increased 14% and volume declined 2%. For the quarter, we saw an acceleration in our foodservice business as sales grew 45% compared to last year. What is even more impressive is sales increased 17% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels Our enterprise foodservice portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the most pressing need of today's foodservice operators, which is labor. Our products minimize labor, simplify food preparation, and save time. All while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to their menus. Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon Wholly Guacamole, Fontanini, authentic Italian sausages and Hormel Fire Braised meat are all excellent examples of products that are succeeding in today's environment. Our retail business also showed 9% growth compared to 2020. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, this business delivered outstanding growth of 31%. Brands such as SPAM, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Jennie-O, and [Indiscernible] continue to resonate with consumers. Sales on the daily channel increased 12% this quarter and are up 16% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Hormel Gatherings, Party Trays, and Columbus chart coterie items showed another quarter of growth as consumers returned to entertaining and spending time with family and friends. An important component of our growth in retail and deli is our e-commerce performance. We continue to invest in the digital space and we are seeing strong results compared to pre-pandemic levels. Our international channel delivered impressive growth of 36% compared to 2020 and is 33% above 2019 levels. Improvement was led by branded exports and strength from the multinational businesses in China and Brazil. Again, I cannot stress enough how proud I am of our entire team for delivering these impressive results in the midst of an incredibly difficult operating environment marked by significant inflation, labor challenges, and supply chain disruptions. This not only demonstrates the team's ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, but also reinforces the power of our brands. On a consolidated basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.32, a 14% decline compared to 2020. The decrease was due to one-time transaction costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of the Planters business. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, a 5% increase. Our team did an excellent job actively managing through inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. During the quarter, we continue to see inflation in labor rates, freight, supplies, raw materials, and many other inputs with an acceleration compared to the second quarter. Of note, we saw a very high level of inflation in port input costs. To mitigate this inflationary pressure, we have taken pricing on almost every brand and product across our Company. This is a testament to our successful pricing strategy, the power of our brands, and the hard work of our entire team, especially our direct sales force. As a reminder, there is a difference in how quickly pricing flows through by channel, and this can shift profits to later quarters. We have a track record of improving profitability through a market cycle, and we expect margins to improve in the coming quarters. We also saw a drastic step-up in industry-wide operational challenges caused by labor shortages. This has impacted both our facilities and the operations of supplier and logistic partners. This has created a very complex operating environment, which led to an inability to fully meet customer demand. To address labor availability in our facilities, we are taking swift actions to hire and retain team members, implement automation across manufacturing facilities, and simplify the portfolio. Our entire team, from operations to our direct sales force has done an excellent job adjusting, prioritizing, and managing through this dynamic environment. Turning to the segments, refrigerated foods volume decreased 2%, sales increased 19%, and segment profit was flat. Organic volume decreased 3% and organic sales increased 18%. Volume was lower due to lower harvest levels and commodity sales compared to last year. Our foodservice business accelerated compared to the second quarter with elevated levels of demand for all our branded products. Nearly every category grew volume and sales compared to last year, with standout performances from products like Hormel Bacon 1, Pizza Toppings, and sliced meats. Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Fontanini, Applegate, and Pizza Toppings were just some of the items that also grew volume and sales compared to 2019. Similar to prior quarters, we saw excellent growth from premium prepared proteins, which are the cornerstone of our pre -strategy, offering versatile and flavorful items that come pre -marinated, pre-sliced or pre-cooked. These items solve for the most pressing issues facing operators today labor shortages. Brands like Bacon 1, Austin Blues, Fire Braised, and Cafe H are designed to solve for this challenge and have never been as important or in higher demand than they are today. We saw momentum continue for our retail and deli brands and refrigerated foods as well. Product showing exceptional sales growth include Hormel Gatherings Party Trays, Hormel Black Label Bacon, Hormel Fully Cooked Entrees, and Lutz's BBQ. The Columbus brand has shown no signs of slowing down as consumers look for premium authentic charcuterie. I'm pleased with the performance of our new charcuterie plant in Omaha as the team is quickly filling up the new production lines. We are excited about the upcoming holiday season and expect a high level of demand for our innovative and premium Columbus product lines. International delivered it's 6xth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with volume up 2%, sales up 26%, and segment profit up 18%. Organic volume increased 1% and organic sales increased 24%. Total branded and fresh pork exports grew during the quarter. We continue to see strong growth from SPAM, SKIPPY, and many food service brands around the world. Our business in China continues to perform well, led by foodservice and from retail brands such as SPAM and SKIPPY. Our new item launches the Beef Jerky and SKIPPY snacking items have also been very successful. Grocery products volume increased 4%, sales increased 20%, and segment profit increased 1%. Brands including SPAM, Hormel Completes, and Wholly showed excellent growth during the quarter. We continue to see strong growth relative to 2019 pre-pandemic levels for brands such as SPAM, Hormel Completes, Dinty Moore, Mary Kitchen, and Herdez. Organic volume decreased 6%, and organic sales were flat. Organic volumes faced difficult comparisons due to the extremely high levels of demand during the early parts of the pandemic. Additionally, we have rationalized capacity on numerous contract manufacturing items to support growth of our branded business. Our MegaMex joint venture delivered excellent results as equity and earnings increased 30%. The growth from the Herdez and Wholly brands are being driven by the tremendous level of innovation from MegaMex with products such as Herdez, [Indiscernible], Herdez Guacamole salsa, and Wholly Smashed Avocado. We're also extremely encouraged by our entry into the hot sauce space with the Herdez Avocado hot sauce. Jennie-O volume increased 9%, and sales increased 22%. A combination of a food-service recovery and higher whole bird and commodity volumes drove the volume increase. Increased sales is due to higher volumes and pricing actions across the portfolio. Jennie-O Turkey store segment profit declined 17% driven by the impact from significantly higher feed and freight costs. While spot grain markets remained elevated during the quarter, the hedging actions we took stabilized the cost increases. Looking to the balance of the year, we issued our full-year net sales and earnings guidance to reflect the Planters acquisition. We expect net sales to be between $11 billion to $11.2 billion. And for diluted earnings per share to be between a $1.65 to a $1.69. This guidance reflects the addition of the Planters business and includes the associated one-time transaction costs and accounting adjustments, in addition to the impact from inflationary pressures on our business. We expect a strong finish to the year as pricing actions continue to take effect, the foodservice industry continues to recover, and from the addition of Planters. Looking beyond the fourth quarter, I feel very optimistic about the future. Our balance portfolio with diversification across raw materials, channels and categories will allow us to perform well in many economic environments. Further, we never wavered on our commitment to employee safety and on making disciplined and strategic investments to ensure we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. At the onset of the pandemic, we have made the following strategic investments. We opened a new Columbus short coterie plant in Omaha, and we immediately invested in Phase 2 representing a major expansion of our pepperoni capacity. We completed the Pizza Toppings expansion at our Burke plant in Iowa, which significantly increased our capacity for Pizza Toppings. We have invested in R&D for plant-based products. And launched our plant-based pepperoni and sausage crumble items at the Pizza Expo in mid-August. Additionally, we bolstered our innovation efforts by investing in new R&D centers, both domestically and in China. We expanded our distribution network for both the shelf-stable and refrigerated businesses. We made further progress on building out our one supply chain by investing in systems, people, and processes. We acquired Sadler's Smokehouse, which added capacity to support growth during the recovery in the foodservice industry. We completed the HR and finance portions of Project Orion and continue to work towards the multi-phase implementation of our supply chain. We continue to make investments in advertising for our leading brands. And finally, we made the Company's largest investment ever, the acquisition of Planters. We are already seeing the benefits that a large, iconic, and well-known brand can have on our business. These are just some of the many investments we have made to further enhance our business and set us up for growth into the future. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss financial information relating to the quarter. Give an update on our financial position, and provide commentary regarding key input cost markets. Jim Sheehan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Third-quarter sales were $2.9 billion, an all-time record for the Company. Net sales and organic net sales increased 20% and 14% respectively, compared to last year. Segment profit increased 2% for the quarter, driven by strong results in the international segment, foodservice growth and the addition of Planters. Earnings per share were up $0.32. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding one-time costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition Planters was $0.39, a 5% increase. COVID -related expenses during the quarter were immaterial. Adjusted SG&A was 6.9% of sales compared to 7.6% last year. Advertising for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of 25%. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 8.7%, a decrease from 10.5% last year. We expect margins to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter as the impact of pricing actions continue to take effect. Net unallocated expenses increased as a result of the onetime acquisition-related costs for Planters and net interest expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.3%. The primary driver of the decline was a large volume of stock options exercised during the quarter and a one-time foreign tax benefit. The revised guidance range assumes a full-year tax rate between 19% and 20.5%. Operating cash flow declined compared to last year, impacted by working capital from the Planters acquisition and higher levels of inventory. Inventory levels were unseasonably low last year during the third quarter. We paid our 372nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 16th at an annual rate of $0.98 per share, a 5% increase over 2020. This completes the 93rd consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend payments. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter. The Company's target for the capital expenditures in 2021 is 260 million. The Planters acquisition represents a change to the Company's capital structure. In June, we issued $2.3 billion of notes in 3, 7 and 30-year tranches. This debt was incremental to the $1 billion of 10-year notes we issued in 2020. Including the treasury locks, the weighted average cost of debt is 1.6% and the weighted average maturity is 10.4 years. This attractive debt profile is an ideal balance for our business. We will continue to use a disciplined waterfall approach to capital allocation, which includes 3 areas, required, strategic, and opportunistic uses of cash. I expect no changes to dividend growth or our CapEx strategy. We are committed to an investment-grade rating and plan to deleverage to 1.5 to 2 times debt to EBITDA over the next 2 to 3 years. The business experienced significant inflationary pressures on pork input costs during the quarter. The dramatic increase in pork and hog prices continued in the third quarter. Hog prices were up 250% compared to 20-year lows last year. Additionally, the prices of pork remained elevated caused by the recovery in the foodservice and the strong worldwide demand. The USDA composite cutout was up 50% compared to last year, and 20% compared to the second quarter. Driven belly prices also experienced inflationary pressure with significant volatility. Compared to the prior year, belly prices were 62% higher and trim prices were 27% higher. The business benefited from the balanced approach to hog and pork procurement, as we purchased hogs in aggregate at prices lower than the market. However, the rate of the drastic rise in the total pork input costs negatively impacted profitability. The latest estimates from the USDA indicate pork production for the year to decrease 2% compared to 2020. Lower harvest levels, lighter carcass weights, and labor shortages across the industry, support higher markets [Indiscernible]. We're closely monitoring the discovery of African swine fever in the Caribbean and labor availability across the industry. Both factors could impact input cost going forward. Fundamentals in the turkey industry improved during the third quarter. Higher prices for commodity items, including breastfeed, size, and whole turkeys were a benefit to the quarter. Additionally, egg sets and pulp placements declined. Cold storage remain significantly below historical averages. Higher operating costs offset the market benefits. Inflationary pressure on corn and soybean meal have resulted in substantially higher feed cost. The strategic hedges on corn and soybean meal have stabilized feed cost. We also absorbed higher costs for freight, packaging, supplies, and labor. We are actively managing our logistics network and supplier partnerships to minimize cost increases. Across the portfolio, pricing actions were effective, but from a timing standpoint, trailed inflation during the quarter. We expect to recover lost profitability due to inflation in the coming quarters, as conditions normalize and pricing actions expand. The strong demand for our key products during the price increases is a testament to the strength of our leading brands. The guidance issued for the remainder of the year includes the impact of Planters and the expectations of continued inflationary pressure and volatile market conditions. Although the third quarter had its challenges and also included significant financial milestones. We closed the largest acquisition in the Company's history. We financed the transaction by leveraging the balance sheet through an attractive debt structure in both interest rates and tenor. All while maintaining our investment-grade rating. We move into the future with a more efficient capital structure, stronger brands, and continued financial strength to invest in our business. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the Operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Good morning. Thank you. Jim Snee : Morning. Michael Lavery : Can you just elaborate on your pricing a bit and give us sense -- I don't know, you said it's broad and maybe literally every brand and product, but maybe, one, just some of the order of magnitude and how you determined kind of what was appropriate. And if it might be enough or you think this coverage you for -- well into next year as well as obviously finishing this one. Jim Snee : Good morning, Michael. That's a really complex question. And you hit it right on the head when you say, and we've said it, that the pricing is very, very broad-based across the portfolio. And, I think, for us, what we have been watching throughout the second quarter and the third quarter is just to be prepared and making sure that as we're watching, not only commodity markets, but packaging costs and freight rates, is making sure that we're capturing those in that timeframe. And what's been different in this environment is obviously those costs have just continued to move away from us.  And no different than any other food Company that you're talking to. What I do think is different though, is that we have been ready. We have taken broad-based aggressive pricing, but we've continued to have to do that and we will continue to have to do that as we've seen these markets and costs continued to move away from us. So again, it's really broad-based. It could vary by product, by categories. Clearly, we're watching all of the category dynamics. We're watching what's happening with the elasticities within our brands and categories.  And so it's obviously a very complex dynamic. But the key takeaway though, is that we're really pleased with the pricing actions that we've taken, we're pleased with the brand performances, and we know that we're ready to react with some additional pricing going forward. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just to clarify, what we see from this report in the third quarter, would that pretty fully reflect the pricing, or was it really just getting underway so that we should expect it to accelerate? Jim Snee : Well, I mean, again, depends on brand and category, but we've got, as you can tell, a significant pricing that took place in the quarter. Some of that will carry over into the fourth quarter, but we also have pricing that is being prepared to go into effect that will take effect in the fourth quarter as well. So it's really going to be a combination of spillover from Q3 into Q4, and then some new pricing actions in Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens, please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jim Snee : Morning Jim Sheehan : Morning. Ben Bienvenu : So I want to ask -- so in the adjusted results, it looks like the implied impact from Planters is about $0.07 per share. That's towards the higher end of what you've said the impact would be for the full year to Planters when you provided guidance last time on the deal. Can you give us some color on what you think the full year -- for the balance of this year net impact of Planters is that's implied in your guidance, so we can get some clarity on kind of the core business? Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Ben. The $0.07 that you're referencing is only related to those one-time events related to the transaction, so the closing costs and those accounting adjustments that were made. There\u2019re obviously some transitional expenses as we bring this business online. That always occur with any type of business transfer. So those are -- those are included. We still believe that the 2 to $0.07 dilution in 2021 is reasonable. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Great. And then if I think about the -- I want to focus on the grocery products business. But if I think about the margin recovery of the business, you talked about taking price, working to take costs out of the system, drive efficiencies. Can you give us some sense of pace of recovery, obviously, implied in the fourth quarter, we're seeing meaningful margin improvement sequentially from the third quarter? But to the extent, you could delineate between grocery products and the relative segment's contribution to that improvement in margin sequentially and the trajectory from here that you see based on the current market outlook, that would be really helpful. Jim Snee : Sure, Ben. We could do that for you. I mean, I think the first thing to start with is the grocery products portfolio. Probably more than any other part of our business has the longest lag in pricing. And so, you'll see, we always say on average, 60 to 90 days in terms of how that pricing passes through. And for us, I mean, we've taken pricing across that entire portfolio, and you think about 72 pork trim and how that has been through the roof. And so we've been very aggressive, we've been ready to take additional price actions and so we've got a mix, just like I said earlier, we've got a mix that have taken effect in Q3. And we'll have a bigger impact in Q4. We have another round that'll be coming in Q4 that will really have the impact in Q1 of 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Tom Palmer, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Hi, thanks for the question. Jim Snee : Hi, Tom. Tom Palmer : Maybe just circling back to Planters, you noted about 40 million nonrecurring charges in the third quarter. Your guidance is on a GAAP basis, so it includes these charges. And then, as we look at the fourth quarter, what's embedded for either charges or credits related to that Planters business? I mean, are there going to be additional non-recurring considerations, or is 40 million the extent and it's pretty clean going forward? Jim Sheehan : Well, I think that you've seen the expenses related to the transaction are included in the 40 million, and some accounting adjustments are included in the 40 million. But until you complete your purchase accounting and make all of the accounting adjustments, which we think will be probably finished at the end of the fourth quarter, you can't say that all of the adjustments have taken place. So we believe that this is the majority of the expenses, the vast majority of the expenses, but they're still could be some one-time expenses come through as we close the purchase accounting process. Does that help you? Tom Palmer : Just to clarify, is anything embedded in that guidance number or it would be incremental at this point? Jim Sheehan : That is an all-in number. So that is a GAAP number that we are basing on what we believe is the performance of Planters and we're pleased with the transition into Planters. We've been pleased with the sales rate at this time period. The expenses that are called out and then those transactional or transitional expenses that occur anytime that you're bringing business into your organization. So that is an all-in number. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Thank you very much. Good morning, Jim and Jim. Just wanted to go back to the price increases and you've talked about, obviously, you've done something in Q3. You expect more to do in coming quarters. On the very initial ones, have you seen some sort of the reaction from consumers and customers and in terms of sensitivity to the price increases? And how has that been offset by the brand strength for some of your core plans where you've introduced those price increases. Jim Snee : Really -- we've been really pleased with the performance of all the businesses in the face of the price increases. The elasticity models that we typically use, we're outperforming those. And so we'll continue to watch the brands, the categories, the elasticities going forward. But I think the last point in your question is the really important one, and one that we highlighted in our comments, is that the brand strength that we have, that we've invested in, in sales over time is more important than it's ever been. As we're faced with such an inflationary environment and making sure that consumers have brands that they recognize and that resonate with them on a day-to-day basis is really, in our mind, is one of the key drivers of our success for the sales growth. Ben Theurer : Thank you. And then, on Planters, there's things been talked about and that's about how clean the fourth quarter is going to be. But if we look into fiscal 2022, would you feel comfortable reiterating your initial guidance of accretion and that high teens range for Planters? Jim Snee : Yes. At this point, then we would -- I mean, it is early. We've got what? Maybe 8 or 9 weeks that we own the business in the third quarter. But we're very satisfied with the sales performance. Many of the assumptions that we've made in other parts of the business are all holding up. We said we've already seen some of the benefits out an iconic brand like that can have on our business, we're experiencing that in the convenience channel. So, yes, at this point, although it's early, we still feel very comfortable with that range. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I guess just on your foodservice business, just given that we are seeing COVID cases spiking a number of markets, just curious if you've started to see any impact within that business. Jim Snee : And we have not, Rupesh. I mean, honestly, our foodservice business just continues to accelerate. And it really goes back to the challenge that these foodservice operators are pacing and its labor, right? And so as you think about how they have to compensate for that shortage of labor, our portfolio perfectly aligns with what they need to get caught. And so we're helping those operators overcome those challenges for doing it with our direct selling force, which we've said is a competitive advantage.  And again, more than ever, it is a distinct competency of this organization. So we haven't seen the foodservice business slow at all. We're seeing it accelerating and we feel incredibly bullish on our portfolio and what we are going to be able to achieve going forward. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe this one follow-up question. And I'm not sure how much you are going to share, but as we look at 2022, is there any way you can share some of the buildings blocks as you see them right now for next fiscal year? I mean, clearly, Planters it sounds like that [Indiscernible] accretion is still something that's in the range of possibilities, but just wondering if there's any other initial puts and takes, you'd be willing to share as we look out to the next fiscal year? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, it's a great question. I'm going to quantify it -- or qualify it by saying it's early. But what we just talked about, our foodservice strength, I mean, we expect labor to continue to be an incredible pinpoint for foodservice operators. But our portfolio is going to help us overcome that and we're going to help -- continue to help those foodservice operators. We do think that some of the additional capacity that we have coming online in early '22 for our pepperoni business expansion, and our bacon business is going to serve as well. You mentioned the impact of our Planters business, and we've had a great run with our MegaMex business, the authentic Mexican portfolio, not only the base business but the innovation that we're generating. We would expect some continued international strength as well. And then, as we talked earlier, the impact from pricing actions will also come into play. And that's all the good news. The offset to that will be what happens with inflation, what happens with labor that will impact our business in our manufacturing facilities. So there's a lot of unknowns on that side. But I think we feel really good about how we've built this portfolio and how we've built the business for the long term. And we're optimistic about 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning, guys. Jim Snee : Hi, Ken. Jim Sheehan : Morning, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Can you let us know, is supply chain challenges bigger or smaller than the inflationary pressure that you're feeling, and what are you doing to change the supply chain challenges? And when will they be mitigated? Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Ken. Good question. The inflation is one, as we look at our gross margin change, we certainly have had inflationary pressure. But when we look at our pricing action, our improved mix, and some efficiencies we've brought online, we have really offsetting that inflation. The pressure on the gross margin really relates to the labor shortages. Not only labor shortages at our facilities, but labor shortages throughout the supply chain. At times, we've had lines that have not been running at full capacity, that has strained us some overheads because we've had shortages in our plants, and other times, we've been notified, let's say relatively late, that our suppliers cannot provide us either packaging or input into our products. So as we look at the third quarter, as we look forward, really inflation, we think we've managed very well. It's this labor issue that is creating the pressure right now. So I'd say it's more of a labor issue. Jim Snee : And Can I -- I would just -- just to add on to that, I mean, really the key in all of this is, like you said, what are you doing about it? And there is, as you know, strong linkage between the labor and inflationary issues. So labor is costing us. The labor that we have is costing us a lot more. Then you have to deal with the [Indiscernible] labor. So we're pricing for the increased labor. For the labor that we don't have, clearly, we're raising starting wages. We're being more aggressive in how were finding employee pools to hire. We have to be more aggressive and more disciplined in how we are retaining our employees or finding ways to automate.  That doesn't happen overnight, but I would tell you that we've had successes in automation when we think about packaged placement, palletizing, and how we can pivot and reallocate those team members to more important manufacturing responsibilities. And then, through it all, it's how do we simplify our operations. And so, all of those things go hand in hand. And the one thing that this team has been able to do is not find themselves in a victim mentality, but really say, what are we going to do about it? Because that's really our challenge. Ken Zaslow : Great. I'm not a big fan of my next question, but I have to ask it just because you have to think about it this way. Which division do you think will be able to have margins at least on par with year-ago levels first? And then how does that progress for the other divisions? I know that dollars going to the bank is more important, but I'm just trying to figure it out just because obviously the sales are distorted by pricing and I'm just trying to figure out which divisions does a margin catch up? Which is the first margin, which are the first divisions, and then how long will it take? Just kind of framing that and I appreciate it. Jim Snee : Sure. I -- it is -- and I hate to give this answer, but I'm going to, is it really depends. And we think our Grocery Products division, as we've seen some moderation in raw materials has a really good opportunity to return to a more normalized margin structure also and it's a subset, but foodservice, obviously, within Refrigerated Foods, not only through the growth of the business but also the mix shift is really going to provide margin enhancement for us over time. So again, not a big fan of the answer, but I've got to give that. Jim Sheehan : Ken, the one thing that I would point you to is that, it's early in the quarter, but we see relief on the pork side of the input costs. For instance, hogs were averaging 118 in the third quarter, they're down to 93. Bellies have even come off a little bit, but you'd expect bellies to come off at this time of the year. And we're seeing some relief in trim. Now, the only other -- the only area outside of pork that, from a raw material input that we're seeing, increase is in the beef category. Beef started to go up and our second quarter, and that trend has continued.  So we're seeing relief in the pork industry. Again, this is -- I'll give you the same warning that I did last quarter. Labor is a very important factor as to how these costs are going to trend in both the near and long term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Page, Jim and [Indiscernible] good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim Snee : Good morning, Peter. Peter Galbo : Jim, I just wanted to dive in a little bit deeper on the labor situation. A few of your peers have talked about vacancy rates or open requisitions that they have somewhere in the range of like 6% to 10%, which is obviously elevated versus normal. I guess just the 2 questions that one, can you kind of give us a sense of where that stands for you in terms of open positions. And then secondly, just as we look at the volume number in 3Q, I think it was on at least on an organic basis, like 1.15 billion pounds. Is that a good kind of run rate number to use in terms of your total volume that you could actually produce until the labor situation kind of corrects? Just trying to understand that part. Thanks. Jim Snee : Peter, I would start with, I mean, I think that rate is a good range for us, as well. I mean, it ebbs and flows depending on the week, to be honest with you. But I think if you operate with that number, that range in mind, you're in the ballpark. I think there's always considerations when we talk about our volume number. Clearly, we had lower harvest level this quarter, which does have a dramatic impact on volumes. And so we've got to watch that closely. But taking it to a higher level, yes, the idea of labor in our plants does have an impact on the volume and what we're able to produce.  So that's why it is so important that we do take a very aggressive approach in hiring retained, finding those areas to automate, and how do you simplify your operations. We absolutely have to get that done and there's not a higher priority in the organization from a human resource perspective, and a supply chain perspective. So it doesn't give you the specific number you're looking for, but it does at a high level. Labor is a driver for the volume that we're able to produce. Peter Galbo : No. That's helpful. Thanks, Jim. And A - Jim Sheehan, maybe just two cleanup questions. On the gross margin for the fourth quarter, I think you said improved sequentially, but should we still be expecting that to be down year-over-year? And the second part, I just wanted to make sure that the sales guide for the full year still includes the 53rd week, correct? Jim Sheehan : Yes, everything includes the 53rd week. And as we said, that guidance is an all-in GAAP guidance. There's still going to be pressure on margins in the fourth quarter, but again, we have additional pricing action that are confident will improve this process. And again, we have the same labor issues we dealt with in the third quarter and we still have the same supply issues that we have been dealing with.  So we know what our employment rate is. But some of our suppliers, we have less visibility to and we've had surprises that have interrupted operations and actually have increased our cost as we've had to go out and find alternative solutions. So it's an improving situation, but I would still expect they will trail last year. The fourth quarter of last year had its own challenges, but I think that would be the trend. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Carson Barnes from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. Carson Barnes : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Can you talk a little bit about international pork demand, especially with respect to the African swine fever. As China and other countries work through that. Are you seeing any changes in demand or risks to the business moving forward? Jim Snee : We really haven't at this point, Carson. For us, we've been really focused on shifting our international pork supply to a ractopamine-free supply, and that's really allowed us to open up some new markets and price accordingly. So, I mean, that's for our business, that's really been the big driver on the supply side of the business. The other piece that we'd be remiss if we didn't mention is just the freight availability for pork and other international exports. Although some of our branded exports shows growth, freight availability continues to be a risk in the supply chain going forward. Carson Barnes : Thanks a lot. That's helpful. Operator : Our next question today comes from Adam Samuelson at Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead. Arthur Almeida : Good morning. This is actually Arthur on for Adam. I was hoping we could tackle the inflation question a bit differently. Just looking at the updated guidance and if we take the midpoint of both ranges, it's about a $0.09 downward revision. How much of that $0.09 is attributable to increased inflationary pressures? As you can imagine that the two to $0.07 diluted range leaves it a bit wide for interpretation in terms of how much is actually impacting the business for this year. And if you could also give some color as to what cost buckets those are in outside of feed and maybe by segment. That'd be really helpful. Thank you. Jim Sheehan : We've talked about the inflationary pressure that exists with the business, if we think that pork inputs will be above last year, they will moderate, we believe from third quarter, but there will still be significant pressure on inflation. Beef is going up as I stated. It's still continuing to grow in the fourth quarter. The freight issue isn't going away, so there's going to be pressure on freight. If anything, we've seen increases in freight costs recently. Jim has talked about the problems that we're incurring with ocean freight and the additional expenses that it's taken to overcome those challenges. The labor issue was an issue that is probably the hardest to read right now. What is going to happen to labor, how quickly it will recover or will it recover at all?  And just the challenges of the supply chain are putting pressure throughout the organization. And those are the issues that we've addressed in our guidance. And we think that we've taken a fair approach to that -- to those issues. I think as far as how you categorize it; I would look at the pork and the beef inputs and identify bad. On the other hand, we are seeing tremendous recovery in the foodservice business. And we're still seeing strong demand in the retail. So the demand is there for our products. We've priced appropriately. It's a matter of having the labor that's available to produce the product and to meet the demand. Arthur Almeida : Thank you. And I guess on that point with the labor shortages, is there any way you could quantify the magnitude of some demand that you weren't able to meet due to these labor shortages? Jim Sheehan : I think it's -- as Jim said, it depends what we [Indiscernible] that were being challenged. And as we talked about earlier, it's not just the labor that we have available, sometimes it's interruptions in the supply chain that it's categories that we didn't think we were going to have a problem to pop up. So I would say that constraint is significant and it's across the -- I can't think of a single segment that hasn't been impacted by this labor constraint. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jacob Nivasch with Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead. Jacob Nivasch : Thank you very much for the question. Just one quick one on pricing, but a little bit of a longer-term perspective here. [Indiscernible] about record sales here, but a lot of it is driven by pricing. And I'm just trying to think once inflation presumably does subside. I know you guys have said in the past that pricing for you guys tends to be sticky. So I'm just trying to think once inflation does subside, what does price look like when that time comes? Would we expect to see this kind of this pricing -- the full amount of pricing here stick? Or, I guess, what are you guys thinking, I guess, when that scenario comes? Jim Snee : Thanks, Jacob. The key takeaway from our ability to price is through these cycles, we have demonstrated our ability to expand margins over time. So I think if you start with that as the premise, you'll get a good read on what we're expecting to happen. Now, as you go through each of the different businesses and channels, it will be different. You have our Grocery Products segment, which acts and looks more like a consumer products organization. So that pricing will step. You've got our refrigerated foods retail business that has more commodity elements tied to the pricing.  And so, you will see that move up and down based on the raw material performance. Understanding, of course, going back to my original statement, that we have a history of being able to expand those margins. And that's really what drives our stickiness comment. Doesn't it mean that the pricing is going -- that current level is going to stay in effect, especially in refrigerated foods. What we are able to do, though, is expand that pricing over time as raw materials moderate. That's how we think about stickiness and pricing for us. Jacob Nivasch : I understand. Yeah. Thank you. Jim Snee : Okay. Operator : And the next question comes from Rebecca Scheuneman with Morningstar. Please, go ahead. Rebecca Scheuneman : Good morning, and thanks for the question. So when I kind of look at how your Q3 shaped up, obviously, gross margins are lower. But also, if you look at the SG&A lines, once you strip out those one-time charges, that came in more favorably than I had been expecting. I'm just kind of wondering are these dynamics a reflection of the current environment, or is there something about the Planters business that has lower gross margins, lower SG&A expense? Jim Sheehan : I think that you have both, Rebecca. First of all, you do have the Planters business coming in and as we've said from a -- for a long time since the acquisition, we knew that we'd be able to manage this business in a very efficient manner. And I think you're starting to see some of the things that we talked about. Woodley(ph) did the acquisition that there is an efficiency here that we believe exists. And the first quarter has given us confidence in that belief. As Jim said, we have a higher sales base that we have not added SG&A at the same level.  So I think that's the first thing to look at. The other thing is that there is an efficiency in the business that we've brought forward with. We've talked about Project Orion for a long time. It's adding efficiencies in our SG&A. One quarter in SG&A doesn't make a trend, but we believe that we have a more efficient operation coming out of 2021 that we had coming into it and we believe that that efficiency is going to provide a long-term benefit to the Company. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to A - Jim Snee for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to sharing more about our long-term growth strategy at our investor update on October 14th. In closing, it's clear that we've built a portfolio and business for long-term success. And our team is operating in an incredibly complex business environment. Yet they've been able to deliver record sales results by continuing to execute our long-term growth strategy. While we still have work to do, I am incredibly grateful to and proud of all our team has accomplished in a difficult operating environment. Have a happy and safe Labor Day weekend. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

I want to start this morning by congratulating Jim Sheehan on his upcoming retirement. Jim will be retiring as CFO at the end of the calendar year, so this will be his last earnings call. Jim has over four decades with our company and under his tenure has built a world-class finance, accounting and technology organization. Jim was the guiding force behind Project Orion, an initiative that will benefit our company for decades to come.  For over 43 years, with the last five years as CFO, Jim has been a trusted partner to me and many of my predecessors. Jim helped complete over $5 billion in strategic acquisitions, including Justin\u2019s, Fontanini, Seracci [ph], Columbus, Sadler\u2019s, and our largest acquisition ever, Planters. Equally impressive was Jim\u2019s contribution to reshaping our portfolio as he was also a guiding force behind many of the divestitures we made to transform our company.  Jim\u2019s oversight to our evolution puts us on a solid foundation for the future growth of our company. Additionally, Jim has overseen the distribution of over $2 billion in dividends to our shareholders. In addition to his business accolades, Jim was the key voice behind our game-changing Inspired Pathways program which provides free college education for children of our team members. Jim will be missed, and we wish him well in retirement along with his wife, Jean.  Jacinth Smiley succeeds Jim and brings a wealth of experience from outside Hormel Foods. She has deep and broad domestic and international experience in areas such as corporate finance, public accounting and compliance. Most recently, she served as the Group Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Hormel Foods is fortunate to have Jacinth as CFO and I\u2019m looking forward to her leadership in her new role. My sincere congratulations to both Jim and Jacinth. In an incredibly difficult and rapidly changing operating environment, our team delivered outstanding top line results. We achieved record sales in fiscal 2021, exceeding both $10 billion and $11 billion in sales for the first time. For the full year, sales were $11.4 billion, representing 19% sales growth. On an organic basis, sales increased 14%.  Our top line growth was incredibly balanced as each of our go-to-market sales channels and business segments posted strong double-digit sales gains underpinned by value-added volume growth, pricing, and a better mix.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year increased 4% to $1.73 in spite of inflationary pressure and supply chain challenges. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66. We had an excellent fourth quarter and posted numerous records, including a fourth consecutive quarter of record sales, record diluted earnings per share, and record cash flow from operations. I want to commend our entire team for delivering this impressive performance and the numerous fourth quarter records. Sales increased 43% and organic sales increased 32%. Volume increased 14% and organic volume increased 8%. We grew sales in every segment and every channel for the quarter. Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, all channels grew by over 25%, driven by strong demand and pricing actions in almost every category.  This all-time record performance was led by further acceleration in our food service businesses. Our food service teams across the organization posted 72% sales growth for the quarter, 33% higher than pre-pandemic levels. This followed second quarter growth of 28% and third quarter of 45%. Strength was broad-based with significant contributions from refrigerated foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store, and MegaMex. We also saw a strong recovery in our non-commercial segments, including college and university and K-12 institutions.  Our food service portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the needs of today\u2019s food service operators with labor and time-saving products. I believe our growth in food service is a function of our differentiated value proposition in the industry as well as our dedication during the pandemic. We have grown with our distributor and operator partners during the recovery, strengthening many of our partnerships and decades-long relationships.  The top line performances from our other channels were equally impressive. Retail, deli and international each delivered a second consecutive year of growth. Retail and international sales both increased 34% and deli sales increased 24%. On an organic basis, each channel posted strong double-digit growth. Growth came from numerous brands across all areas of our portfolio, including Spam, Applegate, Columbus, Hormel Black Label, Wholly, Hormel Compleats, Gatherings, and many more. We continue to see very positive trends for consumer takeaway at retail. According to IRI, key metrics for our brands such as buy rate and trips per buyer remained favorable, which indicates elevated consumer spending on our products has remained. We also continued to grow share in many important categories, including Hormel Gatherings party trays, Hormel Pepperoni, Spam luncheon meat, and Hormel chili. Our one supply chain team has done an excellent job operating in and navigating constant supply chain disruptions. We have also seen the positive impact of their strategic actions, namely we\u2019re starting to see an increasing number of our open positions being filled, more automation being implemented in our facilities, and a more simplified product portfolio. In total, these actions are allowing us to maximize our throughput to meet the continued strong demand of our customers. From a bottom line perspective, fourth quarter earnings were a record $0.51 per share, a 19% increase compared to 2020. An acceleration in our top line results and the addition of the Planters business led to the earnings growth.  As we said in the third quarter, we expected margins to improve as pricing actions took effect. Indeed, margins improved sequentially in all four segments. Pricing actions, improved promotional effectiveness, and a more profitable mix all contributed to the improvement. We started to see relief in key raw materials in the fourth quarter compared to prior quarters; however, labor rates, freight, supplies and raw material costs remain above year-ago levels, and in the case of freight increased further. Looking at the segments, grocery products, refrigerated foods and international segments each posted double-digit segment profit growth. Jennie-O Turkey Store profits declined due to higher feed costs. A few highlights from the quarter include the following. Refrigerated foods delivered strong volume, sales and profit growth. The team was able to leverage the numerous capacity expansion projects since the start of the pandemic for categories such a pizza toppings, bacon, and dry sausage. Within grocery products, our Simple Meals and Mexican portfolios generated excellent growth in addition to contributions from the Planters snack nuts business. Notably, the Spam brand delivered its seventh consecutive year of record growth, and we recently announced plans for additional capacity to support future growth. Our international team achieved a seventh consecutive quarter of record earnings growth with strong results from all of their businesses. The momentum this business has generated over the last two years supports our plans to aggressively expand internationally. Lastly, Planters made a positive impact especially in the fast growing snacking and entertaining space and within the convenience store channel. This quarter\u2019s results were outstanding and we intend to build on this momentum going into 2022.  Over the past decade, Hormel Foods has deliberately evolved from a meat-centric, commodity-driven company with a heavy focus on retail pork and turkey to a global branded food company with leading brands across numerous channels. Our company today is more food-forward than ever with a sharp focus on the needs of our customers, consumers and operators. As we begin fiscal 2022, we plan to continue our evolution. First, we will complete the full integration of the Planters business across all functions. The first of three production facilities was successfully integrated in the fourth quarter and the remaining two facilities are scheduled to be fully integrated in our first quarter. Since acquiring Planters six months ago, our sales, marketing, innovation, and R&D teams have been hard at work developing new and innovative products and flavors, many of which will be rolled out this coming year. They have also been working on refreshing the branding and packaging, which will also be launched in 2022. Seeing the great work of our teams has me even more confident about where we are able to take this brand in the future and further strengthens our conviction of the potential for Planters. From a financial standpoint, the Planters business is performing at the top end of our expectations, and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal \u201922. Second, we are also taking a series of actions at Jennie-O Turkey Store. Over time, we expect these actions to result in a more demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio that is better aligned the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators that will result in long term growth, improved profitability, and lower earnings volatility. The transformation starts with accelerating our efforts to shift from commodity to branded value-added products. This is similar to the successful strategy we have executed in refrigerated foods over the past 15 years. As a result, we will close the Benson Avenue plant located in Wilmer, Minnesota in the first half of fiscal 2022. This plant is an older, inefficient facility which produces numerous commodity items. Value-added products will be consolidated into multiple other facilities. Team members will transition to our newer and larger facility, also located in Wilmer, which will supplement staffing levels.  Finally, we will continue to integrate business functions into the Hormel Foods parent organization. Over the past two years, we have successfully integrated IT services, finance and accounting, and HR into the Hormel organization through Project Orion, and we will continue these efforts for other functions. By doing so, we will bring the deep turkey expertise and competitive advantages of the Jennie-O team to the broader organization. I want to be very clear that turkey will continue to play an important role in our company for many brands, including Columbus, Applegate, Hormel Natural Choice, in addition to Jennie-O. Turkey is vital to our balanced business model, serves to diversify our portfolio, and is important to consumers who are looking for high protein, lean and versatile offerings. We will provide a further update and details on the financial components and timing on our first quarter call. Finally, we made additional progress on optimizing our pork supply chain by signing a new five-year raw material supply agreement with our supplier in Fremont, Nebraska. This new agreement more closely matches our pork supply with the needs of our value-added businesses while simultaneously reducing the amount of commodity pork we sell. Similar to the rationale for selling the Fremont plant in 2018, this new agreement further diversifies us away from commodity sales, increases our flexibility within our supply chain, and decreases our earnings volatility. This agreement should result in a reduction of approximately $350 million of commodity fresh pork sales at very low margins. The impact is split between the refrigerated foods and international segments. The contract will be effective at the start of calendar year 2022. The success we are having with Planters, the actions we are taking at Jennie-O Turkey Store, and the continued progress we are making in our pork supply chain all provide great insights into how we are continuing to evolve Hormel Foods for next year and beyond, and not only have we evolved our portfolio but we will continue to evolve how we operate as a company with initiatives such as one supply chain, Project Orion, and our digital experience group. Looking at fiscal 2022, we expect net sales to be between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.87 and $2.03 per share. We expect growth in excess of our long term goals due to organic growth across each of our segments and strength in our Planters business. I have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance with all four segments delivering growth. Jacinth Smiley will provide more color regarding key drivers for our fiscal 2022 outlook. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jim Sheehan to discuss financial information relating to the quarter. Jim Sheehan : Thank you Jim. Good morning. The company achieved record fourth quarter and full year sales of $3.5 billion and $11.4 billion respectively. Organic sales increased 32% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. Planters contributed $411 million in sales for the full year. Earnings before taxes increased 26% for the fourth quarter. Strong results in refrigerated, international, and the inclusion of Planters led to the strong finish to the year despite ongoing inflationary pressures.  Earnings before taxes increased 1% for the full year compared to fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share of $0.51 was a record. This was a 19% increase over last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year was $1.73, a 4% increase from last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.66. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 7.5% compared to 7.9% last year. Strong sales growth and disciplined cost management contributed to the improvement. Advertising investments increased 12% compared to last year.  As anticipated, operating margins in the fourth quarter increased compared to the third quarter as a result of effective pricing actions. Segment margins expanded from last quarter by 136 basis points to 10.7% with increases in each segment. In 2021, inflation, labor shortages, and the Planters deal cost all negatively impacted margins. The fourth quarter results including the continued strong demand of our products are an indication of improved market conditions as we exit the year. Net unallocated expenses in 2021 increased primarily as a result of one-time acquisition costs for Planters and higher interest expense.  The effective tax rate for the year was 19.3% compared to 18.5% last year. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was a record, resulting from strong earnings and disciplined working capital management. Our balanced business model and consistent cash flow provided protection against the complex and challenging business dynamics we navigated during the year, allowing us to invest in numerous capital projects, acquire Planters, and grow the dividend. We paid our 373rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15 at an annual rate of $0.98 per share. We also announced a 6% increase for 2022, marking the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases. During 2021, the company repurchased 500,000 shares for $20 million. Capital expenditures were $232 million. The company ended 2021 with $3.3 billion in debt or approximately 2.5 times EBITDA. Although no mandatory debt repayments are required until 2024, based on our strong cash flow we expect to make incremental payments as soon as the second half of 2022. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and de-leveraging to 1.5 to 2 times EBITDA by 2023. Market conditions for pork input costs remained elevated during the fourth quarter. The USDA composite cut-out averaged 33% higher compared to last year, supported by strong demand for pork and historically low cold storage levels. Hog prices averaged 62% higher than last year but were down 27% compared to the third quarter. Belly, pork trim and beef trim markets were also significantly higher for the quarter compared to last year. The latest estimates from the USDA indicate pork production for the year to decrease 2% compared to 2020 and remain relatively flat in 2022. Labor shortages may continue to be a significant factor affecting industry production.  Turkey industry fundamentals were strong. The whole turkey and thigh meat markets reached all-time highs during the fourth quarter with pressed meat prices above a year ago. Supporting these prices were historically low cold storage levels, lower poult placements, and decline in egg sets. Higher feed costs and labor shortages continued to negatively impact Jennie-O. Feed costs increased over 60% from last year in the fourth quarter. In 2022, we anticipate pork, beef, turkey, and feed prices to remain above historical levels. We delivered strong results in the fourth quarter as the team overcame challenging operating conditions and volatile markets. The performance is a testament to the strength of our brands, pricing power, balanced model, and the teams\u2019 ability to execute in a dynamic market environment.  On a personal note as I reach the end of my career at Hormel, I am thankful for the privilege of working for this great company for the past 43 years. I appreciate the support of Jim Snee, the board of directors and my team over my tenure as CFO. I take great pride in the evolution and accomplishments of the company during my career and leave with the greatest confidence in the future. I have enjoyed my interactions with the shareholders and analyst community, and I wish you well. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley. I know the company is in excellent hands with Jacinth, and you will have an opportunity to get to know her better in the coming months. Jacinth will provide an overview of the fiscal 2022 guidance and further context on our expectations for next year. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you Jim for your kind words. Good morning everyone. For analysts and the investment community on the call, I look forward to meeting you in the coming weeks and months. I am excited to be stepping into the Chief Financial Officer role at Hormel Foods, a company known for its financial strength, its powerhouse brands, and its commitment to employees and communities. In the time I have been at the company, I have found that Hormel Foods is innovative and has a results-driven focus for all stakeholders. As Jim mentioned, allow me to share a bit more commentary regarding key drivers to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Building on the momentum we established during the second half of the year and the strategic investments we have made throughout the pandemic, we expect to generate sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2022 above the long term goals we announced at our investor update in October. We anticipate growth from all four segments, driven by continued elevated demand for our products, the impact from our pricing actions, improved production throughput, new capacity for key categories such as pizza toppings and dry sausage, and the full year contribution of the Planters business. We also expect operating margins to show improvement throughout the year, similar to the dynamic we experienced in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that rapid changes in raw material input costs can shift profitability between quarters. In addition to generating strong sales and earnings growth, we will continue to invest in our leading brands through increases in strategic marketing and advertising, capacity expansions for high growth platforms, and capabilities to drive industry-leading innovation.  The company\u2019s target for capital expenditures in 2022 is $310 million. We are scheduled to open a pepperoni expansion to our newest facility in Omaha during the second quarter, which will provide the needed capacity to meet growing demand in our retail and food service businesses. We are also beginning work on another expansion for the Spam family of products scheduled to be operational in 2023. In addition to these larger projects, we are continuing to invest in cost savings, technology and automation projects to drive long term savings and efficiencies.  Pivoting to innovation, we achieved our 15% goal in 2021. We have strong innovation platforms for brands such as Planters, Skippy, Justin\u2019s, Herdez, and Hormel Black Label at retail, as well as the Jennie-O and Happy Little Plants brands in the food service channel. These platforms in addition to our continuous process and product improvement initiatives give us the confidence going forward to consistently achieve our stated innovation goals. I want to speak for a moment about the complexities of our operating environment. The operating environment is expected to remain complex in fiscal 2022 and our guidance accounts for the near term impacts from labor shortages, higher costs, and supply chain disruptions. Our entire team has done an excellent job executing our business strategies in this dynamic environment. In many ways, we have enhanced our competency for solving the day-to-day challenges inherent to our industry. We have increased our efforts to hire and maintain team members and have developed many strategies to mitigate the effect of labor shortages to meet elevated demand. This includes maximizing our flexibility to produce the items that are most in demand and leveraging our manufacturing partnerships to increase throughput wherever possible.  Our one supply chain team allows us to continue to actively manage our raw material procurement, logistics network and supply partnerships to minimize the impact of further inflation and supply chain disruptions. We will also benefit from our expanded logistics network, which has added capacity for both the refrigerated and grocery product business. As a result of these actions, we expect improved fill rate and load factors in fiscal 2022. The announcement of the Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation is another step in our evolution to become a stronger global branded food company. Consistent with our long term strategy, we are continuing our efforts to actively shift away from commodity businesses towards branded, value-added businesses. We expect our strategic and intentional actions to create a better, more profitable and sustainable business model.  Taking all of these factors into account, as Jim has mentioned, we are setting our full year sales guidance at $11.7 billion to 12.5 billion and our diluted earnings per share guidance at $1.87 to $2.03. Additionally, this guidance reflects the Benson Avenue facility closure, our new pork raw material supply agreement, and an effective tax rate between 20.5% and 22.5%. Fiscal 2022 will be 52 weeks.  As we move forward to execute against our strategic imperatives in 2022 and beyond, I am pleased to be with a company that continues to evolve as a global branded food company. Jim often says we are uncommon. I have seen that firsthand in my time with the company thus far. This starts with our unwavering commitment to employee safety and remaining an employer of choice in the communities we live and work. We\u2019re taking purposeful actions to transform our company as we embark on our most ambitious corporate responsibility journey yet, our 20 by 30 challenge, which is certainly important from an ESG standpoint.  Our experienced management team, the tireless work of our team members around the world, and the progress made to implement the Project Orion and one supply chain initiative gives us added confidence in our ability to deliver growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. I am excited to be with Hormel Foods and be part of its continued success. At this time, I will turn the call over to the Operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions, and Jim Sheehan, congrats on your retirement as well. Jim Sheehan : Thank you Rupesh. Rupesh Parikh : I guess to start, maybe just on the pricing front, if you can just remind us where you guys are with the pricing point, and at this point have you guys seen anything, I guess different versus expectations on the elasticity front? Just curious how your pricing actions have played out so far versus your expectations. Jim Snee : Yes, good morning Rupesh. We have not seen the elasticity that we typically would have been pre-pandemic. The demand has held up really well across the entire portfolio, and really where we are in our pricing journey, we\u2019ve got another round of pricing in our grocery products portfolio that is in the midst of being implemented, executed right now. On the refrigerated side, that\u2019s a pricing model that ebbs and flows, and so we\u2019ve seen some relief in commodity markets - we\u2019re watching it closely, but at this point in time don\u2019t have any additional pricing scheduled for that part of our business. But in grocery products, we do have another round that\u2019s getting implemented right now. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great, and then maybe just a follow-up question just on guidance. I was curious about the latest in terms of what you guys are incorporating for Planters accretion. Is that still in that $0.17 to $0.22 range for this year, and is there anything you could share on the cadence of operating or EPS growth, maybe first half versus second half for this year? Jim Snee : Well, the first part of the question is we are still in that range, and we\u2019re expecting to be on the high end of the range, just like we were in fiscal 2021. As you think about just the business throughout the course of 2022, you\u2019re going to see sales, earnings and margins as really improving throughout the year. As Jacinth mentioned in her comments, we do expect to have continual improvement in the supply chain that will help with fill rates and load factors. Our organic growth will be driven in large part by that improvement. The thing that we have to be on the lookout for, as we were in \u201921, is just the volatility in markets or supply chain. It really can shift profits between quarters. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your questions. Tom Palmer : Good morning, thanks for the questions, and Jim, thank you for your help over the years and congratulations on your retirement. Jim Sheehan : Thank you Tom. Tom Palmer : From what we can see, pork costs have eased a bit in the past couple months, at least on a spot basis. Feed costs are lower than they were earlier this year. At what point do these costs begin the flow through the P&L? Jim Sheehan : I think you saw, Tom, some momentum especially near the end of our fourth quarter that helped with these declining prices. You\u2019ve seen today, for instance, hogs are down to the mid-60 range, they averaged $86 in the fourth quarter You\u2019ve seen trim ease off, and certainly you\u2019ve seen an easing in belly, so you\u2019re starting to see the advantage already. You can see, as I said, in the fourth quarter you saw that momentum start to pick up near the end of the fourth quarter, so I think that we\u2019re in a good position as we go into the first quarter and into the new year. Tom Palmer : On just on the feed side also? Jim Sheehan : Well you know, we\u2019ve locked in our feed costs. We\u2019re under market for--we\u2019ve locked in about 80% of our corn and it\u2019s under the current market, so our feed costs will be stabilized for next year. We have a good handle on the feed costs. You obviously always have the basis risk that exists, but basis has been fairly neutral for the last few months. Tom Palmer : Okay, thank you. If I could follow up just on what that translates to, so you\u2019ve talked about earnings growth in all four segments in the coming year. Should we expect to see that starting in the first quarter, so essentially in the first quarter should we look for growth in all segments? Jim Snee : Yes Tom, we would, and as Jim is describing in the markets and in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing some lower markets right now in the first quarter, but on average over the full year, we do expect them to be fairly flat to 2021, so you are obviously going to have some moves up throughout the year but we do expect all segments to show that growth starting in Q1. Jim Sheehan : And Tom, as you look at 2022, remember you have Planters - we didn\u2019t pick up Planters until the third quarter of last year, so you\u2019ll see the significant improvement in the first half of the year. Tom Palmer : Understood, thank you again. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Samuelson : Yes, thank you. Good morning everyone. Let me echo everyone\u2019s congratulations, Jim, on the retirement. My first question is on Jennie-O, and I was hoping maybe to get a little bit more color on the decision to close the plant. Jim Snee, if you could maybe just elaborate a little bit on how this changes the sales mix margin structure potential of the Jennie-O business moving forward, and a corollary to that is just help us think about costs associated with these actions on a cash basis over the course of the next 12 months. Jim Snee : Sure, so the first thing, Adam, is we\u2019re going to come back to you in Q1 and give you a more detailed report on some of the things that you just described, so we will be getting that information to you. I think the big thing in all of this, these strategic actions that we\u2019re thinking about, is turkey is not going away in our portfolio, right? It\u2019s going to continue to be an important part of our company across many different segments, many different brands. We\u2019ve seen the evolution of our company, whether it was Project Orion, our one supply chain effort, really this opportunity to move away from duplication of resources - that\u2019s the first thing. The second thing is when we\u2019re honest with ourselves, the business has underperformed in recent years, and that\u2019s not through a lack of effort on our team\u2019s part. That\u2019s dealing with a significant oversupply situation that\u2019s created a lot of volatility for us, so as you think about how we\u2019ve managed other parts of the business, it kind of flew in the face of really what we\u2019ve been trying to achieve. Really, this announcement today is a bigger step in that evolution to make sure that we\u2019re moving from a commodity-driven or a supply-driven business to a more demand, consumer-driven business. It also allows us to move towards a more fully integrated supply chain. There is still a lot of work to be done. We\u2019ll be coming back to this group with more information in Q1, but feel like it\u2019s the right and proper first step on the journey to make Jennie-O really a more long term sustainable growth engine for the company. Adam Samuelson : All right, that\u2019s really helpful color. Then just a follow-up on some of the labor challenges that you called out, both in the press release and the script. Was wondering if you could frame just the impact that labor\u2019s had on your production volume. Is it customers who are unable to accept orders because of labor? Any way to dimensionalize the costs, and any comments you\u2019d have on wage rates? Just trying to get a flavor for where we are in terms of managing labor issues and the operations in the supply chain. Jim Snee : Sure. We\u2019re not new to this story. We\u2019ve taken wage rates across our entire hourly plant structure, and we\u2019ve had to become and maintain our very competitive wage rates, so that has added costs. I think the other thing to really understand is just the labor pool in general. The idea that you\u2019re going to rely on the traditional labor pool that you\u2019ve always had, it\u2019s not going to get you where you need to be, so our team has done a really nice job of sourcing non-traditional labor pools, being creative in how we\u2019re staffing our facilities to make sure that we are becoming more employee-friendly, and we\u2019ve seen an improvement. I\u2019m not going to spike the football here and say that we\u2019re over the hump, but we have seen some improvement in our labor rates, and even more importantly is we\u2019ve seen some improvement in key plants for us, so key plants meaning two of our larger refrigerated foods plants have seen dramatic improvement in labor rates. Two of our grocery product plants have seen improvements in labor rates, so that\u2019s been really helpful as we\u2019ve progressed throughout the fourth quarter and then head into 2022. The staffing levels that we\u2019re talking about are really helpful. We still have work to do, but it is setting us up for a better 2022. Adam Samuelson : All right, that\u2019s all really helpful color. I\u2019ll pass it on, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Larson from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Eric Larson : Yes, good morning everyone, and my congratulations to Jim - thank you for all of your help, and Jacinth, congratulations to you. It\u2019s a very coveted executive position in the food industry, and I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s very well earned, so congrats. My question really comes down to your input costs last year - bacon, trim, etc. I think Jacinth talked about the uncommon, and I\u2019ve been doing this industry for a long time and I can\u2019t remember the volatility that we\u2019ve seen in the last year. Your pricing is going to reflect a lot of what the volatility is, but how much of a headwind or even potentially tailwind could your input costs be for pork in \u201922? Jim Snee : Well Eric, it really is more of a timing issue. You think about where we are right now in Q1, and so we have priced to those uncommon markets that you described, and I think we have--we will watch the markets and see what happens, and if the market--if the commodity markets become volatile again, we\u2019ll be prepared to react if we need to.  The other thing to remember in all of this, that we\u2019ve talked about many times, is our grocery products pricing is very sticky, and so the pricing that we\u2019ve taken and that we\u2019re in the midst of executing the additional price increase, that pricing will by and large sustain.  On the refrigerated side, that underlying pricing commodity, we do track that more closely both in retail and food service, so we\u2019ll react accordingly there. But I think your comment is a fair one, that says where we sit today, it\u2019s a tailwind for the organization, we just obviously will be watching the volatility over the course of the year. Jim Sheehan : Yes Eric, the term you used, volatility is the key word. The volatility, as we\u2019ve talked about before, can move earnings between quarters depending on the timing, but if you take out the spikes and you just look at the trends of the increased costs that we\u2019ve been faced with over the last year, we\u2019ve done a remarkable job of pricing into those rising markets, and the demand for our products really hasn\u2019t failed. I think we\u2019ve done a great job with our pricing, I think it\u2019s been very effective. We will have times that volatility will help you or hurt you at times, but you really have to look at this as a long-term trend, and over the long term trend, it really shows that the value of Hormel products are accepted by the consumer and that we are able to price effectively into the marketplace. I think it\u2019s been a great success. Eric Larson : Okay, thanks. Jim, just on that note, you\u2019ve got a new contract with Fremont, I think you disclosed that it was about $350 million worth of commodity pork sales annually. What might be the delta for that, either positive or negative, for \u201922, if you want to just give us a rough range on that? Jim Sheehan : Well Eric, you\u2019ve been in this business long enough to know that it depends on what day it is. Eric Larson : Right. Jim Sheehan : Overall, it\u2019s very insignificant to the business. Some days it would be positive, but there\u2019s a lot of days that it\u2019s very negative, and in fact some of this product that we\u2019ll no longer take will no longer be--you know, was never profitable, so it gave us a little bit of lift in 2021 but it\u2019s really not that significant to the performance of the company, and we\u2019ve talked for a long time about eliminating the volatility around commodity products, so whatever the difference is, it\u2019s so small, the lack of volatility is the success here. We\u2019ve talked for a long time about selling less and less commodity products. The first step was turning over the Fremont facility, which was an old facility that needed a lot of capital. Our goal was always to get to a point where the amount of product we took matched our value-added products and our value-added needs, so this is an evolution of the process. Eric Larson : Okay, thanks. Just one quick follow-up. The industry, the packaged food industry literally in the last several weeks, I think probably the new-news is that we have not taken enough pricing and we\u2019re seeing rounds coming from everybody - General Mills, others have announced that. When you look at your fiscal year now and the pricing is going to be effective, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s around January 1, the full effect won\u2019t take place until your second half. Is that the way to--is it a more second half stabilization of gross profit margins the way to look at it? How should we kind of look at that, at the industry\u2019s new round of pricing and any impact on margins? Jim Snee : Yes, so Eric, a couple of things there. We feel really good, as Jim said, about the pricing we\u2019ve taken so far, and we\u2019re always ready to take additional pricing actions as the market conditions warrant. Through all of this, we still have to be very aware of consumer retention. We want to make sure that we\u2019re not losing consumers through all of this. But in terms of the pricing that I described earlier, really think about it as a second quarter on effect, that it\u2019s being--again, timing varies, but think about it from the second quarter on for the GP portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Bienvenu : Hey, thanks, good morning, and Jim Sheehan, congrats. Enjoy retirement, well earned. I want to ask, as you think about the labor dynamics in the business that exist and the opportunity to further automate, in terms of what you can automate, how much have you, and how do you think about how the current and more sustained tight labor environment has informed your thoughts about what you might think about automating and the returns that you could achieve by doing so? Jim Snee : Yes Ben, we\u2019ve got a number of examples of the automation that we\u2019ve been able to put in place, and we\u2019ve got both ends of the spectrum. When you think about our newer facility in Omaha, we started out with a blueprint that had more automation built into it than we\u2019ve had in our other facilities, so that\u2019s been very, very helpful, whether it\u2019s been racking, loaders, the transfer vehicles. It\u2019s an incredibly automated facility, but you\u2019re starting with a more recent blueprint. In some of our existing facilities, we have always talked about the need for automation and have looked to find those opportunities, but I would say that the opportunity projects have accelerated over the last 12 to 18 months, and so we\u2019ve got a number of projects across multiple facilities where we\u2019ve talked about the package placement, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of the boxing and other packaging opportunities. Mark Coffey did a really nice job in his one supply chain video during our investor update demonstrating that. But I think the other part, and you mentioned it, is how we think about automation going forward and then how do you factor in that labor component, which maybe wasn\u2019t as important to factor in, in previous years, but I do think that\u2019s going to be part of that opportunity cost that has to be figured into the automation equation as we go forward. As we think about it from an engineering perspective, we\u2019re allocating resources in our engineering organization that we\u2019ve never had before to make sure that not only are we identifying existing automation, but really helping to support and develop automation that isn\u2019t even out there yet, that we believe we need in our operations. There\u2019s still a long way to go, a lot of work to be done, but there is a very, very keen focus in our organization to get us there. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, thank you for that. My second question is related to Jennie-O. I know you\u2019ll come back with more details in the first quarter, but should we understand this to mean that by taking these actions, we reset the base of volume off of which you grow and enhance margins going forward, or is this just a consolidation of capacity on existing volume and as a result, you kind of get rid of unused capacity in the facility that you have today? Jim Snee : The answer, Ben, is both. I think when we come back to you, we\u2019ll be talking about what the business is able to generate in terms of growth going forward, but then a second part of your question, it\u2019s really, really important just as we think about how do we fully utilize all of our facilities in our network to make sure that we\u2019re optimizing those opportunities for capacity expansion. Through this integration into our one supply chain network, you\u2019re going to see Hormel lines, perhaps a bacon line be in what traditionally have been a Jennie-O turkey facility, so it\u2019s really leveraging the resources, leveraging the parent company to make sure that we are truly optimizing the assets that we have employed in our business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Theurer : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. As well, Jim all the best in retirement. Hope you can enjoy. I wanted to follow up quickly on Planters. You said you\u2019ve been seeing that you\u2019re basically coming from an accretion point closer to the high end of the range, but if we look into the profitability in the quarter in grocery products, it clearly was down on a year-over-year basis and I guess there was still some of the integration costs. But can you give us a feeling of how you think Planters over time is going to be accretive into 2022 from a margin perspective in grocery products? Jim Snee : I think the best answer there, Ben, is the accretion model that we gave you at time of acquisition was that $0.17 to $0.20 range, and through our comments we\u2019ve indicated that we expect to perform at the high end of that range. Of course that is a mix in grocery products and in our food service or convenience store channel, which is part of refrigerated foods. The business itself has been operating really, really well, meeting our expectations. The integrations have gone smoothly. We talked about already integrating one facility, the other two are right behind it, so the business is doing everything that we thought it would do so far. But then, the opportunities going forward in terms of what we\u2019re going to be able to do from branding, flavors, innovation - I mean, there\u2019s still a lot to come, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about what it has contributed and will contribute in the future. Ben Theurer : Okay, perfect. Then my follow-up question is really more around the product, and I remember you\u2019ve talked a lot about the big potential you\u2019re seeing with in creating new products, innovation, Planters as an opportunity to leverage some of the other categories within snacking. If you would have to take a look at the first couple of months of operations, is that something you continue to be very positive on? Have you seen any incremental opportunities to grow that business and to combine it with existing snacking opportunities, and where do you think this is going to turn out in more of the medium term time frame? Jim Snee : Sure, so there\u2019s two parts to that. On the retail front, we are having different, more fruitful conversations with retailers in regards to snacking as a category and how we approach that as an organization, and that\u2019s exactly what we expected on the retail side. On the food service or convenience store channel, the same thing is happening - we\u2019re having much different conversations with convenience store operators. In the past, everything we did was the back of the house when you went in to get food for sandwiches or pizza. Now, that retail section of the convenience stores has been opened up because now we have something to talk about with Planters, and we\u2019re able to follow on with other parts of our portfolio. Those are the new things for us. There was some basic blocking and tackling that we knew we\u2019d be able to get done as well in terms of filling distribution gaps, just like we did when we acquired the Skippy business. Again, you start piecing this all together and that\u2019s why we remain so optimistic about the acquisition and what it holds for us going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question. Jim, best wishes in your retirement. I hope you never have to talk about trim or belly prices ever again. Jim Sheehan : It\u2019s my favorite thing to do, Rob! I get up in the morning hoping to talk about trim and belly prices. Come on! Robert Moskow : Why are you retiring then? Hang around! I would like to know about the guidance, the earnings guidance. If I just assume $0.20 of accretion from Planters, then I don\u2019t get much growth from the core business, and you are forecasting growth across your core business, so is the trick here to take the earnings base for \u201921 and reduce it for the extra week, and if so, how much should I reduce it? I suppose I should also strip out the acquisition integration costs that you had, which I think are maybe $0.04 in 2021. Maybe you can help me with the math on that, and then I have a quick follow-up. Jacinth Smiley : As we explained before in my prepared comments and then Jim and Jim, we do expect to have both sales and earnings growth through all segments for next year. We definitely do have some puts and takes, so the 53rd week is about $0.03, so we would pull that piece out, and again Planters is at the top end of our range that we gave with $0.17 to $0.22, so that\u2019s a piece of it.  I think with that, it should really get you to showing sales and earnings growth and margin growth throughout the year. Certainly it will vary, as we talked about, from quarter to quarter, but we do expect to see organic growth especially with new capacity coming on and really sits in the range of our long term goals that we have established and talked about at investor day. Jim Snee : Rob, the only other thing I would add just as a point of clarification, is you had mentioned $0.04 of deal costs. We\u2019ve talked about that as $0.06, so there\u2019s another $0.02 there that you want to put into your model. Robert Moskow : Okay. Regarding the deal costs, did you have $30 million year-to-date pre-tax, or--? How much in 2021 so far? Jim Sheehan : It\u2019s closer to $40 million when you take in all of the issues. Robert Moskow : Got it, okay. Okay.  I guess with your sales up so dramatically in the last couple of quarters, I would think you\u2019d also have your biggest sales gains in first quarter and second quarter, just because of the commodity pricing. Is it fair to say that first and second quarter strongest sales growth will be there, but maybe margins will be kind of compromised because of just the mathematics of the profit flow-through? Jacinth Smiley : I guess I would say again, it depends, right? There is volatility, and being so commodity-driven, that can really flip at any point in time, so that\u2019s why we continue to stress just that shift from quarter to quarter. It\u2019s something that we need to watch out for, but we do feel good about the full year and the growth that we\u2019re expecting, both from the organic piece of it and then what Planters is adding. Jim Snee : Rob, your assessment on the first two quarters is correct, because you\u2019re going to have--a big part of that will be Planters, which will be $600 million to $700 million for the full year, but basically against zero last year in the first two quarters. Robert Moskow : Great, okay. Best wishes. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning everyone. Rob took my joke as well, but Jim, best of luck and good luck in your retirement. It is well deserved. Jim Sheehan : Thank you Ken. Ken Zaslow : Let me just ask, how much has your margin structure been inhibited by labor and low utilization rates over the last year, and do you think you\u2019ll regain a majority of that in 2022? Jim Snee : Ken, there\u2019s been the impact that is probably easily quantifiable when we think about commodity costs, packaging costs, freight costs, all those things that you see, but there are other costs that have been built into this crazy volatile year, and the idea of all of a sudden one week, you might have film or ingredients or things that aren\u2019t showing up as planned and having to react as a supply chain to make sure that you\u2019re sourcing those, and when you\u2019re looking to source those, it\u2019s about supply, not cost. There are a lot of those examples on a week-to-week basis in the environment we\u2019re in right now. I think as the entire supply chain, backwards and forwards, starts to moderate throughout the year, we\u2019ll be able to capture more of those or have those go away so it will be less of an impact, and I think it\u2019ll just happen throughout \u201922 and probably--I mean, we\u2019re hoping that there\u2019s just more normalcy as we head into 2023. Ken Zaslow : Okay. Then with your turkey actions, how do you much think that will structurally enhance your turkey margins? I\u2019m not talking about the industry, but your actions, is that worth about 100 basis points, 150? How do you contextualize the margin enhancement based on your actions in turkey? That will be my last question, I\u2019ll leave it two questions. Jim Snee : Yes, thanks Ken. Two things there. The first driver through all of this for the [indiscernible] piece is really moving away from that commodity nature of the business, creating less volatility that we\u2019ve seen over the last five years. We\u2019ll be--like I said, we\u2019ll come back to you in Q1 and give you a lot more color in terms of what you can expect from that business going forward. Ken Zaslow : Great, thank you guys. Be well. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Galbo : Hey Jim and Jim and Jacinth, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll keep it to one because I know we\u2019re a bit over time. I guess just on the new pork supply contract, I think historically you disclosed that you buy about 10,000 hog carcasses a day from Wholestone kind of at the cut-out price, and I just wanted to understand in the new contract, because you\u2019re not buying all of the cuts now, how we should think about if that\u2019s priced differently, are you buying only at belly prices or trim prices, is it still that same 10,000 equivalent a day? Just any more detail there to help us understand some of the pork costs. Jim Sheehan : Sure Peter. If you think about it, bellies, trim obviously are in high demand, but hams, for example, we sell hams out onto the market, and so we just pass through hams. That would be an item that we wouldn\u2019t take. There\u2019s multiple items that we\u2019d take during certain parts of the season, for instance ribs. It basically allows us to agree to take the products that we need for our value-added production. Peter Galbo : And is that 10,000 equivalent hogs or whatever the number was, is that still a good baseline to use? Has the contract expanded? Jim Sheehan : Sure, yes, that\u2019s a good baseline. For instance, off of their lines, we would take all of their hogs, we would take the trim, we would take various other cuts of meat that we needed our production, and there are certain types of things that we would not--we may not take any of them because we just--you know, as I said, it\u2019s just a commodity product that\u2019s being passed through, and if commodity margins, whether they\u2019re positive or negative.  When you look at the critical inputs, think about 10,000 hogs. Peter Galbo : Got it, thanks very much, Jim. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you, good morning. I\u2019ll echo all the congrats, Jim, and welcome to Jacinth. Wanted to just touch on the capacity piece, maybe two things. One is for the pepperoni expansion in 2Q - any sense of when within 2Q that might come? Should we really just count on any bump-up there in the second half?  I guess the maybe bigger question is how does the guidance--how does the capacity expansion fit in guidance, and maybe getting at if there\u2019s any delays, would that potentially impact what the outlook might be? Jim Snee : We\u2019re still thinking about it being operational in the second quarter, so you\u2019re really going to see the ramp-up in Q3 back half of 2022. We\u2019ve got it modeled and right now, Michael, there is no indication that we\u2019re going to have any delays getting the plant up and running, so we are very, very confident in our ability to meet the numbers that we\u2019ve put into our plan for 2022. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Just on the margin side, you\u2019ve got some mix lift from the new Fremont contract, you\u2019ve touched on pricing and productivity, and it certainly looks like some of the costs are turning more favorably. As you build out your plan, can you just point to maybe what\u2019s the most critical? Is it the cost moderation, is it the pricing piece, are they similar in weight? How do we think about the build to the margin piece that you\u2019re seeing? Jim Snee : What you\u2019re describing, Michael, is exactly right - we\u2019ll get the benefit of some of the raw material declines that we\u2019ve seen. But the pricing here is key, so our ability to get the pricing through when we did was very, very important. I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a track record of being able to expand margins on the other side of these market declines, which we expect to be able to do again. It\u2019s a combination of both of those things. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Carson Barnes from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question. Carson Barnes : Morning, thanks for the question. Just in terms of cost, what do you see as the biggest risk in 2022? It sounds like feed costs are hedged for the most part. Do you see it as transportation or packaging or wages? Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that and where you\u2019re the most exposed. Jim Snee : The biggest risk, Carson, is the volatility. We expect freight to continue to show increases, we know that packaging is going to have some increases in 2022, and we\u2019ve built that into our plan already. Really, where you get caught in it is more of that quarter to quarter thing, is the volatility like we saw in 2021, so from our perspective as we sit here today on December 9, it\u2019s the volatility throughout the year that really poses the biggest risk again this year. Carson Barnes : Makes sense. Thanks for the question. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you for joining us this morning. It\u2019s clear that we have a lot of momentum in our business as we head into 2022. This momentum didn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s a result of a lot of hard work by our team members around the globe, and I am incredibly thankful for all this great work that has put our company in this enviable position. I wish all of you a very safe and happy holiday season, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, with that we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Good morning, everyone. I want to start off by thanking our dedicated team members around the world for once again achieving strong results in a complex and dynamic environment. The combination of our execution and balanced business model allowed us to deliver strong first quarter results, keeping us on track to achieve our sales and earnings guidance for the year. These results further demonstrate the importance of our strategy, the positive impact of our actions and our team's ability to perform in challenging operating conditions. Our entire team can be proud of our accomplishments this quarter. In the first quarter, our team delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record sales and achieved high-quality earnings growth. Net sales surpassed $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, a 24% increase. Operating income also increased significantly, up 19%. Most importantly, demand for our products remained elevated across all our business segments and go-to-market channels. We increased advertising investments during the quarter to sustain our momentum. Our One Supply Chain team once again demonstrated their resiliency and allowed us to deliver organic growth in our domestic value-added businesses for the quarter. From late December through January, our team experienced some of the heaviest operational impacts that we have seen since the start of the pandemic. These impacts stemmed from significant labor shortages due to the Omicron variant, severe upstream and downstream disruptions and industry-wide operational challenges. I want to again thank our One Supply Chain team for their tireless work and their unwavering commitment to employee safety in these challenging times. Fiscal 2022 is an important year as we return to top and bottom line growth. Our path forward, which we detailed at our Virtual Investor Day in October, represents the 6 strategic imperatives that will guide our actions over the next few years. These include expanding our leadership in foodservice, protecting and growing our core brands, aggressively developing our global presence, amplifying our scale in snacking and entertaining, enhancing growth of our ethnic and Food Forward portfolios and continuing to transform our company. To provide added color on the quarter as well as our long-term views on the business, I'd like to give an update on the progress we have made since October. In the first quarter, we again demonstrated our leadership position in the foodservice channel. Sales were 51% ahead of last year. We continue to benefit from our direct sales force and differentiated portfolio, which is perfectly positioned to meet the needs of today's foodservice operators with labor and time-saving products. We saw improvement in almost every category across our portfolio of foodservice businesses. Consumer demand for food away from home has been very strong. And according to recently published government and technomic data, conditions are improving across the food service industry to help meet this demand. Foodservice sales have risen at an average rate of approximately 25% over the trailing 12-month period, accelerating through the close of calendar year 2021. Operator sentiment also continues to improve from pandemic lows, and foodservice industry employment has made steady gains. These factors, coupled with the demand we are seeing for our products across all geographies in the U.S., support our positive views on the near-term and long-term health of the industry. As we look forward, we plan to further expand our leadership position in areas like restaurants, hotels, colleges and universities and use the scale of the Planters brand to grow our company's presence in emerging growth spaces, such as convenience stores. We also expect to protect and grow our core brands in fiscal 2022 and into the future. Our retail businesses grew sales 17% during the first quarter. We have leading positions in over 40 categories, with brands such as Hormel Black Label, SPAM, SKIPPY, WHOLLY and Jennie-O. Elevated demand for many of these core brands over the last 2 years has surpassed our ability to fully supply. And in these highly inflationary times, having leading brands that connect to consumers in meaningful ways is vital to success. We understand the importance of brand stewardship. And in the first quarter, we increased advertising investments in each business segment to ensure our brands remain well supported, collectively increasing advertising investments by 38%. The strong brand equity we have built over a decade has allowed us to simultaneously increase our household penetration, grow the size and our share in many of the categories in which we compete and implement strategic pricing actions to help offset inflationary pressures. We have made excellent strides connecting with consumers in the e-commerce channel as well. During the quarter, we exceeded overall category growth, with more than 12% of our IRI track retail sales now coming from this particularly important and fast-growing channel. Transitioning to our third priority, we need to aggressively develop and expand our global presence. Our international business is healthy and positioned for long-term growth despite issues affecting the first quarter. Similar to the broader industry in China, we experienced some demand softness, predominantly in foodservice, due to the country's COVID-related restrictions. Additionally, limited railcar availability and U.S. port congestion negatively affected our export business. As we look ahead, our export business is expected to benefit from demand for our global brands such as SPAM and SKIPPY. Our China business is expected to see growth from its scalable foodservice business as well as from retail, with momentum behind the SPAM brand and innovative snacking items such as beef, turkey and SKIPPY funkiness. And we have made considerable progress growing our global presence through our partnerships in the Philippines, South Korea, Europe and Indonesia. We have great partners in these geographies who share our growth mindset. To further support growth, we plan to continue to make many investments into our international business this year. During the first quarter, we increased brand investments in advertising. Later this year, we will open a new Asia Pacific research and development facility, which will support our operations in China and throughout Southeast Asia. And we have plans to further build out our infrastructure in the important Chinese market. We expect to bring meaningful scale to other select global markets as well. And we are making the necessary investments to succeed long term. Our fourth priority focuses on our next growth platform, snacking and entertaining. Snacking and entertainment cuts across all segments and channels, and we are ideally positioned to leverage our powerful and complementary portfolio of brands across salsa, guacamole, nut butters, nuts and premium deli meats. Planters is a cornerstone to our snacking platform, and that business continues to perform at the high end of our expectations. We completed the supply chain integration of the Planters and Corn Nuts businesses in February. As a result, we expect continued synergies and improved customer service levels going forward. As we discussed, when we announced the acquisition of the Planters business, we are on track to launch many new innovative items, including Planters Sweet & Spicy Dry Roasted peanuts and introduce a refresh to the branding and packaging. We're also investing in the brand, including our newest campaign, All or One. Seeing the great work of our teams has made me even more confident about where we can take this brand in the future and further strengthens our belief in the potential for Planters. Our fifth initiative is to enhance the growth of our ethnic and Food Forward portfolios. Our MegaMex and Applegate businesses have been growing, and we are evolving our portfolio at a rapid pace to meet the changing needs of today's consumers. Our MegaMex business grew volume and sales during the first quarter, led by strong demand for WHOLLY products at retail. Applegate delivered another outstanding quarter, with growth across the portfolio from products such as breaded chicken, breakfast sausage and sliced meats. Applegate has given us a clear competitive advantage in the natural and organic meat space and has provided a platform for some of our most important environmental work, such as regenerative agriculture. Finally, we need to continue to transform our company to enable future growth by modernizing our organization. Initiatives like Project Orion, One Supply Chain and our automation efforts are all focus areas, as is the work we are doing to transform the Jennie-O Turkey Store business. As promised from our fourth quarter call, we want to give you an update on our Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation. Our priority has been to build a more demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators that will result in long-term growth, improved profitability and lower earnings volatility. To that end, we have taken numerous actions and will take many more actions to optimize our business model. During the first quarter, we started to see the benefits of our actions of shifting from commodity to branded value-added products. For an example, as an industry leader in turkey, we are investing behind the Jennie-O brand to drive greater growth in our most profitable, high-growth product lines in retail and foodservice. In conjunction with driving improvement in our value-added products, we are also taking aggressive actions to optimize our portfolio. Combined with increased pricing, our brand investments and SKU rationalization are leading to a healthier business. From a supply chain perspective, we remain on track to close the Benson Avenue facility in Willmar, Minnesota, in the second quarter. Our Benson Avenue team members are currently transitioning to our newer and larger facility in Willmar, which will supplement our staffing levels. To date, the Jennie-O supply chain has largely been run separately from the rest of our supply chain, here to it being vertically integrated. By the start of fiscal 2023, we will leverage our One Supply Chain capabilities to integrate all facilities into the broader Hormel Foods network. As we integrate these plants into the Hormel Foods network and rationalize commodity SKUs, we will free up plant space for additional production capacity of many product lines that will service any brand in the Hormel Foods portfolio. This is a monumental step and one that will make our entire company more efficient. Similar to the integration of the supply chain, we will integrate key business functions more deeply into the Hormel Foods organization. In addition to integrating IT services, finance and accounting and HR, we integrated the R&D organization into Hormel Foods R&D during the first quarter. Looking to the remainder of the fiscal year, we will start the process to integrate other business functions, such as our selling organization and marketing teams, into the broader organization. This integration will leverage the strengths of the parent company and the knowledge of Turkey to create a better business model. Over time, we expect the Jennie-O Turkey Store business to achieve higher or stable growth and improved profitability. We also expect other financial gains, including increased asset efficiency, higher manufacturing throughputs, better labor utilization and CapEx avoidance. We expect these changes will drive selling, general and administrative cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million annually by fiscal 2023. In addition to the progress we have made on our 2022 Path Forward, we continue to invest in our people, our partners and our communities to deliver on our ESG commitments. During the first quarter, we distributed our annual profit sharing for the 83rd consecutive year. We continued our environmental stewardship work, with investments in additional wind energy projects, which strengthens our position in renewable energy. We supplied donations to many causes, responded to crises where we could help and supported many local communities. Additionally, our Inspired Pathways Community College program continued to receive accolades and was awarded an Anthem Award for the most impactful corporate initiative in education, arts and culture. And because of our good work, we continue to be recognized. We were recently named one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek, one of the world's top female-friendly companies by Forbes and as a Best of the Best Employer for the ninth consecutive year by the Military Times. With our strong start to the year in the face of challenging operating conditions, we are reaffirming our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2022. We expect net sales to be between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.87 and $2.03 per share. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes, among other things, elevated levels of demand across our go-to-market channels; margin improvement from our efforts to combat inflation, including pricing actions and a positive shift in mix; strength from our high-growth brands and businesses, including Columbus, Applegate and foodservice; continued Planters\u2019 performance at the high end of our expectations; improved supply chain performance as labor pressures ease; and the benefit of new capacity for dry sausage, pizza toppings, bacon and other value-added products. I believe our team has always had a keen competency to evolve and adapt as conditions change. We have certainly improved upon this competency over the last 2 years and we were able to leverage it again to drive growth in the first quarter. I expect our team will continue to navigate and overcome the challenging operating environment to deliver our growth goals this year. Our results-focused mentality is just another factor that makes our company and our Inspire team members uncommon. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss financial information relating to the quarter and provide more color on key drivers to our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I want to echo Jim's comments on how proud I am of our entire team and how we collectively rose above the challenges we encountered in the first quarter. During the first quarter, we delivered record sales of $3 billion, a 24% increase. Organic sales increased 13% for the quarter. Gross profit increased $89 million compared to last year, a 20% increase. This improvement was driven by strength in Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and the addition of the Planters snack nuts business. Gross profit margin was 17.7% compared to 18.3% last year. Pricing actions across all businesses did not fully offset double-digit increases in freight expenses and continued supply chain disruptions. We are encouraged by the quarter-over-quarter improvement in gross margin as our pricing initiatives catch up with the dramatic inflation we have seen over the past year. We increased advertising investments in all 4 segments to support the Planters, SPAM, Jennie-O and SKIPPY brands as well as the Hormel pepperoni and Hormel chili product line. For the quarter, advertising expense increased by 38% or approximately $0.02 per share. SG&A expenses increased 15% compared to last year due to the addition of the Planters snack nuts business and higher advertising investments for our brands. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased to 7.4% from 8% last year. This speaks to our strong sales growth and disciplined cost management. Operating income increased 19% to $320 million. Operating margins were 10.5% compared to 10.9% last year. Operating margin increased sequentially from 10.4% in the fourth quarter. Interest expense increased $6 million compared to last year, driven by the debt we took out in June to fund the acquisition of the Planters snack nut business. We expect a similar amount of interest expense for each quarter during fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate increased to 22.4% from 19.7% last year, a 270 basis points increase. Last year's tax rate benefited from a state tax settlement. Our effective tax rate guidance of 20.5% to 22.5% is unchanged from our prior outlook. The net result of all these factors was diluted earnings per share of $0.44, a 7% increase over $0.41 last year. Turning to our segment results. Three of our 4 segments delivered sales and profit growth, which is a testament to our balanced business model. In total, segment profit increased by 13% as growth in Refrigerated Foods, Grocery Products and Jennie-O Turkey Store more than offset the decline in International. Refrigerated Foods volume decreased 4% and organic volume decreased 5%. The decline in volume was due to our strategic decision to restructure a pork supply agreement to reduce our exposure to low-margin commodity pork business. Sales increased 19%, and organic sales increased 17%. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 15%, led by the strength in our foodservice business and decisive pricing actions we took across many of our branded businesses. The team was able to overcome double-digit increases in freight rates and significant supply chain challenges to deliver this impressive result. Like prior quarters, Refrigerated Foods continues to be negatively affected by production constraints due to labor challenges. Market conditions for key inputs such as hogs, bellies, pork trim and beef trim remained elevated and above year ago levels. Further, most markets increased throughout the quarter, which can cause margins to narrow as our pricing catches up with input costs. Looking at the first month of the second quarter, we continue to see increases in hogs, cut-out and belly prices. Elevated levels of domestic and international demand, low levels of cold storage and industry-wide labor shortages continue to be material factors affecting protein production. Grocery Products volume increased 22% and sales increased 48% due to the addition of the Planters snack nuts business. Organic volume increased 1% and organic sales increased 7%. Segment profit increased 8% due primarily to the addition of the Planters snack nuts business. This more than offset a decline at our MegaMex joint venture due to steep increases in avocado prices and significant increases in freight, steel, aluminum and other supply chain costs across the business. Production constraints also limited our growth in volume, sales and segment profit. Jennie-O Turkey Store had an excellent quarter, with sales up 15% and segment profit up 62%. Improvements in foodservice, increased whole bird shipments and pricing actions across all categories contributed to the performance. Like our other businesses, Jennie-O Turkey Store also absorbed higher logistics and supply chain costs. Feed costs increased by over 35% compared to last year. We took decisive action last year to hedge most of our grain costs, which protects us from major shifts in market prices during the fiscal year. The international segment had a challenging first quarter caused by COVID-19-related restrictions in China and U.S. export logistics challenges. Volume decreased 17% and organic volume decreased 19%. Sales decreased 3% and organic sales decreased 6%. Segment profit declined 19% due to lower sales and logistics challenges. We see the current challenges as more transient in nature and remain optimistic about our international growth opportunities. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow from the first quarter increased 87% to $384 million. Capital expenditures were $50 million compared to $40 million last year. Our target for capital expenditures in 2022 is unchanged at $310 million. We paid our 374th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $1.04 per share, a 6% increase over last year. Dividend growth remains a high priority. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We will repurchase shares opportunistically based on our internal valuation. We ended the first quarter with $3.3 billion in debt or approximately 2.3x EBITDA. Although no mandatory debt repayments are required until 2024, based on our strong and consistent cash flow, we expect to make incremental payments as soon as the second half of 2022. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and deleveraging to 1.5x to 2x EBITDA by 2023. As Jim mentioned, we are reaffirming our sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2022. A key factor in our outlook is the ongoing complexity of the current operating environment. We are managing several key factors, including input cost inflation and the performance of our upstream and downstream supply chain. We see elevated demand, both domestically and abroad, but disruptions from both suppliers and logistics partners are impacting our ability to fully meet the demand. Our One Supply Chain team continues to improve the hiring and retention of team members and has developed many innovative strategies to mitigate the effect of labor shortages. With the strong demand that we continue to see across all our businesses, we are maximizing our production flexibility to produce the items that are most in demand, increasing internal capacity, leveraging our co-manufacturing partnerships to increase throughput and making improvements to transportation load factors. We have been combating extreme input cost volatility and inflation over the past 2 years. Our experienced management team has done an excellent job managing profitability through multiple rounds of pricing actions, effective management of promotional expenses, strategic shifts in product mix and disciplined management of SG&A. Financially, the actions our team is taking should result in quarter-over-quarter improvement in operating margins throughout fiscal 2022. During my first quarter as Chief Financial Officer, I have been incredibly impressed with the accountability, commitment to results and pride I see across our entire company. This gives me even more confidence in our ability to deliver growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of this call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ken Zaslow of the Bank of Montreal. Kenneth Zaslow : Can you talk about elasticity, of where you're seeing it, where you're not seeing it and how you're thinking about it for the next 6 to 12 months? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean really, Ken, we haven't seen any elasticity across any of the portfolio. As we've said, really strong demand across all channels and all categories. And for us right now, I mean, there's just so much noise in distribution and fill rates, demand being strong. And we just haven't seen that elasticity yet. As you would expect, we're continuing to monitor all the various dynamics but just haven't seen it yet, and it's really, really hard, with all that noise, to draw a line and stand to say when we're going to start to see it. You know it's going to come, but it's just really hard to project when that's going to happen given all the other issues I described. Kenneth Zaslow : And then my follow-up question is, when you think about your capabilities to supply products and your production supply chain, can you talk about from a time period, so last year, now and now going a year forward, where have you seen the most supply constraints in your production? Where are you now relative to that? And where will you be in a year from that? And how does that change or help your sales and operating profit? And I'll leave it there, and I appreciate it. Jim Snee : Sure. Thanks, Ken. Actually, I'm going to start with the last part. Obviously, a year from now, we expect to be in a much better position. And when we think about not only the continued improvement with labor that we're seeing across the entire supply chain, the added capacity that we've recently completed, projects that we have in the queue that we've talked about and then a lot of other small projects as well as continuing to build out our co-manufacturing network, a year from now, we will be in a much better position. As we progress throughout the balance of this year, we expect to be incrementally better as we go along. And so the biggest driver right now is our ability to continue to add labor to our facilities. I'd say right now, we've got about 1/3 of our plants that are fully staffed and have made progress across all of our plants. If you remember, in our last conversation, I talked about how we have made progress in some select plants, now we've made progress in all of our facilities. And all of that's going to lead us to be in an incrementally better position throughout the year. Operator : The next question is from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : Maybe to kick off, I just want to clarify the EBIT margin outlook. I think you said expect it to improve sequentially throughout the year. If I look, though, on EBIT margin, it looks like the second quarter on just kind of a seasonal basis is typically one of the stronger ones of the year and then you see the second half a bit weaker. So is it even, looking past seasonality, you expect to kind of have a linear progression of increases as the year progresses? Jim Snee : Yes. So Tom, it's a great question. And as we've talked about, we're starting to see margins improve quarter-over-quarter. And really, the driver is our pricing, right? And so our pricing is catching up with inflation. But of course, inflation continues to move further and further away from us. And as you think about pricing, there's really, in my mind, 3 ways to think about it. There's the pricing that's fully implemented. There's pricing that we currently have in process. And then there's pricing that's really yet to come. And so that's what's going to drive the margin improvement. And we do, for the rest of the year because of that pricing, strong demand, expect continued quarter-over-quarter improvement. Thomas Palmer : Okay. And I guess the follow-up would be on kind of the gross margin side. I think a quarter ago, the talk was gross margin expansion for the year. I assume that's still in place, just given the guidance. But maybe for the second quarter, should we look for gross margin to expand year-over-year? Or is that more a second half event? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. So the expectation, Tom, is exactly that, that we'll continue to see that expansion for the second quarter, but also continuing through the rest of the year as well. Operator : The next question is from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Jim, in your prepared remarks and in the press release this morning, you spoke pretty positively about Planters. It seems like in some of the Nielsen data though, there's maybe been a bit of a disconnect, and I don't know if that's around service level issues or untracked channels. So I was just hoping, as service levels improve, do you expect to see the scanner data start to get better? Can you just give us a more full picture on exactly what you're seeing at Planters that might be disconnected from the data? Jim Snee : Yes, it's a great question, Peter, and you've hit it right on the head. I mean we are optimistic about the Planters business, and there's a couple of things to consider. The IRI data only covers a portion of the business, albeit a large portion. There's still a significant portion in our foodservice or convenience channel that's really off to a good start as well. But your comment is exactly right is that we have had service level issues in Q1. It's fair to say that we've had a disproportionately amount of lower fill rates across the board. We talked about how we now have this business under our full control as of Q2. And in the first period of Q2, I mean we've already seen improvements in fill rates. And so the team has done a really nice job with Planters and doing what we said we were going to do in terms of how we invest in the advertising. Of course, we had our Super Bowl ad that we ran, the work that we're doing in innovation, introducing a new sweet and spicy flavor, with packaging innovation yet to come. Our sales team, now that they've got their arms around the business, are doing a nice job expanding distribution. And then I mentioned the foodservice channel with convenience stores really have an impact there as well. So that's why we're so optimistic. But your read through in terms of service levels and fill rates in Q1 is exactly the issue in the short term. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And just to add to that, with all that Jim has just mentioned, we expect Planters to continue to perform at the top end of the guidance that we have given. Peter Galbo : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just on Jennie-O, helpful detail around the SG&A savings for '23. I was just curious though, I think last quarter you had mentioned maybe we'd get a more detailed breakout this quarter on upfront costs related to shutting down the plant and some of the other transitional costs. And then as well on Jennie-O, the comment on feed costs, up 35%, is that inclusive of your hedging? Or is that just what cost to be up if you weren't hedged, I guess? Jim Snee : Yes. So we'll probably tag-team this one, Peter. As we think about what's happened in the Jennie-O operating environment, obviously, it's become an incredibly dynamic this quarter, when you see what's happened with some of the fundamentals, all of which are favorable. And so it's really hard to go through line by line in such a volatile environment. The key takeaway remains so that there's a long-term strategy here that will alter this business to become more demand-oriented. And that's really the most important takeaway in all of this. And so the team has done a lot of great work in terms of how we are going to optimize this business over the long term, how we're going to leverage the strengths of both Jennie-O Turkey Store and the parent company. Obviously, we talked more about the integration of some of the sales and marketing efforts going forward. And I mean, those are the things that are going to get us to the long-term strategy of that demand for key value-added products over the long term. And so that's really the key takeaway. I'll let Jacinth maybe talk a bit more about the grain prices. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. As it relates to the green prices, certainly, the costs that you're seeing and the prices that we're seeing is included in what we have hedged. And so we are more hedged than normal. So we feel good about being able to just cover down some of that headwind from a grain price perspective. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So just given your exposure to both foodservice and retail, I was just curious how you guys think about maybe normalization of food-at-home demand in the coming quarters, especially with COVID cases going down now. Jim Snee : Yes. I mean it's really hard, again, Rupesh, to say when that's going to happen, what behaviors have changed. What we do know is from a foodservice perspective, there is pent-up demand. This has been a bit of a roller coaster ride over the last 2 years in terms of starting and stopping consumers, being able to get out and travel, go on vacation, then actually have to retreat back to the home. And so again, it's hard to project exactly when and how those shifts are going to take place. The important part here is how we've built this portfolio, the balance that we have across the organization, both foodservice and retail. So as that shift occurs, we're going to be well prepared to take advantage of it. But I do think, again, the foodservice business has obviously demonstrated incredible growth and we really don't see any signs of slowing down because of that pent-up demand that I described. In addition to that, it's the great work that our direct sales team is doing to connect with operators who, even though they're seeing improvements in labor, they still have challenges. And so all of that, again, leads us to be very optimistic about the entire portfolio and the intentional balance that we've built across the portfolio over the years. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So on MegaMex, I know there's a smaller contribution this quarter due to some of the cost pressures. Do you expect that contribution to improve in the future quarters? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean I do think the avocado situation was a bit out of the ordinary for this time of the year, and so we do expect that business to get better throughout the year. Operator : The next question is from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : I actually wanted to follow up on MegaMex, if I can, one moment. Can you elaborate how the situation has now turned out in terms of the supply of some of the avocados that's coming in? I mean they received some big deduction. Are you having some inventory issues here? And when do you think that is going to be resolved? That would be my first question. Jim Snee : Yes. No, Ben, we don't have any supply issues. Product is -- a lot of the product is actually produced in Mexico. What we are -- I mean what we have is obviously the runoff in the cost of the avocados that's impacted the performance of the business in the short term. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then if we look into Jennie-O, I mean, obviously, it was a significantly better quarter, and thank you very much for elaborating on that. Now if we look forward and all the strategic initiatives you've talked about, how should we think about the level of profitability for Jennie-O going forward? Is it about to get it back to a more, call it, branded food level, in the low to mid-teens? Or is there still going to be somewhat of volatility just because of the commodity piece you won't be able to get rhythm completely? Jim Snee : Yes, Ben, it's a great question. From our point of view, the work that we're doing is being done to eliminate the volatility in the earnings. And so by doing this, we know that we're going to be able to improve the quality of earnings over time and reduce the volatility. And so really, that's how you should think about it. As we're sitting here today, you've got obviously, breast meat prices at significantly higher prices. You've got corn and soy at very high prices. So there's just a lot of moving parts and a lot of volatility. But the big driver, again, the most important thing to take away is that this is going to be a demand-oriented businesses -- demand-oriented business that will have less volatile earnings over time. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : You mentioned the elasticities and how they're holding up. I just want to come back to that and see if you can elaborate on what your assumptions are going forward in your guidance. Do you expect that to continue? Or do you, at least for modeling purposes and guidance, assume it reverts back to more normal levels or something in between? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean right now, Michael. I mean, we expect it to continue because it really is all about supply. And just it goes back to the point about all the noise that's out there in distribution, fill rates, strong demand. And really, until some of those issues work themselves out, it's going to be hard to prognosticate about elasticities. Do we expect there to never be elasticities? Again, no. But what we do know is that we've got to solve -- continue to solve the supply side of the business, and then we'll have a better view on elasticities over time. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. And just also following up on Planters, I certainly appreciate there's some supply disruptions or service levels, you called that out pretty broadly. But I want to make sure I understand, that would seem to impact your shipments and make those worse than the sales growth we see in the scanner data, but our numbers are showing this kind of high single-digit declines or even slightly more in January. Do you see selectively where some regions or retailers are performing better than that on a sell-through basis that you would point to the supply disruptions as how the business is doing better than you think? Or what are your expectations for this level on the high side and it's coming through where you would have expected? Jim Snee : Yes. It's -- like it's a combination of all those things. I mean, we are seeing some retailers who are continuing to perform better. I referenced the other part of the business in foodservice. And then until we had total control of the business, we were expecting some of these disproportionately lower bill rates and then that came to fruition. So it is, it's a little bit of a rethink. What we do know and what we're so optimistic about is having this business under our control, full control operationally, total supply chain, obviously, the sales part. It just allows us to be able to run the business the way that we want to run the business. And then I talked about C-stores and foodservice, but you've also got the club channel that's not included in the scanner data either. So there are parts that aren't in there. And you add that to the supply chain issues, we feel like we've got it under our control. We're ready to continue to drive this business forward. Operator : The next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi, Jim, Jacinth. A couple of questions. This is more backward looking. But the decision to have a Super Bowl ad probably wasn't yours, it was probably by prior management. But typically, you do those ads when you know that retailers can merchandise aggressively around it, you do it for the retailers. But you did at this time at a time of supply chain challenges. Can you talk about whether this ad created the goodwill with retailers you hoped it would? Or did it cause any issues? And then secondly, regarding the assumption on margins getting progressively better, does that assume that your costs kind of level out as the year goes on? Or have you included an assumption of continued inflation throughout the year? Jim Snee : Yes. Thanks, Rob. You're right on the Super Bowl ad, obviously, we had a -- there was a commitment to that work. But I would say that it didn't build any ill will with retailers. Supply disruptions are so broad-based in today's environment. That wasn't an issue. It did accomplish exactly what we wanted it to do in terms of brand building, making sure that we were getting the impressions in the marketplace that we wanted to get. To your point, we were able to get still a lot of display activity. But we would consider the Super Bowl ad a success. And then in regards to margins, we have built in continued inflation throughout the year. We've also built in some continued pricing. As I said, we've got pricing that's built-in process and pricing that's yet to come. That's going to contribute to that margin improvement. Robert Moskow : Okay. And just a follow-up. Does it also assume that your labor issues get sequentially better during the course of the year, too? Jim Snee : Yes. For sure, Rob. Absolutely. We've seen some improvement, but we expect that to continue throughout the year. Operator : The next question is from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Benjamin Bienvenu : I want to ask about the International business, and specific to the M&A strategy that you expect to deploy there. That business has, I know, become a prominent piece of your long-term strategy. Do you expect the opportunity for growth to be driven disproportionately by M&A versus organic growth? And given kind of the debt profile of the business right now and the leverage profile, which is very manageable given the cash flow of the business, how aggressive are you in terms of pursuing M&A in that business at the moment? Jim Snee : Sure, Ben. A couple of questions in there. So we are very optimistic about the international business over the long term. We expect these logistics challenges to be temporary, same with the COVID restrictions that we experienced in China. What we're so optimistic about is the platform that we have built and continue to build across the entire International business. The strongest part of that foundation is in China, where we've been the longest, we've learned a lot about the business, we've added infrastructure and feel like we can continue to leverage what we already have and continue to scale up that business. And not just in China but also throughout Asia Pacific because of what we've done in China. And so we have not backed off at all of our M&A strategy, whether internationally or domestically, to be honest with you. We're continuing to look for those opportunities that fit into the strategic initiatives that I laid out in my prepared remarks. So we know that we have the financial wherewithal. We have the structure in parts of the world where we can do additional M&A. It's all about finding the right opportunity at the right time. And we continue to prospect for those opportunities internationally and domestically. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Great. Revisiting the repositioning of the JOTS business, you characterized the savings, the $20 million to $30 million of savings, I think, is G&A. But it sounds like the breadth of some of the actions you're taking there might extend beyond just G&A savings. Should we think of that $20 million to $30 million as a baseline and incremental rationalization and supply chain savings stacked on top of that? Or would those broader actions be contained within that $20 million to $30 million that you referenced? Jim Snee : You're thinking about it the right way, that, that would be the baseline and there will be additional opportunities. Operator : The next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : Yes. I was hoping to go back to grocery. And obviously, you talked about some of the discrete pressures in that MegaMex and you can kind of see that recent part in the equity earnings line being down year-on-year at the corporate level. But you still have the Planters acquisition contribution in there. So I'm just trying to get a sense on maybe ex MegaMex, ex Planters, there would seem to be a pretty significant year-on-year profit decline implied by the fiscal first quarter results. You talked to especially packaging inflation. But maybe just talk a little bit about the rest of the portfolio, between the canned meats and nut butters and what kind of you're seeing there from a margin perspective and how we should think about that going forward? Jim Snee : Yes. There's a couple of things there, Adam. I mean the first thing is that the demand across the portfolio remains exceptionally strong. And as we've said several times, we cannot fully supply all of that demand. GP had a significant impact in terms of inflation, freight, steel, aluminum, trim, avocado. So it really was across the board and broad-based. The thing that we have done, obviously, is we've taken pricing to offset that. And we've got, again, pricing that's in process and some pricing that we're evaluating that can be yet to come. And so they have had that significant inflationary impact, but the demand across the business remains extremely, extremely strong. Adam Samuelson : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just over in refrigerated, the organic volumes were down on a year-on-year basis. And I imagine there's at least some elements of the new pork supply agreement and having less kind of fresh pork running through that business. But can you help us think about the organic volume trajectory moving forward with some of the new capacity that you have? I'm just trying to think about once we hit a peak on pricing, I mean the way you grow the business, it's got to be volume over time. And I'm just trying to think about how we get there. Jim Snee : Yes. So you're exactly right, Adam. The decline was due to the effect of the new pork agreement. But the biggest driver for us right now is this added capacity. And so we've got our pepperoni capacity that's up and running in Omaha. We've started additional bacon capacity in a number of different locations. We've talked about other projects and building out our co-manufacturing network. And all of those are having a very, very positive impact on Refrigerated Foods because, again, both the retail and foodservice demand remain incredibly, incredibly strong. Operator : The next question is from Eric Larson of Seaport Research Partners. Eric Larson : Yes. So the question -- let me just step back and maybe ask the question on pricing a little differently, Jim. So you were not highlighting specific products that you may or may not have priced. What percentage of maybe grocery revenue still requires further pricing that you may not have taken already? Maybe that's a better way to kind of clarify it. Jim Snee : Yes. I mean -- so look, I just want to make sure I understand the question, Eric. I mean, we've taken pricing on everything. So there's, again, some pricing that's fully implemented. We've got some pricing that's in process. We've got pricing that's yet to come. And then we're still evaluating the need for future pricing. So we're pretty aggressive on the pricing front in GP and Refrigerated Foods. Eric Larson : Okay. Okay. So my follow-up question is, can you give us -- it's a pretty dynamic environment in the meat protein sector with pork. We -- it looks like the USDA is looking for lower hog production this year, maybe 1% to 2%. It looks like maybe you've got really high soy meal costs. So it's farmers -- incentive for farmers to maybe increase production is not as great, at least right now. And maybe some of the Chinese demand might be backing off after a couple of years of really strong demand. So can you kind of give us a feel for how your pork and your hog costs might look for the remainder of the year? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean the biggest thing there, Eric, is they're going to be elevated. For all the reasons that you described, we do expect them to continue to be elevated and we expect them to continue to be volatile. I mean, the other element of this to consider is labor. And we do expect to see continued improvement in labor. But we've talked in the past about raw materials that are impacted by labor and pork trim. And so as we continue to get more labor, we'll be able to do more boning and get more pork trim, but we also know that all the variables you described will have an impact leading us to those higher costs. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I do want to take a moment to recognize Nathan Annis, who is completing his final earnings call as Director of Investor Relations as he transitions into his new role of Vice President of Corporate Development. Nathan has done a great job helping us to evolve our Investor Relations messaging over the last 5-plus years. I know he'll be equally successful in his new role. And replacing Nathan is Dave Dahlstrom, who has been alongside Nathan over the last several years and is well prepared to assume this very important role. I want to personally congratulate both of them as they begin their new assignments. In closing, we remain very optimistic about our business and we are well prepared to navigate the balance of our fiscal 2022. Again, thank you for joining us, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Our team continues to successfully navigate some of the most difficult operating conditions in the company's 130-year history as we again delivered strong top and bottom line growth this quarter. I want to express my gratitude to the entire team for their commitment and ability to drive results. There are many examples across our company of our results matter focus. And I would like to specifically acknowledge 2 teams who showed incredible dedication and determination during the last quarter. First, I want to recognize our Jennie-O Turkey Store team. In March, highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was confirmed in our supply chain. And our team quickly and effectively mobilized into crisis mode. This involved working long hours over the course of many weeks to protect the safety of the turkey flux, provide transparent communication to customers and operators and plan for future business interruptions, all while operating the day-to-day business. This was compounded by severe weather in early May, which also impacted several facilities within the supply chain. Our Jennie-O team went through a lot this quarter, showing unwavering commitment and resolve in the face of some exceedingly demanding situations. I thank them for the work they've accomplished and for the work yet to come. Second, I would like to applaud our team in China for their incredible execution during truly unprecedented times. Strict lockdowns forced the partial closure of 2 of our manufacturing facilities. Some of our team members volunteered to sleep and live inside the facilities for 10 days to ensure the plants remained operational until normal production could resume. Simultaneously, our sales and marketing teams drove outstanding retail sales gains in anticipation of widespread lockdowns. The ingenuity, resourcefulness and grit displayed by our entire team in China was truly commendable and another example of what makes our company uncommon. In the second quarter, our team delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of record sales and third consecutive quarter of earnings growth. Operating margin also improved compared to the first quarter, an indication that our balanced business model are working. Cluster and operator demand for our leading brands remained robust as we continue to realize the benefits of investments in our direct sales force, diversified product portfolios, increased advertising, brand building and innovation. Across all channels, our brands have responded well to managing pricing and promotional levers to ensure the long-term health of our brands and the categories in which they compete. We also made meaningful progress across our supply chain during the quarter, where our investments in capacity and recovery in staffing levels contributed to improved fill rates, inventories and production volumes. One of our most important strategies has been to create a balanced, flexible and diversified business model, able to withstand market volatility and business fluctuations and other unforeseen events. As our second quarter and first half results clearly demonstrate, our strategy to bring balance into our business continues to differentiate Hormel Foods from others in the industry. One of the ways we do this is through our channel diversification. In the initial stages of the pandemic, we leaned heavily on our retail businesses, both domestically and internationally, to drive growth. In the current environment, we are growing with the foodservice industry through its recovery and continuing to meet elevated demand at retail. From a top line perspective, we drove 15% growth from our retail businesses in the second quarter and continued to see elevated demand for our leading brands, including WHOLLY, SKIPPY, Hormel, Square Table refrigerated entrees, SPAM, Hormel Gatherings, Jennie-O, Columbus and Applegate. We are also seeing our investments in the e-commerce channel pay dividends, with solid above category sales growth and share gains. As measured by IRI, sales increased 5% for the quarter, ending with a strong April. E-commerce constitutes around 12% of our tracked retail sales and is an important part of our future growth. We demonstrated our leadership position in the foodservice channel again during the second quarter, driving sales growth of 32% compared to last year. Growth was extremely balanced, with strength in both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store. We have made substantial gains in the fast-growing convenience store channel, in large part due to the scale the Planters brand brings to our company. Growth from the Planters and core nuts businesses in this channel is enabling expanded placements of other products. Recent wins in the retail and snacking space include SPAM, Chili, SKIPPY peanut butter, Compleats, Black Label bacon and egg bite, Columbus snack trays, Justin's items and Hormel Gatherings party trays. Additionally, we've placed premium foodservice items such as AUSTIN BLUES barbecue, FIRE BRAISED Meats and Bacon 1 pre-cooked bacon to be used in prepared items in this channel. Like e-commerce and the retail channel, convenience stores provide an important part of our future growth in foodservice. Internationally, we are continuing to make progress to bring even more balance to the company. Our business in China is a great example of this. This quarter, we again experienced demand softness in foodservice due to the country's COVID-related restrictions. Our team quickly pivoted its resources from foodservice to the retail channel. Sales of SPAM and SKIPPY surged. And our team was also able to effectively redirect foodservice items to food security programs to help supply those experiencing lockdowns. Mainstream to premium, both domestically and internationally is a strategy that has served us well and will continue to serve us well into the future. From an earnings perspective, our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had an outstanding quarter, as its ability to adjust to current market conditions and meet strong results. Likewise, our foodservice businesses in Refrigerated Foods were able to price for inflation and deliver excellent volume growth. These businesses more than offset higher freight expenses for all segments and the earnings decline in grocery products, which absorbed significantly higher costs for certain inputs, such as avocados, protein and packaging. We have announced another round of pricing actions across our grocery portfolio to help mitigate these inflationary pressures, but will, in the meantime, lean into our balanced model as we did this past quarter. The balanced business model has been a key driver behind our recent success and our long-term growth. We remain confident in our ability to withstand volatile economic conditions and market cycles through our continued focus on balance. We successfully completed the integration of all aspects of the Planters snack nuts business during the second quarter, and the business continues to perform at the high end of our expectations. During the cutover period in February, we experienced lower fill rates as we fully transitioned inventory into our logistics network and assumed control of the entire supply chain. While this did have a short-term impact on sales and consumption, we have seen improvements in customer service levels and expect consumption data to show continued improvement in the coming months. As we celebrate one year of owning the Planters business, I am proud of the excellent progress we have made on our commitments from last June. We have invested heavily behind the Planters and core nuts brands. We are on track to capture the synergies identified during diligence. And we have leveraged this business to amplify our scale in snacking and entertaining. After an excellent first quarter and significant profit growth in the second quarter, our Jennie-O Turkey Store team is facing an uncertain period ahead due to the impacts and risks to its supply chain from HPAI. Similar to what we experienced in 2015, HPAI is expected to have a meaningful impact on industry poultry supplies over the coming months, including large supply gaps in the Jennie-O Turkey Store vertically integrated supply chain beginning in the third quarter. On a positive note, it appears that the biosecurity measures the company has implemented since 2015 have provided additional protection against the virus, as the number of company-managed turkeys impacted to date is 25% lower than during the Breast meat prices have already risen to levels higher than any point in 2015, currently trading above $6 compared to the previous all-time high of $5.85. We have seen increases in other turkey markets as well. From a cost perspective, feed prices are significantly higher, with corn and soybean meal up more than 125% and 40%, respectively, as of early May. Additionally, there is further upside risk to feed prices with later plantings due to cold and wet weather across the Midwest this spring. The cost of production labor at company manufacturing facilities has also increased more than 50% on average compared to 2015. Our team is taking the appropriate actions to protect the health of the turkeys across our supply chain, managing through operational challenges caused by the outbreaks and adapting to changing business conditions. While simultaneously managing through the impacts of HPAI, our team made progress on the Jennie-O Turkey Store business transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the Benson Avenue facility and successfully transferred approximately 200 employees to the newer and larger manufacturing facility in Willmar. We remain on track to integrate business functions, consolidate the Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain into the broader Hormel Foods One supply chain and drive SG&A cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million annually by fiscal 2023. Above all, the team is focused on creating a business model that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators to drive long-term sustainable growth. I also want to provide an update on the great work our team is doing to fulfill our ESG commitments and achieve our 20 by '30 goals. During the second quarter, we announced we are on track to match 100% of domestic energy use with renewable sourcing by the end of 2022. We announced that our Justin's brand is transitioning to jars that use 30% less plastic. We were ranked #57 on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Fortune 500 list of the largest green power users. We were named One of America's Most Trustworthy Companies by Newsweek. And in May, for the 13th time, we were named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL Media. This ranking recognizes outstanding environmental, social and governance transparency and performance. We are proud and honored to continue to be named a top corporate citizen. Lastly, I want to share a recent success story from our Inspired Pathways Free Community College Program. This week, we hired the first individuals from the program to participate in paid summer internships. This marks yet another example of why we believe this program can be generational for our employees, their dependents and for the future of the company. We are reaffirming our sales guidance range of net sales between $11.7 billion and $12.5 billion and narrowing the earnings range of $1.87 to $1.97 per share. We are confident in our ability to deliver our sales guidance given robust demand for our brands across the retail, foodservice and international channels, improvements in our supply chain, investments in capacity and from strategic pricing actions. From an earnings perspective, we expect a strong finish to the year from our Refrigerated Foods business. We anticipate a fourth quarter improvement from pricing actions taken across our Grocery Products portfolio. We are navigating the impact of HPAI on the Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain and external factors affecting the International and Other segment, including current export logistics challenges and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Our teams have actions in place to manage through these challenges and drive results for the company. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss financial information relating to the quarter and provide more color on key drivers to our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of record sales of $3.1 billion, a 19% increase compared to last year. Organic sales increased 10%. Gross profit increased $77 million compared to last year, a 16% increase. This improvement was driven by strength in Jennie-O Turkey store, growth from Refrigerated Foods, the addition of the Planters snack nuts business and strategic pricing actions to offset inflationary pressures. Gross profit margin was 17.9% compared to 18.3% last year and 17.7% in the first quarter. SG&A expenses increased 12% compared to last year due to the addition of the Planter snack nuts business and higher advertising investments in our brand. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased to 7.3% from 7.7% last year. This speaks to our continued strong sales growth and disciplined cost management. We increased advertising investments in the second quarter to support the Planters, Columbus and SPAM brand. For the quarter, advertising expense increased by 27% or approximately $0.01 per share. Operating income increased 16% to $335 million. Operating margins were 10.8% compared to 11.1% last year. Operating margin increased sequentially from 10.5% in the first quarter. As anticipated, we delivered quarter-over-quarter improvement in operating margin and made continued progress in mitigating the significant inflation we experienced. Interest and investment income declined $9 million primarily due to lower results from our rabbi trust, which generally tracks with equity market. Interest expense increased $7 million compared to last year. Our effective tax rate was 18.7% for the quarter, down from 22.1% for the same period last year. The lower rate this quarter was primarily due to tax benefits from increased stock option exercises. Our effective tax range guidance of 20.5% to 22.5% is unchanged from the prior outlook. The net result of all these factors was diluted earnings per share of $0.48, a 14% increase over $0.42 last year. Turning to cash flows. Operating cash flow for the second quarter increased 24% to $193 million. Operating cash flow for the first half of 2022 increased 60% to $577 million. Strong earnings growth has been a key catalyst to these increases. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $78 million compared to $45 million last year. During the quarter, we benefited from new capacity, including our pepperoni expansion at Papillion Foods plant in Nebraska and raw bacon investment in our plant in Austin. Our fiscal 2022 target for capital expenditures is unchanged at $310 million. We paid our 375th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15 at an annual rate of $1.04 per share. We did not repurchase any shares during the first half. We will repurchase shares opportunistically based on our internal valuation. We expect to make our first payment and begin our deleveraging related to Planters acquisition in the back half of the year. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and deleveraging to 1.5x to 2x EBITDA by 2023. Turning to our segment results. Segment profit increased by 15% as growth in Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Foods more than offset declines in Grocery Products and International and Other. The company benefited from Planters sale of $239 million in the quarter and the related profit contribution. Refrigerated Foods volume declined 13% and organic volume decreased 14%. The decline in volume was primarily due to our strategic decision to restructure a pork supply agreement, reducing our exposure to low-margin commodity pork business and better aligning resources to value-added growth. Sales increased 13% and organic sales increased 11%. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 3%. Refrigerated Foods saw meaningful improvement in many areas across the supply chain due to improved labor availability and additional production capacity, helping to offset production constraint. Grocery Products volume increased the Planters business. Organic volume increased 2% Segment profit declined 9% as organic sales growth and the addition of Planters snack nuts business was unable to offset considerable inflationary pressures and lower results from MegaMex. Jennie-O Turkey Store had another excellent quarter, with sales up 16% and segment profit up nearly 400%. Higher commodity prices and improved foodservice sales drove the substantial improvement in segment profit. HPAI had an immaterial impact on the segment's results for the second quarter. For the International and Other segment, volume was down 14% and organic volume declined 15%, due in large part to lower commodity sales associated with the company's new pork supply agreement. Segment profit declined 3% as profit growth in China did not overcome lower results from the export business. We continue to battle extreme input cost volatility and inflation. We have seen increases across all our input, including raw materials, packaging and supplies, freight and logistics and labor. We expect a stabilization as demand and supply come more into balance and anticipate certain costs, such as labor, to be more structural in nature. Protein markets have generally remained elevated and above a year ago and historical levels. For context, pork prices as measured, by the USDA composite cutout, were 6% higher in the second quarter compared to last year and more than 30% higher than the 5-year average. We have seen similar dynamics across beef and chicken markets and witnessed an acceleration in the turkey market during the quarter due to the emergence of HPAI. Feed also continues to be highly inflationary. Our hedging program at Jennie-O Turkey store has effectively helped us manage risk near term. Looking to the back half of the year, we expect protein and feed costs to remain volatile and elevated compared to historical level. Costs for packaging and supplies are up double-digits on average over last year and accelerated during the most recent quarter. Trucking freight is also up significantly on both an absolute and per volume basis. This is being driven by volatility in the spot market and soaring diesel fuel prices. While we're noticing some relief in spot markets in the third quarter, increased fuel surcharges are partially offsetting this benefit. Ocean freight rates and export logistics continue to challenge our international team. Labor shortages have been underpinning the inflation we have seen across many of our inputs and in our own facilities. We continue to see positive trends in staffing levels, which has allowed us to increase production in important product lines, such as SPAM, raw bacon and pizza toppings. Inefficiencies related to new team members and turnover continued to impact operation, but we expect improvement in the back half of the year. As labor recovers across the industry-wide supply chain, we expect fewer upstream and downstream challenges. Our experienced management team has done an excellent job managing profitability in the face of these challenges through strategic shifts in product mix, disciplined management of SG&A and driving efficiencies through our one supply chain. As Jim mentioned, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2022 sales guidance and narrowing our earnings guidance range. For Refrigerated Foods, we expect a strong finish to the year, led by continued strength in the foodservice businesses and strong demand for retail products. Our Grocery Products business will continue to be challenged by inflationary pressures until the recently announced pricing actions for this segment becomes effective in the fourth quarter. Given the uncertainty regarding HPAI and based on our current expectations, Jennie-O Turkey Store sales volumes are expected to decline approximately 30% in the back half of the year due to supply gaps in its vertically integrated supply chain. With the third quarter representing the seasonal earnings low for this business, we expect third quarter earnings to be in line with last year. The International and Other segment continues to see strong demand, both in its export business and in China. However, due to the impact of 2 partial plant shutdowns in China as a result of COVID-related restrictions and persistent export logistic challenges, there remains a risk to earnings growth in the back half of the year. Across our retail businesses, we expect continued strong demand and anticipate improvements in fill rates, assortment and its strategic promotional activity to mitigate potential downside of elasticities. We continue to see strong momentum in the foodservice channel, with demand for many items outpacing our ability to supply. This strong demand, coupled with supply chain improvement, give us of confidence in our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth in the second half of the year. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Jack Hardin : Yes. This is Jack Hardin, subbing in for Ben Bienvenu. You touched on the volume impact, but on HPAI, would you -- your margin benefits on the back side of HPAI next year just like we saw in 2015? Jim Snee : Yes. Jack, thanks for the question. We've spent a lot of time over the last several years working on our jobs business. We know we've got a a fantastic brand. We've been doing a lot of work to continue to build a stronger business model that leverages our entire enterprise. And we had a strong finish to 2021, a great first half. We've got uncertainty in the back half of 2022. And we are going to begin to repopulate those farms. And we're going to return the supply in a very safe and timely manner. And so we know that the demand is there for the product. And as supply comes back in line, we expect strong demand across retail and foodservice. What we've tried to highlight were a couple of the differences in terms of what's changed since 2015 when we think about feed costs, when we think about labor costs. But I think the most important thing for us is that as we get supply ramped back up, we know that the demand is going to be there, both in the retail channel and the foodservice channel, because of the work that we've done. And as markets stay strong and if markets are better, that opportunity certainly exists. Operator : The next question is from Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez of Barclays. Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez : Congrats on the results. The question is regarding mostly the situation in China. Has it started to recover, if it\u2019s slowly opening and if it\u2019s still too early to tell? Jim Snee : Yes. So Antonio, thanks for the question. Again, the work that we've done to develop our business in China has been really, really successful as we've been able to build out a very balanced and strong business model, both on the retail and foodservice side of the business. If we go back to 2020, at the outset of a pandemic, when really China led the way in terms of shutting down and some of the current -- some of the similar dynamics that they're facing today, the business behaved much like it is today. We saw a slowdown in foodservice, a ramp-up in retail. But then as thins got back to somewhat normal, we saw a return in our foodservice business. And so, having that near-term experience that we would expect to see our business return to a very strong growth trajectory. That being said, knowing that we're dealing with these 2 partial shutdowns that really will have more of an impact in our Q3, there may be some short-term impact on the China business. But really, there's absolutely no change in our long-term outlook. Very confident in the business, and very strong demand in all aspects of it. Operator : The next question is from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : So on the price, the inflation on Grocery, can you talk about if you're taking the pricing that you're taking? Does that cover all your expenses and your inflation? And have you seen any pushback from any of your retailers? And then lastly on this is, what is your demand elasticity across your portfolio? And which products have the least and which ones have the most? Jim Snee : Yes, Ken. So this round of pricing in GP will cover down our costs, our expenses. And as you know, I mean, we are very, very thoughtful about the managing of our pricing and promotions to ensure the long-term health of our business. And we always take a long-term view, because as we said in our comments, in our press release, we know that we have a responsibility to our customers, to our consumers and to the categories. In regards to pushback, what I would say is that really the pricing dynamics haven't changed. We've always had case and have strong justification for why a price increase is necessary.  I would say that what has changed is probably that we're all -- retailers and manufacturers, we're all experiencing the same broad-based inflation. And even though that's the case, I mean, it still doesn't make conversations any easier because we're all going for the same thing. And that's that responsibility to protect the equity of the brand and the business. And then I would say, in terms of pricing, the brands or the categories that we've seen the most impact on, and this is the price increase impact, would be SPAM because of our protein inputs and some of our packaging costs and then WHOLLY Guacamole because of avocados and then really least impacted would be SKIPPY. SPAM and WHOLLY have both -- as you look at the data, they both held up incredibly well in the face of some pretty strong pricing actions. So hopefully, that gives you some clarity. Jacinth Smiley : And yes, just to add to -- yes, I just wanted to add to Jim's comment. I mean, this portfolio does very well during these slowdowns. And we're currently leaning into advertising in our key brands like SPAM and Planters and really expect to continue to see strong growth as we're seeing with -- in the face of all this inflation and negatively impacting the bottom line. But there is still very strong top line growth in consumption. Data continues to be very positive with double-digit growth in many of our key categories. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Just want to follow up on that train of thought a little bit with consumer trading. Maybe not elasticity exactly. But just curious what you've seen historically with down trading. Just since I think you just mentioned you see some benefit. But how do you balance or what tends to be the net result of maybe down trading to some products from, say, beef to perhaps pork or SPAM or something like that versus some of the color we heard from Walmart the other day, where they were calling out down trading to private label in some categories like bacon and deli and lunch meat that are, of course, very big ones for you? Is it typically a net positive even with all those moving parts? Can you just maybe call out what some of the biggest moving pieces are there? Jim Snee : Yes. It's a great question. I know a conversation we'll be having as we continue to head into the -- or face some of these economic challenges. But I think the key takeaway for us is this balance that we've continued to build across all of our business. And as we think about our portfolio, we've got such an incredibly wide range of offerings when we think about the value consumer. And that's where Jacinth talks about our GP portfolio that historically has done well during slowdowns. And this quarter, we've been able to demonstrate great top line growth, great volume growth. Now we just have to get caught up on some of the inflationary factors. But as you think about that balance across consumer type, across channel, across products, across brands, we're able to navigate these environments really, really well. And while we're talking about the value consumer, I mean, the thing to remember is that we still have premium consumers and premium offerings that are doing incredibly well. The strength of our Columbus business, when we think about entertaining and snacking, when we see the continued strength of our Applegate business, which is more of a food forward type brand and product line. And then it all goes back to really the balance that we've built across the portfolio that sets us up incredibly well for so many different economic conditions. Michael Lavery : That's really helpful. And can I just do a follow-up on your guidance? Jim, you called out the responsibility to protect the equity of your brands as the lead off to that text. And its language, I don't think, I've seen before. And just was curious if there's some significance to that, we should make sure that we understand. It looks like the advertising spending in the quarter was up, but probably maybe a lift from Planters. Is it a big factor in how you think about the outlook? What's the weight of those of -- of that remark? Jim Snee : Yes. I would say there's not really a dramatic change. It really is just a call out in terms of what we do. We've talked a lot about the strength of our brands and the investments that we make in our brands every year. And that is our responsibility. It's something that we believe is a differentiated capability for us as we think about brand stewardship. And so -- and it's also about the recognition that we have a responsibility to our brands. We understand that there are others in the channel that we have an obligation to as well to make sure that we're taking care of our customers, that we're taking care of our consumers. And even in our foodservice business, we've got to take care of our operators to make sure that we're servicing their needs and providing great value. But again, all of it goes back to this long-term view that we always take is to make sure that, yes, we have to run the business for today. But we want to make sure that we have long-term healthy businesses, long-term healthy categories. Jacinth Smiley : And I'll just add. It's just having that -- again, that long-term view, but maintaining that stickiness that we have with our ultimate consumers and not really doing anything in our mind that would really destroy that brand equity that we have built up over time with our consumer base. Operator : The next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : This is Bryan, considering for the honeymooning Pete Galbo. And hopefully, I don't screw this up. I think he may be listening. So a couple of questions. First, just you mentioned a little bit in terms of the earnings phase in. Can we just get a little bit more color? I think typically, the margins in the third quarter are lower sequentially than the second quarter. So is that still kind of the pacing? Would we have that normal sort of seasonality in margins as we move through the back half of the year? And I guess, as we're thinking about earnings effectively being flat year-over-year, how much of that is seasonality? How much of that is, I guess, the mismatch or beginning to match up your pricing versus covering your inflation? So just trying to understand some of the moving parts in terms of the phasing as we look through the third quarter and fourth quarter. Jim Snee : Yes. It's a great question. Bryan, you didn't mess that up. Nice job. So for us, as we've talked about this year at the first quarter, we were expecting some sequential margin improvement throughout the year. So the impact this year is really what's going to happen with Jennie-O in the third quarter. So that is a big factor. The other thing is our mix, right? Our mix does change in our third quarter. And then like I said, the jobs impact will be a significant impact. And then as we get into the fourth quarter, we'll continue to have strong business in Refrigerated Foods. We've got still some uncertainty in jobs, but we expect that to perform better. And then the big driver is the Grocery Products pricing that we talked about, which will take hold in the fourth quarter. Bryan Spillane : Okay. So sequentially, margins will be down 3Q to 2Q, like they normally would be, and then there's these other pressures. And then we would see it sort of begin to catch up more in the fourth quarter. That's roughly the way to think about it, both at the gross and I guess, EBITDA margin line? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. Jim Snee : That's correct. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then just on -- a follow-up is, I know we've talked a little bit about elasticity on this call and trade up, trade down. Can you give us a sense of just how you're looking at maybe the -- just planning maybe cross elasticity between channels? And I guess what I'm after is, with inflation being as pronounced as it is for the consumer, you're beginning to see some choices that they're making about discretionary versus nondiscretionary spending. So running -- spending on food but not buying discretionary items or general merchandise, let's say, in Walmart. So I guess as you're planning your business forward for what we would expect to be a more inflationary period in general, would your expectation be that there's going to be a little bit of a shift away from foodservice and into grocery or within foodservice within channels? Just generally, how you're kind of thinking about that in the context of inflation going to be with us for a while and consumers will have to start making some discretionary choices? Jim Snee : Yes. Brian, it is one of the things obviously that we watch very closely. We talk a lot about the strength and the competency of our foodservice business, our food service, direct selling organization, the incredible portfolio that we've built over the last several decades. And so we know that our -- we're well positioned to support the foodservice industry with all of their needs that they have. Top of mind, of course, is labor. But specifically to your question, as we're watching these dynamics, and intuitively, you would say with all of the soaring inflation and soaring gas prices, that what you described would take place. But as we think about what we're hearing with flight bookings, what we're hearing about lodging bookings, what we are seeing and hearing from restaurant reservations is that, certainly in the short term, and I think even beyond that, we're going to continue to see... Operator : We are going to reconnect the speakers. Please continue to hold. Hello, everyone. The speakers have been reconnected. Please go ahead. Jim Snee : Yes. So Bryan, I believe I got cut off in the middle of my response to your second question. Bryan Spillane : I promised, Pete, I wouldn't screw this up, and I apparently broke the line, so. Jim Snee : Well, that's what we said in private, but we weren't going to say that publicly. You did. But really, we're -- I think the key takeaway here is we're well positioned as the foodservice business may shift from segment to segment within the channel. And then just on a broader basis, we don\u2019t see any short term slowdown in the foodservice business. We do think there is still incredible pent-up demand and we are able to take advantage of it. The one thing I did talk about was, as individuals may change the way they travel, if they're not flying because of airlines prices and they begin to drive even though fuel prices are higher, the C-store channel is an area where we've made tremendous progress in a short period of time. And the acquisition of Planters has really helped us both in the retail aspect but the foodservice or the takeaway food aspect of the convenience store channel. So that was -- that's the shorter version of my long answer. Operator : The next question is from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : Maybe just to start off, if I could clarify the comment about third quarter earnings being in line with last year. There was the unusual cost. So you had kind of 2 earnings numbers a year ago, the $0.32 and the $0.39. When you're talking about in line with last year, to which last year are you referring? Jacinth Smiley : Last -- we're referring to the GAAP numbers, which is $0.39, right, which is the adjusted [39th] week. Thomas Palmer : Okay. And then maybe to follow up on Ken's question on Grocery Products segment, just the pricing. So can I just clarify? Is the pricing -- were you able to fully offset the inflation that you are currently seeing with that pricing? And then you mentioned the fourth quarter kind of being the impact in terms of that pricing flowing through. Should we think about it as the pricing flows through during the fourth quarter? And therefore, you have even added impacts when we think about the first quarter of fiscal '23? Or is this -- it flows through? And in part during the third quarter, the fourth quarter reflects kind of the full benefits? Jim Snee : No. We would expect the effect or the benefit will take -- will have an impact. It will be right at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. And so naturally, of course, that will flow into the first quarter of '23. But the full fourth quarter will be impacted in a positive way. Thomas Palmer : Okay. And that is you were able to secure pricing that essentially addresses the inflation that you were seeing at the time of those negotiations? Jim Snee : That's correct. Operator : The next question is from Eric Larson of Seaport Research Partners. Eric Larson : So Jim, I'm kind of curious. I'm going back to 2015, the last AI breakout. You've said that your impact -- your bird impact was 25% less than net impact in 2015. But I think one of the things in 2015 that hurt you pretty badly was that you were a net buyer of supply, so that you could meet your demand and those high spot prices really hurt your numbers. And then it took quite a while to kind of repopulate those grown houses, those birds take longer to grow out. So -- and maybe I'm missing it. It sounds like maybe that's not going to be as big a deal this time? Or when should we expect to see the volumes actually start recovering as you kind of repopulate to grow all houses? Jim Snee : Yes. So Eric, thanks for the question. And the comparisons to 2015 are never perfect. So when we say we're down 25%, right, we are talking about our company-owned facilities. Your other question about us buying meat, and that we are not currently buying meat this year. And then again, let's just think about the timing, which is usually 26 weeks. And so we've started some repopulation when you think about when the event started. So the volume will get better in Q4, but still down compared to normal. And then assuming that we don't have any more outbreaks from this event or that we don't see a reoccurrence in the fall, we would expect again to have more traditional volumes available in Q1. Eric Larson : Okay. So then the second follow-up to this whole thing is, so did you decide -- in 2015, one of your actions, given what happened with AI, to actually increase your increase your internal production so you don't have to buy outside supplies? Or did you -- are you converting more of the commodity stuff to -- so what is the change between being a net buyer of supply outside of your company to being right now you're not buying product? So I'm just trying to figure out what the dynamic is there. Jim Snee : Sure, sure, sure. So the 2 biggest drivers really is we think about the supply side of the business. One is feed cost, which is significantly higher today. And then we have had significant SKU rationalization. So as we think about the work that we're doing in this transformation of jobs to make sure that we've got a stronger business model, we have rationalized a number of different SKUs that have made us far less dependent on outside meat purchases. Operator : The next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I came a little late to this call so I apologize if you've kind of addressed this already. But maybe you could tell me like the timing of the Grocery price increases, you're saying it's starting in July really. Were those negotiated like a couple of months ago or very recently? Like how long did it -- is it take -- did it take for that kind of negotiation to get implemented in the marketplace? And then with -- given what we've heard from Walmart, is there -- I'm sure you've answered this already. But do you expect any pushback on future price increases in processed meats categories given that they kind of called them out by name? Jim Snee : Yes. Rob, we talked a little bit, but happy to revisit that. Yes. The pricing that we're talking about has been negotiated recently. And as you know, we do have in our GP portfolio, that's really 60- to 90-day lag to have our pricing take effect. And so we're in that window, and that's why we're talking about the end of July or the end of Q3. What we talked about earlier in terms of the pricing and the environment that we're in is that really the pricing dynamics haven't changed in regards to the justification that we've had to provide. What we think has changed and what we know everybody is experiencing that same broad-based inflation. So the data is being felt by everyone. And it doesn't make the conversations any easier. So we've had a lot of the same conversations. It's just that everyone is feeling the -- or seeing the same information. And then the other thing that we did talk about was understanding that we've always taken a very thoughtful approach to the management of our pricing and promotions. Because while we have this inflationary environment that we're in, we need to ensure the long-term health of our brands. And so that's how this has played out in terms of the pricing for GP. And then that's how we're thinking about the actual pricing environment that we're in. Jacinth Smiley : And I just want to -- this is Jacinth. I just want to clarify my answer to Tom. Our adjusted GAAP EPS number in Q3 of last year was $0.39 less Planters, one-timer. That is what we're comparing to. And we expect to be in line to be better than that in Q3. Operator : The next question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Arthur Almeida : This is Arthur filling in for Adam this morning. I was just wondering if you could help us think about how you're thinking about maintaining branded retail placements throughout this, let's call it, a difficult period. And if you could just help us, how has demand elasticity evolved from the time we last spoke? Jim Snee : Yes. Sure. So Arthur, I mean the placement of our products remains very, very strong and continues to get better as our supply chain improves. We're able to improve the assortment of our products, the mix. And as our supply chain and our capacity continues to get better, we are able to engage in select promotional activity as well. So from a distribution perspective, it continues to be strong and getting better as our supply chain continues to recover. As we think about elasticity, there is still a lot of noise in terms of fill rates, assortment, promo, really getting some of the second and third tier items back on the shelf from the impact of the pandemic. And so I mean, we're watching that very closely. But we still see lots of noise in the system for the balance of the year. And our brands have responded well to that pricing. So we're going to continue to support them with advertising and promotion. And we've got any potential impact factored into the guidance that we've provided for the back half of the year. Operator : The next question is from Carson Barnes of Consumer Edge. Carson Barnes : Can you touch on the labor issues a bit and discuss what you're doing to mitigate those impacts from a product mix perspective? And then how are you thinking about correcting those issues longer term? Jim Snee : Yes. Carson, thank you. I mean as we go back several years and the work that we've done to create our one supply chain and really leverage the strength of the enterprise is one of the key factors that's allowed us to navigate this incredibly difficult operating environment. Since we last talked, we have seen meaningful improvement in our supply chain since the end of January. And those improving labor trends have really helped in terms of our improved production, the building of some inventory, improvement of fill rates. And that has had a very positive impact on our business. So that being said, while we're continuing to get better with labor within our own facilities, we continue to see upstream and downstream challenges. And those challenges are significant on a weekly basis, whether it could be a packaging or ingredient headwind or when it comes to freight, ability to get product into and out of ports, that impacts our international business, that is still a very real constraint for us that hasn't cleared yet. So we feel good about the work that we've done to improve our supply chain. There's still some upstream and downstream things that need to clear. But as that labor gets better, we expect that to mitigate over time. Operator : The next question is from Rebecca Scheuneman of Morningstar. Rebecca Scheuneman : So first of all, you had said that demand has remained strong in the face of inflation. But volumes were quite a bit weaker than we expected. Could you maybe help quantify what the impact was from the labor constraints? Jim Snee : Yes. Rebecca, the biggest issue in terms of total volume was the reduction in pork supply as we renegotiated our pork supply agreement at the end of last year. Labor was a factor, but I wouldn't say it really was a significant driver. It was really less -- far less than pork in terms of the total impact on the volume. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. Could I be supple just to ask you to quantify the impact of the pork? Jim Snee : Yes. That is something that we've broken out before. And actually, what I probably would do is just so we get you the exact information is we'll have David follow up with you so you've got the exact number of pounds that we've talked about in the past. Rebecca Scheuneman : Okay. Sounds good. And secondly, is it fair to assume that HPAI could maybe delay some of the plant cost savings in jobs? Jim Snee : No. The work that we've done on the transformation of the business has not slowed down. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And if anything, Rebecca, we would say it has actually accelerated some of the work that was already underway to be able to reposition the business and reposition the plant the way we were planning to restructure this business to continue to be very consumer focused and really leaning towards and embracing the trends that we're seeing in the consumer space. And so if anything, it really has been a positive. And we continue to be on track to realize the time line and the savings that we have communicated externally. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Snee for closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of the results our team delivered in the face of an incredibly difficult operating environment. We've spent a lot of time and effort over the years developing a strategic and balanced portfolio for times just like these. And it's our people, our brands and our culture are what gives me confidence in our ability to continue to deliver results. Thanks again, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release and third quarter earnings supplement which can be accessed from our corporate website or located on our investor website, investor.hormelfoods.com. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. With the results we announced this morning, we have successfully achieved seven straight quarters of record sales and four consecutive quarters of earnings growth. In the current environment, this is an especially notable achievement. Over the last 12 months, we have delivered four consecutive quarters of record sales in excess of $3 billion. We've grown diluted earnings per share 15% compared to the trailing 12-month period. We've made considerable progress across our supply chain, including investments in capacity to support high-growth categories and improvement in the staffing levels, production volumes, inventories and fill rates. We've integrated our largest acquisition to-date with the Planters snack nuts business. We began transformational work on the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment while simultaneously managing through the impacts of HPAI. We further de-risked commodity profitability with a new pork supply agreement, we have generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow, and we've increased the dividend for the 56th consecutive year. Our experienced management team has again proven their ability to navigate and grow the business in volatile market conditions. And these results demonstrate that our business is built for growth, our brands remain vibrant and relevant, our strategies remain effective and our inspired team members around the world truly embody our results matter mentality. In the third quarter, we delivered another quarter of record sales and double-digit operating income growth. Our team's execution again played a pivotal role in growth this quarter. As together, we overcame significant challenges, including continued broad-based inflationary pressures, persistent upstream and downstream supply chain disruptions, limited turkey supply and impacts in China from COVID-related restrictions and temporary plant shutdowns. Double-digit operating income growth this quarter was led by outstanding contributions from Jennie-O Turkey Store and Refrigerated Foods. The Jennie-O Turkey Store team significantly outperformed our profit expectations for the quarter as the team effectively managed limited turkey supply and maximized operational performance, all while working to restore the impacted turkey farms across the supply chain. Refrigerated Foods delivered double-digit value-added earnings growth on retail and foodservice items, more than offsetting lower commodity profitability. Similar to prior quarters, our balanced business model was able to offset inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, which were both significant headwinds during the quarter. Most importantly, our performance indicates our brands remain healthy and are generating growth. Consumers and operators have continued to engage with our brands due to their value, convenience and versatility. The team drove volume, sales and share gains at retail for brands such as SKIPPY, Hormel Gatherings, Hormel chili, Dinty Moore and Mary Kitchen. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work and coordinated efforts of the SKIPPY team who supported our customers and the category this past quarter. We continue to drive growth across our premium retail brands for products such as Applegate natural and organic meats and Columbus charcuterie. We also experienced an acceleration across our center store portfolio, which is firmly aligned with the value shopper. The Grocery Products segment delivered strong organic volume and sales growth during the quarter and is well positioned to grow as consumers seek flexibility, versatility and yield at lower price points. Demand for foodservice products remained elevated as well as operators again turn to our items to help mitigate labor pressures and diversify menu offerings. Value-added products such as our premium bacon and sausage, sliced meats and line of premium prepared proteins performed exceptionally well this quarter. We saw great demand for brands, including Austin Blues, Natural Choice, Bacon 1, Cafe H and Old Smokehouse. Regardless of channel, our brands have responded well to the pricing actions we have taken over the past 18 months even as current macroeconomic conditions pressure some of our customers, consumers and operators. The demand environment has remained favorable, especially for food and convenient meal solutions. We have seen this in the positive syndicated data for many of our Grocery and Refrigerated Products and in the momentum behind our branded foodservice items. In some cases, demand is still outpacing our ability to fully supply. Our broad portfolio of products spanning value tiers, eating occasions and channels positions us well. We anticipate some additional impact from elasticities as new pricing actions are reflected in the marketplace and we have accounted for this in our outlook. To date, the impact of price elasticities have been muted by other factors such as distribution and assortment gains, and as we have increased production to drive improved fill rates. Our teams remain keenly focused on the long-term needs of the business, our strategic priorities, and protecting the equity of our brands. Hormel Foods has a history of continuously evolving to become a better, more agile and more balanced global branded food company. In early August, we announced the next step in our strategic evolution, our Go Forward initiative. Effective October 31 of this year, the beginning of fiscal 2023, we will be organizing the business into three empowered segments : retail, foodservice and international. As a result of this initiative, we expect to elevate our clear strategic growth priorities; better align the business to the needs of our customers, consumers and operators; deepen our sales capabilities; simplify our approach to customers and operators; and enable faster decision-making. The three new segments will continue to be supported by the Company's One Supply Chain team and corporate functions. We are a much different company today than we were even a decade ago. Since the acquisition of SKIPPY in 2013, we have shifted to becoming a global branded food company with a food-forward mentality and a growing set of leading brands across channels. This shift has involved a series of intentional and strategic actions, including numerous strategic acquisitions focused on snacking and entertaining, growing our branded leadership positions in retail and foodservice and expanding our geographic footprint.  It includes regular evaluations of the portfolio, which in some cases led to divestitures of businesses where we identified a better long-term owner; includes a rightsizing of our pork supply chain, including the divestiture of two hog harvest facilities and the entry into long-term pork supply agreements. It includes the creation of One Supply Chain, which centralized operations, logistics and sourcing decisions to drive the efficiencies for the total company. The modernization of our technology and e-commerce capabilities, including Project Orion and the creation of the Digital Experience Group and most recently, the transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store, this next step, a new operating model is a culmination of these recent strategic actions. As part of the Go Forward initiative, we will be folding in the important work we've been doing to transform the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. As we said, when we announced the transformational efforts, turkey will continue to play an important role in our company and will contribute to growth in both retail and foodservice. We remain on track to integrate all business functions, combine the Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain into the broader Hormel Foods One Supply Chain and drive SG&A cost synergies of approximately $20 million to $30 million annually by fiscal 2023. Our successful transition to the new strategic operating model is dependent on strong leadership and execution from our teams. As previously disclosed, Deanna Brady, Mark Ourada and Swen Neufeldt will be leading the retail foodservice and international segments, respectively. Each of these leaders has over 25 years of experience with the Company and reputations for delivering results. Under their leadership, we expect to drive sustainable growth in line with our long-term growth goals of 2% to 3% top line growth and 5% to 7% bottom line growth. There has been a tremendous amount of what we've done on this initiative and more work to do in the coming months as we create the Hormel Foods of the future. We will provide more information on Go Forward next week at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference. We will also be releasing recast financial information during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to aid in comparability to historical financial data. Earlier this week, we released our 2021 Global Impact Report, which details how we are advancing corporate responsibility, ESG, and our food journey at Hormel Foods. This is the 16th year we have published a report of this kind. Thanks to the incredible work and dedication of our team members, partners and suppliers, Hormel Foods is making a difference. We remain committed to our mission to be one of the top corporate citizens in the world and encourage you to review the report and the progress we have made to advance efforts through our 20 By 30 Challenge. Our business remains healthy even as we continue to navigate some of the most difficult operating conditions in the Company's 130-year history. Our revised full year guidance reflects both the continued top line strength we expect to see across our business and escalated cost pressures, which are impacting the back half of the year. For the full year, we are increasing our net sales expectations to $12.2 billion to $12.8 billion, and we are lowering our diluted earnings per share guidance range to $1.78 to $1.85 per share. There are two key takeaways from our guidance revision. One, we expect top line strength across our businesses to continue as our portfolio is well positioned for the current macroeconomic climate. And two, an escalation in certain operational, logistical and inflationary costs, which began impacting results in the third quarter, has lowered our earnings expectations for the back half of the year. However, we believe the majority of these cost pressures to be transient in nature and to subside over time. First, from a top line perspective, momentum remains very strong. We are confident in our ability to exceed our previous sales guidance due to strong demand for our foodservice and center store grocery brands, higher turkey markets, and the pricing actions we have taken across the portfolio. Our long-term strategy to meet consumers where they want to eat with a broad portfolio of products has been a key differentiator in the current environment. Second, we expect to absorb incremental costs in the fourth quarter related to certain operational, logistical and inflationary headwinds similar to what we experienced in the third quarter. In terms of magnitude, we view each of these cost buckets similarly. Starting with operational costs, we have made progress across our supply chain over the past year as a recovery in staffing levels has contributed to higher production volumes inventories and fill rates. As we said last quarter, inefficiencies related to new team members and turnover have impacted operations leading to higher costs. We continue to see this pressure in the third quarter and do not expect meaningful improvement for the balance of the year. We are also experiencing higher-than-expected freight and warehousing costs both domestically and for our international business. Freight rates have moderated recently, but this benefit has been more than offset by elevated fuel surcharges and significantly higher warehousing costs. Protein prices on key inputs have remained elevated compared to our expectations and historical averages. While we have mechanisms in place to manage the impact of elevated and volatile protein costs, markets have generally sustained higher price levels for longer than we anticipated in our previous outlook. We believe these cost pressures are transient and likely to subside over the coming quarters. We fully expect our One Supply Chain team to continue to improve over time as our teams effectively onboard, train and retain our new team members while striving to provide a best-in-class workplace experience. This is in addition to the investments we are making in automation and supply chain optimization. We also expect to benefit from the work the team has been doing to control freight expenses and capture the benefits from our recently expanded logistics network. Finally, we are starting to see a relief across key input cost markets that are better aligned to our expectations, which should present the opportunity for margin expansion in the coming quarters. The revision to guidance for the year is disappointing, but we will continue to manage the business for the long term as we navigate these difficult business conditions, leveraging our balanced business model and experienced management team. As I look beyond the fourth quarter, I have a high level of optimism regarding our future. We expect our brands to continue to perform well and plan to introduce an exciting slate of innovation in 2023. We anticipate improvements in our supply chain and the industry-wide supply chain as the broader markets stabilize. We expect turkey supply to normalize, allowing our teams to continue their work to create a demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio. We fully expect our international business to be a significant growth driver for the Company and to benefit from the investments we have made during the year, including the new Asia Pacific Innovation Center. And once implemented, our new strategic operating model will better align the businesses to the needs of our customers, consumers and operators to drive sustainable long-term growth. For all of these reasons and from the inspired work of our 20,000 team members around the world, I could not be more excited for the future of our company. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss financial information relating to the quarter and provide more color on key drivers to the outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Record third quarter sales were $3 billion. Net sales and organic net sales increased 6% and 3%, respectively, compared to last year. Volume for the quarter was 1.1 billion pounds, down 9% compared to last year. Organic volume declined 11%. These declines were in line with our expectations and are attributable to our effort to rationalize lower-margin commodity port volume and lower turkey sales as a result of HPAI. These volume declines generally had strong underlying growth from many of the value-added businesses. Gross profit increased to $83 million compared to last year, a 20% increase. Gross profit margin was 16.7% compared to 14.8% last year. Improvement was driven primarily by strength in Jennie-O Turkey Store and the Refrigerated Foods in addition to strategic pricing actions to help offset inflationary pressures. SG&A expenses declined 2% in the third quarter as we lapped the Planters' acquisition-related expenses last year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for the third quarter decreased to 7.3% from 7.9% last year. We continued to generate strong sales and demonstrate disciplined cost management. We again increased the support for our leading brands. For the quarter, advertising expense increased 21% or approximately $0.01 per share. Advertising expenses have increased 29% year-to-date. Operating income increased 40% to $291 million. On a comparable basis, which removes the impact of Planters one-time costs last year, adjusted operating income increased 17%. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.6% compared to 7.2% last year. Adjusted operating margin was 8.7% last year. The effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, up from 13.3% for the same period last year. Last year's rate reflected the benefit from a large volume of stock option exercises and a one-time foreign tax benefit. Our effective tax rate guidance range of 20.5% to 22.5% remains unchanged. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share of $0.40 represented a 25% increase compared to last year. On a comparable basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. The Company continued to generate consistent and strong cash flows. Operating cash flow for the third quarter increased 143% to $186 million and operating cash flow through the first three quarters increased 74% to $763 million. We paid our 376th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $1.04 per share. This completes the 94th consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $61 million compared to $54 million last year. The fiscal 2022 target for capital expenditures is unchanged at $310 million. We are benefiting from new production capacity we have added to our system over the past year and remain on track to open new capacity for SPAM in the first half of fiscal 2023. Remaining investment grade is a top priority for the Company. Since acquiring Planters business last year, we have grown our cash position and EBITDA. On a net basis, we're now well within the stated goal of 1.5x to 2x EBITDA by 2023. Turning to our segment results for the quarter. Refrigerated Foods volume declined 18% and organic volume decreased 19% compared to last year. As referenced earlier, this anticipated decline in volume was primarily due to lower commodity sales resulting from the Company's new pork supply agreement. Sales increased 2% and organic sales increased 1%. Retail products, such as Applegate, natural and organic needs, Hormel's Gatherings party trays, Hormel Natural Choice sliced meats, Hormel Square Table Hormel entrees and Lloyd's Barbecue products grew volume and sales for the quarter while the Foodservice businesses delivered another excellent quarter. Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 16% driven by strong results from the value-added businesses, more than offsetting higher operational and logistics costs and lower commodity profitability. Grocery Products volume increased 15% and sales increased 25%, led by strong demand across the Nut Butters. Mexican and Simple Meals portfolio and the addition of the Planters business. Organic volume increased 8% and organic sales increased 13%. Organic sales gains were led by products such as SKIPPY Spreads, WHOLLY Guacamole, Hormel Chile, Dinty Moore beef stew and Mary Kitchen hash. Segment profit declined 5% due to the impact from continued inflationary pressures and lower results from MegaMex. Jennie-O Turkey Store delivered another outstanding quarter despite challenges related to HPAI. Volume and sales declines were less than expected and segment profit increased by more than $30 million due to higher commodity prices and foodservice sales. For the International & Other segment, volume was down 11% and organic volume declined 12%. Net sales declined 5% and organic sales fell 6%. Higher global sales of SPAM Luncheon Meat and improved results in Brazil did not overcome an overall decline in export sales and lower sales in China. Export volumes declined because of current export logistics challenge and lower commodity sales due to the Company's new pork supply agreement. Sales in China was negatively impacted by COVID-related restrictions and temporary planned shutdowns. Segment profit declined 9% as growth in China did not offset the impact of lower export sales. We have revised our full year fiscal 2022 sales and earnings guidance ranges. Consolidated net sales are expected to exceed our previous expectations benefiting from continued top line strength and pricing actions implemented across the gross products portfolio at the start of the quarter. We project elasticities to remain below historical levels. From a segment perspective, we anticipate profit growth from the Jennie-O Turkey Store and International & Other and anticipate declines for Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products. As a reminder, all segments benefited from an additional week of sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Jennie-O Turkey Store remains on pace to exceed profit expectations for the year with significant profit growth in the fourth quarter. Sales volumes are projected to decline approximately in the fourth quarter due to continued supply gaps in its vertically integrated supply chain and whole bird sales pulled forward into the third quarter. Further, with the positive cases identified earlier this week in our supply chain, we expect the impact from HPAI to reduce production volume in our turkey facilities through at least the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The International & Other segment anticipates growth in the fourth quarter driven by branded exports and improved profitability in China. Persistent shipping interruptions pose a risk to export sales and profit growth while additional COVID-related restrictions in China could pressure in-country results. Refrigerated Foods expects continued strength in the foodservice business and strong demand for its retail products. Profits will be pressured by higher raw material and operational and logistics costs. Lastly most of products expect improved results sequentially due to strong demand across the business and from pricing actions effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter. As Jim detailed, we continue to battle extreme input cost volatility and inflation during the third quarter and expect this to continue for the balance of the year. Our previous outlook assumed key protein markets to move seasonally lower into the fourth quarter. Given that prices on key inputs remained elevated for the majority of August, we are managing through higher-than-expected inventory costs to begin the quarter. We have seen some relief in these key markets over the past week which, if sustained, would benefit margins in the back half of the fourth quarter. Lower industry-wide turkey supplies are expected to keep prices higher near term. Breast meat prices set a record in the third quarter and have yet to moderate. Our team has done an exceptional job managing through disruptions caused by HPAI. We continue to see increased hiring and applicant flow at our production facilities. Inefficiencies and elevated production costs related to newer team members, turnover, absenteeism and overtime, have affected operations but should ease over time. Investments in value-added capacity are paying off strategically, including our pepperoni expansion in Omaha, new bacon lines at the Austin facility and the addition of co-manufacturing partners to support multiple product lines. We expect freight and warehousing costs for the domestic and international businesses to remain elevated, and our One Supply Chain team is actively looking for ways to drive efficiencies and control costs. In closing, I am excited for the next step in our evolution as a global branded food company, the Go Forward initiative. This will create greater focus on our six strategic priorities, better align our business to the needs of our customers, consumers and operators and position us well to drive sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Rupesh Parikh : I want to start with the longer-term question, and I'm guessing this may have to wait until next week. But with your Go Forward initiative, which segments do you think will see the greatest impact from the structure change? Jim Snee : Yes, I mean so obviously, the biggest impact is going to happen in our Retail segment. And that's really the segment that we're excited about all of them. But as we think about the opportunities for us to really accelerate progress on our six strategic priorities, that's the one that's going to have the biggest impact. So really being able to align the operating model with the strategic initiatives in a bigger way than we ever have before is really going to be exciting. Foodservice will have some impact as we move our -- some of our affiliated business in there and then also move the Jennie-O foodservice business in there. It will strengthen us in certain channels or segments like K-12. International will be the least impacted of all the three. So, really retail, then foodservice and then international. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe one additional question. I'm not sure -- same thing, I'm not sure if you guys can comment on it. But if you look towards next year, like any early puts and takes on the operating margin line? I'm just trying to get a sense just given all the moving parts on your Jennie-O, some of the cost pressures whether you think you can actually expand operating margins versus your current guidance for this year? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean it's early to look into 2023. I mean as we're thinking about it, so far, we expect that our brands will continue to perform well in face of pricing. We talked about some of the innovation that we'll be able to bring to the marketplace as supply chain improves. We do expect to see some supply chain improvements. We talked about some of the operational challenges that we've had with new labor turnover, some variances that we hadn't planned for. We know that we've got to get better on that side. So, there's certainly going to be opportunities for us in 2023, also a recovery in our International segment as we think about maybe lockdowns of not being as frequent in China, exports being able to pick up. And then we do expect a benefit from our Go Forward initiative as we think about how we can really accelerate the progress on our six priorities. Operator : And our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Ben Theurer : I actually wanted to elaborate a little bit, and you alluded to it on the sensitivities. So I want to understand if you could share a few more details and between the volume performance versus the pricing performance because it really feels pricing was a big driver during the quarter. Volume down, I get it in Refrigerated just because of like the change in the business model. But then, obviously, if we put it all together, it feels like volume was a little more under pressure. Would you assign this to certain elasticities because of the pricing actions? And how do you think you're going to be able to recover some of the volume over time if we look into fiscal '23? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean as we think about the business spend, clearly, really pleased with the overall health of the business and the performance in the quarter. You touched on it. We knew we were going to have some Refrigerated volume declines. Jennie-O clearly had volume declines tied to HPAI. Our Grocery Products business had strong volume growth. As you dig into some of the specific brands and categories, I would say probably the most softness we have was in the area of bacon, and a lot of that would be tied to the belly market and some of the escalated pricing that we saw throughout the quarter. Ben Theurer : Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up, if I may, on the new operating model, and obviously, we can explore this more in detail next week. But if we kind of -- and you said it about the importance of it, and we've seen, obviously, retail performing year-to-date relatively strong, up 12%, but foodservice even more. Can you give us a little bit of preview in terms of like the distribution of these segments in terms of relevance? It clearly feels like retail is like most likely more than 50% of it. And that's why this is the most focus where you're most excited about, correct? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, obviously, retail will be roughly about 60%. We've talked about foodservice in total being just over 30% and international high single digits. So we're excited about all of them. And really, when we talk about retail being the most impacted, it's because we are bringing together our retail refrigerated, our grocery products unit, our Jennie-O retail. So you do have the most change occurring there. But we also have the most opportunity to really generate the alignment that we need. And so a perfect example of that, I believe, is when we've talked about entertaining and snacking in a bigger way, being a strategic priority for our organization. Historically, we've had pepperoni and refrigerated retail. We've had our gatherings party trays in our deli organization. We've had, of course, now Planters in our grocery products' organization. And now the ability to bring those together under one pillar and really talk to customers and consumers in a way that we haven't before really excites us for the future. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And just a quick add there, Ben. Jim described all of that from a strategic standpoint, if you think about how we go to market as well, what this model actually does, it really just bolster how we go to market as a company and just bringing that one Hormel to bear, and that's truly going to be a strategic advantage for us. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Zaslow : My first question is on SKIPPY, with all the volume that was created there, where does the profit go to? It seemed like there would be a greater association with the increased opportunity created there. Did you guys have co-packers? Was there a shortfall of supply? It just seems like there was a lot of top line but didn't really translate to the bottom line. Jim Snee : Yes. There definitely was a benefit from SKIPPY in the quarter. Really, as we talked about it with the escalation in costs, it's really across the board. We've talked about the operational inefficiencies. So, even though in aggregate, we're at a good place with our total number of employees, those employees are younger, less experienced and we are seeing that turnover. And then, we talked about some of the input costs, so continued escalation for -- across the supply chain -- and then specifically towards the end of the quarter as we saw some of the raw materials run up. And so, that really is what created that erosion of the benefit from SKIPPY. But we definitely did see a benefit in the quarter. Ken Zaslow : Okay. And then my second question is when you think about your long-term guidance, look, the last couple of years, you really haven't been within that. Is it -- what is it that changes? And is 2023, 2024 back into that long-term guidance range? Or is it going to still take time to reestablish your growth algorithm on a more consistent basis? How do you think about that? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean we're very positive about the business. We know that the brands are strong, the business is strong. We continue to fight the escalation in costs. We know that we have work to do on the operational front. We talked about our need to really capture the synergies and the value and our expanded logistics model. We've taken appropriate pricing. We are starting to see some relief on input costs here in the fourth quarter. That should translate into 2023. We've got back to pricing, the full year impact of some of the pricing that we've put in place. And I think -- for us, it is a better internal supply chain performance that will be a key driver for us. We do expect brands to continue to perform well. And so we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term growth algorithm. We do have some work to do, but we're confident that we can get it done. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And just to add to that, we also are currently underway executing the automation and really getting optimizing in different fronts from an operation standpoint. So that should certainly add to us being successful at executing on our long-term goals as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Tom Palmer : I wanted to ask on the Grocery Product side. Is the pricing that you've taken enough to offset the inflation that you're facing? Do you need additional rounds of pricing to address this still mounting inflation or maybe given your view that costs eased are added rounds of pricing maybe not planned at this point? Just trying to understand that dynamic and what kind of causes the inflection in grocery. Jim Snee : Yes. Thanks, Tom. Obviously, we're pleased with the strong organic top line growth, the strong demand for the Grocery Products portfolio. And you described the cost and pricing scenario very well. With the relief that we've recently seen from some of the key inputs, we don't believe that additional pricing is going to be necessary, that the pricing that is now going into effect in Q4 will be sufficient. But we did have pressure at the end of Q3 and in the early part of Q4 because of those elevated markets. Tom Palmer : Understood. And then maybe ask another question on the 4Q outlook. So, it sounds like the third quarter overall was pretty consistent with what you had talked about a quarter ago. So it would seem that essentially, the guidance cut was mainly for reduced expectations around the fourth quarter. From the comments today, it sounds like the kind of greatest incremental pressure was on refrigerated food -- is that accurate? And then to what extent do these easing costs that you mentioned in the last week, are they factored into the guidance range? Jim Snee : Yes. So it's a couple of things. The Refrigerated Foods group is impacted by the elevated markets as well. And as we think about the fourth quarter, there's always going to be the puts and takes. We've obviously seen a reoccurrence of HPAI with Josh. And so really, watching to see how that plays out throughout the quarter from an upside potential? Or is there some risk, really understanding what will happen with the consumer with this last round -- most recent round of GP pricing. And then the other part that is on our radar is although we've seen this market relief, we have also seen just an incredible amount of market volatility throughout the year. And so we've seen significant moves up and down. And so while we're in a better position today, we'll be watching that closely because we know how quickly that can change. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Moskow : A couple of questions. In the Grocery division, I'm now forecasting based on your guidance. I think a decline in profits for the year of about $20 million, $30 million. And that's despite having seven months incremental of the Planters acquisition. So, I guess I'd like to know, is Planters weaker than you thought? I didn't hear you reiterate Planters is double accretion number today. Maybe that's just -- it's still there. But -- and if it's not that, what is -- is it, which of the other brands? And then I have a follow-up, please. Jim Snee : Yes. Rob. So a couple of things. Your assessment of the GP division is correct. That will be down for the full year. When we think about Planters, although we probably weren't as intentional, the sales we're on track for the sales guidance that we've provided in line with our $1 billion guide, our earnings continue to be at the high end of that accretion model. And really for us, the long-term strategy is intact, right? So as we think about this being an important part of our entertaining and stacking platform, the work that we're doing in C-stores, the business is still performing the way we want it. There's always opportunities within categories. But overall, the business is well in line with our expectations. And really, what it is, it's the inflation that we've experienced in Grocery Products. And so, we've had significant packaging inflation. We've taken incremental pricing along the way. This most recent round of pricing should be very positive and favorable as we head into 2023. Robert Moskow : Okay. Maybe a follow-up then. When you talked about transitioning to one supply chain model, it sounded like a great idea and it consolidated a lot of the information, consolidated a lot of the, I guess, the decision-making. And yet, here we are in a year where your warehousing costs are higher than you thought your freight is and you're having still lingering labor issues. And I guess I have to ask, did this transition, did it exacerbate any issues? Did it make any of these issues incrementally easier? Why don't the transition help prevent a lot of these situations? Jim Snee : Yes. Great question, Rob. I mean -- and as I sit here, I can't imagine us having gone through what we've gone through over the last several years without having our One Supply Chain in place. Everything you described to have one purview of the supply chain has really helped us throughout COVID and some of these labor challenges. We're not alone in what's happening. You can go across industry and the conversation about turnover and these manufacturing variances, I mean, they're everywhere. We have work to do. And so we do -- we're getting people through the door. We're getting people hired -- there's work to do in terms of training and retaining those people so that we do, over time, develop that experience. That is a problem today. That's not a one supply chain issue. That's a broad-based issue. And I think when we think about other challenges, we continue to see countless upstream challenges from our suppliers. So industry-wide issues persist, and as I -- I'll finish where I started and that I just can't imagine us having gone through what we went through the last several years without having our one supply chain in place. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Lavery : I just wanted to come back to looking ahead a bit into fiscal '23. And maybe specifically, can you give a sense of how much of your commodity exposure is already locked in or hedged and how that might compare to what's typical? Jacinth Smiley : So we are currently, for the moment for 2022, have hedged our grains at around 80% for the year, and we have already started hedging and have actually locked in our hedge for 2023, albeit at an elevated level, given where grain sits today. So that's, of course, another challenge, and we're not 100% hedged. So, we still have a little bit of exposure to the market and working through as we think about other areas as well, leaning into four contracts where we can, where we are not able to really execute any hedges in those areas. Michael Lavery : So for this time of the year relative to the following fiscal year, are you less or more hedged than normal? Jacinth Smiley : We're consistent with where we're normally sitting at this stage. Michael Lavery : Okay. And just back to Jennie-O, you touched on the volume impact that will run at least through 1Q '23. Can you give a sense of the magnitude there? Obviously, third and fourth quarter this year, at least what you reported and expect is pretty different in terms of the magnitude of the impact on volume. What would it look like going forward? Jacinth Smiley : So going forward, I think tough it depends on what happens with HPAI, certainly. I mean, for this year, for the third quarter, our impact was about 20% less volume going into the fourth will be off 30% volume for the fourth quarter. And our expectation is as we go into the first quarter of next year, if for the fourth quarter. And our expectation is as we go into the first quarter of next year, if nothing else happened from an HPAI standpoint, we should be rebuilding our supply there and be in a good spot. Michael Lavery : So I think you had mentioned though, just a recent case or something that would add some pressure on 1Q. Would the volume pressure there be more like more similar to 4Q? Or do you expect it to be improving? Jacinth Smiley : No. Yes. We don't expect that volume pressure. So, we actually -- and you're exactly right. I mean we've had a couple of situations here within the last few days with -- but these were really young birds. And so, it is an impact that doesn't impact Q4 at all and actually pushes into the first quarter of next year, but really will be immaterial to the quarter. Jim Snee : Yes. So Michael, if we stay where we are today, we don't expect a material impact in Q1. As this always is, it's a developing situation. And so, we'll be watching it closely. But at this point, it's really too early to tell what the impact for Q1 would be. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Salera : Jim Salera on for Ben. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on some of the labor challenges. Is it that you're seeing more acute labor markets in the areas that you operate your facilities? And maybe as the economy weakens, that loosens up a little bit and gives you an opportunity to hire more people? Or is it just pure wage issue or flexibility? Or what are some of the specific challenges that are preventing getting those under control? Jim Snee : Yes. So the issue of hiring, getting people through the door is not a problem, right? So we're getting people hired. What we are seeing is that they're not staying, that there is higher than normal turnover, there's significant absenteeism. And we do think that partly driven by the labor market that we've had, the ability to find many jobs elsewhere. So to your point, is that as the labor market potentially tightens, does that lead to lower turnover, the ability to keep people longer and then build that experience and that training? Absolutely. So, it's not getting people hired, it's not a labor rate, it is just keeping the turnover down so that we can build the experience within our facility. Jim Salera : Okay. And as you expand automation through your plants, what's the time frame of how long it will take to get those equipment -- get that equipment in the plant and up and running to supplement maybe some of the necessity for those higher turn labor positions? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. So I mean that's going to vary, right? So we'll continue to always evolve and look for opportunities to take costs out of the plant. So there isn't really any point in time I'd say that we would stop doing that. So it really is a continuing improvement in our mind. Jim Salera : Okay. And then if I could sneak in one quick question on HPAI. Yes, I know there's been a couple of cases pop up here more recently despite the weather getting warmer. Do you guys have anything in maybe your contingency plan? Or if anything you could do to prepare for the possibility of this popping back up as the year progresses? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean we've obviously done a lot of work since -- you go back to 2015, the biosecurity efforts, the investments that we've made on our farms have been substantial. So, we've worked really hard. But clearly, this is still an issue. To your point, the new development is historically warm weather or heat has really tapped this down, but you're starting to see cases in California where temperatures are higher. And then just making sure, again, that we've got the continued emphasis and the continued focus on training with our team members that we keep this top of mind so, that we are able to minimize the effect. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Peter Galbo : I'll keep it pretty quick. Jim, just in the context of going back to the new operating model, I guess, I think you're going to stand up a brand -- a new brand center. Just curious, like are there incremental costs or restructuring actions that will come in with the re-segmentation and I guess, streamlining everything? I know you've talked about some of the synergies you expect to get, but just any of the upfront costs that we should kind of think about? Jim Snee : Yes, nothing really significant or material, Peter. We're moving some people around in chairs focusing their expertise in areas that we need some extra emphasis. So as we think about brand fuel, which is that center of excellence to really support all of our strategic pillars and brand in a bigger way. That will consist of our digital experience group, which has been a huge benefit to our organization. We'll continue to strengthen that area, making sure that our insights group is being fully utilized across the entire organization. So making a few investments there continued our good work on innovation and having that even more ingrained with the brand and the strategic pillars. So nothing really material as much as it is moving some people in chairs and then making sure, of course, that we've got all the right financial planning and analysis to support the business in a bigger way, but really nothing from a cost perspective that we're thinking about. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. The other piece I'll add there, I mean, really fundamentally, what it has done for us or what it will do is just to bring the synergistic brain power into one place to be able to support the business and just take away some of the silos in which we're working today and also bringing jobs as well into play as we integrate them into the organization as part of the transformation. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, Jim, I just want to go back to your comments around what I'm assuming mostly pertain to the hog markets. Obviously, you've seen a little bit of relief here. Your commentary suggested over time, you're expecting some relief. But just as we think out 12 to 18 months, just what are you tracking? What are you seeing that's suggesting you maybe that you'll get some relief on the protein side? Just given some of the USDA forecasts or maybe for less protein availability next year as opposed to more, and I would think that would keep prices higher, but just curious if there's anything that you're seeing that we should be aware of? Jim Snee : Yes, I think the biggest thing there, Peter, is the volatility that we continue to see. So in terms of the absolute supply, I mean our view is consistent with what everybody else is seeing. We're obviously going to be making some forecasts that are probably tied more to slightly higher than historical averages. But really, the difference in all of this is that, that volatility or when some of these markets are staying elevated longer than they historically have, like we've just seen here at the end of Q3 and for us, the first period of Q4. That's where we really start to experience some of that compression. So when you've got the elevation that's higher longer and then some of the volatility that has been persistent throughout the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Adam Samuelson : A lot of grounds been covered, but hoping maybe kind of get your view on trade and promotional spending here. I mean, you talked about the specific advertising dollars in SG&A that are up, but the trade spend that would be kind of above the revenue line. Any color on what that looks like today relative to maybe pre-COVID? And do you think that's going to have to get a bigger lever to pull over the next 12 to 18 months to combat maybe more risk in consumer price elasticity and retailers that might be a bit more wary of pricing actions? Jim Snee : Yes. I think, Adam, as supply continues to improve and we talked about still having a number of categories where demand is outstripping supply, but as supply continues to improve, we do expect that to be a lever that we've -- historically, we've always used it. We'll continue to use that in conjunction with the advertising dollars that we need to build the brand equity and build that connection with consumer. So yes, we do expect to see that to continue to be an integral part of our business going forward. And as we think about our updated operating model and we start to bring these retail businesses together, that's also going to be a benefit for us as we'll have, again, a bigger purview of all the retail businesses in terms of how we're interacting with customers and consumers. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then just quickly, in foodservice, any color you could provide maybe by some of the different channels or verticals within foodservice between quick service or institutional? You guys have a pretty broad kind of customer set there. And just any color on differences in trends between them would be helpful. Jim Snee : Yes. Not at this point, Adam. I mean we're seeing continued strength across all of the different channels where we compete. And I would say that a big driver of that, we've talked about some of our labor issues. So many foodservice operators are facing those same labor issues. So they're forced to think differently about how they're going to be able to provide products. And we talked a lot about the value-added offerings that we have in our foodservice portfolio really being able to help those operators move the labor that they do have from back of the house to front of the house, and we are -- we continue to see that play out. We have seen a strong back-to-school season, not only with our Jennie-O K-12 business, but with the work that the Hormel side does on the colleges and universities. So again, really, really strong broad-based foodservice business. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Jim Snee for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Yes. Thank you. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As we've talked about this morning, our business remains incredibly healthy even as we continue to navigate some of the most difficult operating conditions in our company's 130-year history. Our team is focused on a strong finish to 2022, but we're also incredibly excited about our future with the implementation of our Go Forward initiative to update and better align our operating model against our strategic initiatives. This is a positive and exciting time for Hormel Foods. Have a safe and enjoyable Labor Day weekend. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2022 was a return to growth for our business as we delivered record sales and double-digit earnings growth compared to last year. Fiscal 2022 marked the third consecutive year of record sales and the second most profitable year in our company's 131-year history. In addition to achieving strong year-over-year growth, our team made considerable progress on our six strategic priorities. First, we continued our efforts to protect and grow our core brands. Sales in our retail channel increased 7% in fiscal 2022, led by brands such as SPAM, SKIPPY, Hormel Natural Choice, Dinty Moore, Hormel Square Table entree, and Mary Kitchen. Of note, the SPAM family of products achieved its eighth consecutive year of record growth. Second, we made progress amplifying our presence in snacking and entertaining. We delivered excellent growth on the Columbus and Hormel Gatherings brand, and we have successfully integrated the Planters business. We have a powerhouse of brands with the goal of becoming the leading solutions provider in the snacking and entertainment space. Third, we saw growth from our ethnic and food forward portfolios. Both our MegaMex joint venture and Applegate business achieved sales milestones this fiscal year, driving growth behind the WHOLLY, Herdez and Applegate brands, respectively. These businesses are well positioned in the marketplace due to their strong and reputable brands, on-trend innovation and loyal consumer bases. Fourth, we continue to expand our leadership position in food service. Sales in the foodservice channel grew 20% compared to last year, as operators again turn to our items to help solve for labor pressures and to diversify menu offerings. We drove excellent growth in this critically important channel, highlighted by brands such as Bacon 1, Austin Blues, Hormel Fire Braised and Caf\u00e9 H. Our foodservice portfolio and direct selling organization remain key differentiators and growth catalysts for the company. Fifth, we invested into our international business, as we look to aggressively develop our global presence. In fiscal 2022, we commissioned a state-of-the-art innovation center, supporting the Asia Pacific region and approved another capacity investment to support our growth in China. Our international business is expected to be a significant growth driver for the company. And finally, we continue to transform our company. We made noteworthy progress on our transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store and lay the groundwork for the next step in our evolution as a global branded food company, our go-forward initiative. We also made considerable progress on our 20 By 30 Challenge. Some of the year's highlights included : matching 100% of our domestic energy use in fiscal 2022 with renewable sourcing; remaining on track to have an approved science-based target for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2023, becoming a major sponsor of up to 50,000 acre regenerative agriculture pilot project in Central and Southeast Minessota; announcing our commitment to create a food secure community program in Austin, Minnesota, with the additional goal of sharing the blueprint and findings globally. We are making a difference, thanks to the incredible work and dedication of our team members, partners and suppliers. Our team showed tremendous resolve to deliver growth in fiscal 2022. The team overcame broad-based inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, the impacts from highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, and numerous headwinds in our international business. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the team for their dedication, hard work and for demonstrating our results matter mentality again this past year. In the fourth quarter, our team delivered diluted earnings per share comparable with record results last year and last year included an additional week of sales. These results further demonstrate that our brands remain healthy and the strategic investments we have made are enabling growth. We achieved another quarter of organic sales growth, led by our center store grocery portfolio and solid performances from our foodservice businesses. Segment profit growth was due to the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment as the team again managed Turkey supply effectively and maximized operational performance. We also made progress across our supply chain to increase production capabilities and restore inventories on key product lines. Fill rates for retail, deli and foodservice items all improved compared to last year and the third quarter. As we announced in August, we recently began transitioning our business to a new strategic operating model. As of October 31, we have moved to three operating segments : retail, foodservice and international. Over the last month, we have been working to create a unified retail organization with scale, experience, expertise and passion to grow our almost $8 billion portfolio of brands. We are approaching customers differently, bringing together subject matter experts from across our businesses to find growth opportunities and execute strategies in the marketplace. We are leading with a more food-forward mentality, thinking and acting differently in the ways we position our brands with consumers. This has created new opportunities that were not easily executed in our old model. And we are working with a newly created brand fuel team to ignite the potential of our products in store and on shelf. And these early successes are not limited to our retail team. Our combined foodservice team will further leverage the scale of planters in the convenience store channel, while assuming full control of the company's foodservice Turkey business, including the Jennie-O brand. Though we are only in the initial stages of the implementation, we are receiving positive responses from our customers and operators. Our immediate focus is to accelerate the execution of our six strategic priorities while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and operators. Specific to the first quarter, our teams will be working to adopt the new organizational design, management structures and accountabilities. The teams will be working to continue the work to integrate Jennie-O Turkey Store into the company's one supply chain and new operating segments. And our teams will be working to stand up the brand fuel Center of Excellence, which will house enterprise-wide brand management expertise, e-commerce capabilities, insights-led innovation and analytical support to better enable data-driven decisions. Earnings will be reported under this structure beginning with the release of fiscal 2023 first quarter results in early March. We will be supplying recast financial information for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 in February 2023. The deliberate and thoughtful steps we have taken thus far are all about better aligning our structure with our proven strategy to create the Hormel Foods of the future. We are excited for the additional collaboration, capabilities and value we will realize from this transition and remain confident in our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth. Turning to our outlook. We expect to grow both sales and earnings in fiscal 2023. We enter fiscal 2023 well positioned for the current macroeconomic climate and expect top line growth from all three of our new segments : retail, foodservice and international. In retail, we expect demand for our center store grocery business to remain strong as consumers continue to seek products and brands that offer high value, versatility and convenience. We expect growth from Planters and the rest of our snacking and entertaining businesses, including the Columbus and Gatherings brands. Planters will be rolling out meaningful innovation throughout the year to complement and expand on the new flavor varieties and packaging introduced in fiscal 2022. We expect to benefit from the investments we have made in additional Black Label bacon and Hormel Pepperoni capacity and are excited for the new SPAM capacity to be operational in the first half of the year. And lastly, we expect a recovery in turkey volumes in the back half of the year, allowing our teams to continue to create a demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio. This is heavily dependent on any future impacts to the supply chain from HPAI. We expect that the pricing actions taken over the past few quarters should result in a benefit to net sales in fiscal 2023. However, we have also accounted for additional impacts from elasticities as these new pricing actions are adopted in the marketplace. To help mitigate risk to our retail volumes, we plan to increase advertising and brand investment, make further progress on our efforts to continue to improve fill rates and return to full assortments across our leading platforms. We plan to deliver innovation across the portfolio. We'll leverage the capabilities of go forward, which include our well-established revenue growth management and digital experience teams, our combined direct selling organization and our newly created Brand Fuel team. In Foodservice, we are expecting another year of growth from our solutions-based portfolio and direct selling team. We entered the year from a position of strength after two consecutive years of robust growth during the industry recovery. The consistent inroads our teams have made over time, including during previous economic slowdowns to diversify our presence in emerging and non-commercial channels will help us navigate through future market volatility and uncertainty. Additionally, the team plans to leverage the Planters and Jennie-O brands to make further gains in the convenience and K-12 channels, respectively. Our international business had a challenging year in 2022, but we expect a strong return to growth in fiscal 2023. Demand for our products globally is robust, and our production capabilities and inventory levels are healthy to support this demand. We believe that many of the export challenges we experienced this past year will gradually subside. Like many, we are currently monitoring the situation in China. We are actively engaged with our in-country management team and are prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our team members. This team has been resilient in the face of numerous challenges and will continue to deliver growth with balance between retail and foodservice. From an overall bottom line perspective, we anticipate earnings growth to be driven by our foodservice and international segments and improvements across the supply chain. We expect to operate in a volatile, complex and high-cost environment again in fiscal 2023, which is why we are increasingly focused on reducing costs and inefficiencies as part of our One Supply Chain initiative. We have a strong track record of consistently capturing approximately $75 million per year of supply chain savings through our continuous improvement programs. Though these efforts continued over the last three years, the benefits have been masked by pandemic-related impacts, labor shortages, industry-wide supply chain disruption and most recently, broad-based inflation. We will continue to identify and capture cost savings opportunities, find the efficiencies and drive unnecessary costs out of our system. We fully expect that over time, these actions, in addition to the benefits of broader market stabilization will result in more normalized operating margins for our business. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect full year net sales of $12.6 billion to $12.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.83 to $1.93 per share. We have continued to benefit from our balanced business model, which is not heavily dependent on any one channel, protein, input or product category. We also have a dedicated well-respected, experienced and stable management team that has again proven their ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile market conditions. Our long-term strategy to meet consumers where they want to eat with a broad portfolio of trusted brands and products will continue to be a key differentiator for our business, helping to drive growth for our customers and operators. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss more detailed financial information and provide more color on key drivers to the fiscal 2023 outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. I want to start my remarks by congratulating Jim Snee. Jim was recently recognized as the 2022 Responsible CEO of the Year for transformative leadership by 3BL Media. During the award ceremony, Dave Armon, CEO of 3BL Media said and I quote, \u201cThe world needs business leaders who are operating with their eyes wide open and using the power of their businesses to bring forward meaningful ESG programs and policies to operate in a transparent manner\u201d. Jim truly embodies these characteristics. We at Hormel Foods are honored to witness firsthand Jim's leadership style and be part of the difference our company is making to inspire a change, lift communities and bring people together. Congratulations, Jim, on this well-deserved recognition. The company achieved a record full year net sales of $12.5 billion, up 9% from a year ago. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $3.3 billion, a 5% decline from the prior year, which included an additional week. Organic net sales increased 2% for the fourth quarter. Operating income for the fourth quarter and the full year increased 3% and 17%, respectively, overcoming the additional week of sales last year. Strong results from Jennie-O Turkey Store segment, higher foodservice sales, pricing actions to mitigate inflationary pressures and the inclusion of the Planters business were the primary drivers to earnings growth during the year. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.51 was comparable to the record quarterly earnings set last year. Diluted earnings per share for the full year were $1.82, a 10% increase. The company's actions to offset inflationary pressures were evident in the fourth quarter. Operating margin of 11.2% was significantly ahead of 9.6% in the third quarter. Operating margin for the year was 10.5%, an improvement versus operating margin of 9.9% last year. For the full year, SG&A as a percentage of sales fell to 7.1% from 7.5% last year. Advertising spend increased 14% compared to last year with higher investments seen across every segment. In fiscal 2023, we are again planning higher investments to support key brands, including Planters, SPAM, SKIPPY, Columbus, BLACK LABEL, Hormel Pepperoni and Jennie-O. Net unallocated expenses in 2022 decreased due to Planters acquisition costs last year. In fiscal 2022, higher interest expense and investment losses on the Rabi Trust net of associated deferred compensation, negatively impacted earnings by approximately $0.05. The effective tax rate for the year was 21.7%, compared to 19.3% last year. The effective tax range for fiscal 2023 is expected to be 21% to 23%. The company again generated strong and consistent cash flow with operating cash flow increasing 13%, compared to last year. We generated more than $1 billion in cash from operations, allowing us to invest in future growth, return a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, supporting ongoing business needs and increase our cash balance to nearly $1 billion. We invested $279 million in capital projects in 2022. The company's target for capital expenditures in 2023 is $350 million, which includes investment in value-added capacity, technology, and automation to increase production and drive long-term savings and efficiencies. As Jim mentioned earlier, we recently approved another significant expansion to our operations in China, which we expect to come in operation in fiscal 2024. We returned a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2022. We paid over $550 million in dividends during the year, including our 377th consecutive quarterly dividend, effective November 15. We announced a 6% increase in the dividend for fiscal 2023, marking the 57th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our strong financial position also allows us to continue sharing our successes with our team members. For fiscal 2022, we will share approximately $20 million with the team, including our annual profit sharing for the 84th consecutive year. Remaining investment grade is a top priority for the company. The company ended the year with $3.3 billion of debt. On a net basis, we're below our stated goal of 1.5 to two times EBITDA. Our first debt repayment related to the Planters acquisition is due June 2024 with a fixed rate of 65 basis points. Our total outstanding debt is fixed, with an average yield of 1.7%. As Jim previously mentioned, we expect sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2023. I want to revisit some of the comments we made in our third quarter earnings call, in the context of our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2023. Heading into the fourth quarter, we cited the impact of an escalation in certain operational, logistical and inflationary costs. Generally, these assumptions played out as expected, and we anticipate similar trends in fiscal 2023. We made additional progress across the supply chain during the fourth quarter and are becoming more efficient and productive. Fill rates improved compared to last year and the third quarter. We continue to see increased applicant and hiring flow at our production facilities. Our focus is on onboarding and training new team members and creating a best-in-class experience throughout our operations. Freight and warehousing expenses remain elevated during the quarter. We saw signs of moderation in the domestic freight environment as truck availability improved, though higher diesel prices offset a portion of this benefit. Higher warehousing expenses were driven by a recovery in our inventory levels and industry-wide labor challenges. In 2023, we expect some of this pressure to be offset by savings from the work the team has been doing to control freight expenses and expand our logistics network. Prices on key protein inputs generally declined during the quarter, except for port trim, higher priced inventory was a headwind in the quarter as we worked through inventory produced during the summer commodity peaks. Protein prices are expected to remain volatile in fiscal 2023. Additionally, we expect packaging, energy and labor costs to remain elevated or increase in 2023 and for upstream challenges to persist. Actions by our One Supply Chain team will be key to managing and mitigating additional cost escalation in these areas. Beginning in fiscal 2023, our Turkey business will primarily reside in the retail and foodservice segment. HPAI has reemerged this fall and this unprecedented event has affected our vertically integrated supply chain at about one-third of the magnitude of the spring event. We now anticipate the impacts for HPAI to reduce production volume in our Turkey facilities through at least the first half of fiscal 2023. Breast meat prices remain historically high and have yet to moderate. Our team has done an exceptional job managing through disruptions caused by HPAI. Reflected in our guidance range or assumptions for higher pension expense and higher feed costs for our Turkey business. Taken together, these costs are approximately $0.15 of headwind specific to fiscal 2023. In addition to these costs, we have planned incremental investment against One Supply Chain and go forward supporting areas such as infrastructure, automation, data analytics, brand support and investment in innovation capabilities. In closing, I am extremely excited about Go Forward and our plans to unlock even more potential from our now $12 billion uncommon company. We have a long track record of successfully evolving our company, which is a credit to our strong management team and our inspired team members around the world, better aligning our structure with our strategy, which is at the core of this transition positions us well into 2023 and for the long-term. Said simply, Go Forward ensures that we will continue to deliver on our commitment to our team members, customers and shareholders. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question and answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Jim, I'm just curious, like, in the overall protein complex and understanding that protein is now a much smaller portion of your overall business than maybe it was historically. But your single biggest input is still pork and that seems to have been less deflationary at this point than the other proteins, beef is down pretty substantially; chicken, obviously, has come off materially. Just curious about your outlook over the next 12 months, what is it going to take to get some of these port prices and particularly the cuts that you buy to kind of match the other proteins that we're seeing in terms of how deflationary they've been? And maybe how that might end up pulling through your business, both from a top line and margin standpoint? A \u2013 Jim Snee : Yeah. Thanks, Peter. Good morning. Pork is still a very important part of our complex, as you described. And for us, we think that pork still represents a great value to consumers. As we're looking into 2023 end markets, although we expect some moderate relief are still going to run well above five-year averages. And we've also seen a lot of volatility throughout the last several years, and that's what we really have talked about is it's not so much the point to point, but some of the volatility that occurs. The other thing that we're watching very, very closely is the export element in terms of what's happening with pork. So one of the things to consider is as turkey prices are higher, we're seeing bone-in hams be exported at an accelerated rate. And then the other thing is just thinking about the continued labor challenges that are out there. And so one of our key inputs across a lot of our business is pork trim. And if the labor is not there to do the necessary boning to get the trim, then we're not going to see that relief. So there are a lot of variables at play, but we know that there are things that we can control. We know that our brands are going to remain strong. The work that we're doing to drive that demand is very successful. And now we just need some of these other variables that are outside of our control to play out more favorably for us. Q \u2013 Peter Galbo : Got it. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And Jacinth, maybe if I could ask a two-parter or just on some of the moving pieces in the guidance for 2023. Of the $0.15 you mentioned that I think is a headwind from pension and turkey. Can you just break down for us what exactly the pension piece is versus the feed costs? And then also just within the guidance, I don't think I heard any mention on MegaMex, I think avocado prices have gotten more favorable. So any commentary there as well? Thanks very much. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. Good morning. So yes, so the pension and feed costs definitely headwinds as we go into 2023. The split between the two is about $0.10 related to feed and $0.05 related to pension costs. And as it relates to our MegaMex business, we expect avocado prices to continue to go down. So that will translate into positive impact for us on our MegaMex business. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Yes. Hi, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Jim, could you elaborate maybe a little more on the dynamics and what you're seeing amongst consumers around the elasticity. So you've talked a little bit about it in the prepared remarks, but it would be nice to understand what's like kind of embedded within your guidance on top line, how much of a decline in volume, you kind of anticipate based on the pricing you've done more recently, which obviously still remains a tailwind, particularly in the first fiscal half, because of the prices that you've just implemented more recently. So that would be my first question. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning. Ben. So, I mean, it varies category-by-category. As you know, we've got some categories where the elasticities are performing at more historical levels. I think probably our legacy grocery products, which show a big part of that being our new convenience meals pillar. But then we've got some others where we're seeing elasticity, but not quite to the rate that we would have historically. The thing that is positive for us is, we're not seeing anything above historical levels for elasticity. And so that, let's say, a really, really good thing. The other part that we need to make sure we're thinking about is our foodservice business. A significant part of our overall portfolio. That business -- the demand continues to remain strong. Portfolio is well positioned, and that team is just doing a great job not only driving new demand, but also taking share. Ben Theurer : Perfect. And then just on the CapEx number, can you elaborate a little bit on like what part of that is how much of that is maintenance? How much is maybe what you didn't execute or initially may plan to execute in 2022 and then couldn't how much a rollover, how much is maintenance and how much is really dedicated new CapEx for 2023? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. So we have -- in the plan for 2023, the $350 million of CapEx plan of that, the maintenance portion is fairly consistent with what we have on a yearly basis at about $125 million of that number. I mean in terms of rollover, we certainly have pieces coming over from last year, which is relating to our SPAM and on our China expansion that we're doing. Jim Snee : Yeah. And just on that note, Ben, as we've said in our comments, SPAM capacity will come online the early part of 2023. And then really the China capacity that Jacinth references will really come online until 2024. Ben Theurer : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Ken Zaslow : Hey, good morning, guys. Jim Snee : Hi, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Two questions. One is, when you think about your pricing actions, which categories have you taken pricing to cover the cost? Which ones do you still need to take pricing to cover the costs? And then I have a follow-up. Jim Snee : Yeah. I think as you think about our portfolio, again, going back to our legacy Grocery Products portfolio. We've taken significant pricing but haven't quite covered down all of the inflation that we're seeing. But as part of that, and you know this, Ken, is we're being very sensitive to some of the price gaps that are out there in the category. So we've had to watch that closely. We're seeing some of those gaps start to narrow as others are moving. So that's a good thing. And then we are continuing to look at certain categories. But as always, we're going to have to be very, very strategic. But I would say, as we think about our overall portfolio, that's probably the biggest gap that we have. Ken Zaslow : Okay. You gave guidance kind of on the top line. You didn't give a feel for the operating profit, which ones of the divisions you'll see \u2013 even if you do high, low, medium, more than average, less than average. Any sort of commentary on the profit growth outlook by division would be quite helpful, just particularly given that you're changing divisions, and we don't have the same sort of history of understanding how those margins will kind of evolve. So any sort of commentary on that would be really appreciated? Jim Snee : Yeah. I think in our prepared remarks, Ken, we talked about growth really being driven by foodservice and international. As I said, we expect our foodservice business to remain strong. Our current demand is very positive. Portfolio is well positioned. Our international business, we expect to bounce back and some of those headwinds moderate. The retail business, which is experiencing the biggest change in this new operating model is certainly going to have the impact of some of the feed costs that Jacinth has talked about. So consistent with what we said in the prepared remarks, we really expect the drivers of the growth to be foodservice and international. Ken Zaslow : So when you were talking about it, and I don't want to ask a third question, I understand that. But when you were talking about it, you were talking about the sales or the operating profit. I thought during the commentary, you were mostly talking about sales, but you will \u2013 you think it applies to the operating profit as well. I just want to clarify, and then I'll leave it there. Jim Snee : Yeah. Think about both of them that way, Ken. Ken Zaslow : Okay. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yep. Ken Zaslow : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi. I actually have a bunch of questions here. You said that, feed costs are going to be the biggest headwind for retail in fiscal 2023. Is that because Turkey, like the majority of Turkey will be lumped into it. And just in the context of all these other retail businesses that are now catching up to margins, it just strikes me that the U.S. retail outlook is pretty soft. Like, most of your packaged food peers are catching up and exceeding last year's gross margins, because of all the pricing they've taken. So, what's different here? Is it just turkey, or are there other things? Hello? Operator : Hello. Pardon, everyone. This is the conference operator. It looks like we've lost the speaker connection. I want to put music back on, and we'll be right back with you. We ask you please hold the line. Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] And everyone, we thank you for your patience. We've reconnected the speaker location. Mr. Moskow, if you can please repeat your question sir. Thank you. Robert Moskow : Sure. So it was a question about the guidance for retail, I guess, for profits to be flattish or maybe even down in 2023. And you said it was because of feed cost, is that because the majority of Jennie-O will end up in retail. And ex that, would you have expected retail profits to grow? Because in comparison to all these other US packaged food companies, it seems like the next 12 months is characterized by pricing catching up to cost and gross margins re-expanding? Jim Snee : Yeah. I think the way you're just -- Rob, first of all, our apologies. Secondly, the way you're describing it is correct and that the feed costs as you think about the value-added business, the whole bird business, a lot of the commodity business that will be flowing now into retail will be impacted by those higher feed cost as just described. So I mean absent that the rest of the business as we think about the pillars are very positive. Robert Moskow : Okay. And could you help us a little bit just on your outlook for Turkey in fiscal 2023, because it must be a pretty wide range of outcomes given the uncertainties around AI. And is your outlook different for commodity than it is for value-add? Is it still very positive for commodity and weak for value-add? How should we think about it? Jim Snee : Yeah. You're opening statement is correct. Again, Rob, is that there's a lot of uncertainty as we think about the jobs business going forward. On our last quarterly call, we had talked about us being back to more normalized levels after the first quarter. Now, we're talking about the back half of the year. And then everything that you just described really all depends on the meat availability in our system and then what's available elsewhere. So there is just a lot of uncertainty in the jobs business throughout 2023. Robert Moskow : Can I assume that you're assuming flat profits in Turkey just as a starting point for 2023, or how should I think about it? Jim Snee : Yeah. I mean, I think that's a good starting point. We've got feed costs. You've got breast meat markets, you've got supply. There's just so many variables there as we progress throughout the year. We'll certainly be keeping you well-advised. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question today comes from Tom Palmer at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tom Palmer : Thanks for the question. I wanted to get some clarity maybe on the expected earnings cadence for the year. You made mention, for instance, of certain pork cuts rolling over. It sounds like maybe we see more of a flow-through of that in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. At the same time, there's some operational changes underway. Maybe those present some initial cost headwinds. So how does this shake out just as we think about earnings progression for the year? Jim Snee : Good morning, Tom. As we're thinking about the earnings growth that we described, I mean we expect it to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, half one and half two. Clearly, we've identified the major impacts that are out there in terms of feed and the pension costs that we've already talked about several times. And as we go throughout the year, we we've talked about the need to really now find some supply chain savings. We've talked about the fact that we expect fill rates to improve -- continue to improve as we progress. We've got some pricing that will continue to roll forward. International, we expect to moderate and improve throughout the year. And so there are some things that will happen sequentially, but as we're looking at the business, we do expect it to be pretty evenly distributed between half one and half two. Tom Palmer : Understood. Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask on the cash balance approaching $1 billion. You highlighted that there's really not any near-term debt due, and it's pretty low cost. So how should we think about deploying this? I mean is this -- you'll retire some debt in the coming year? Or is it more -- this is put aside as a way to effectively fund M&A without having to go to capital markets and maybe a higher interest rate environment? And then just with regards to that M&A side, I think you talked about international being an opportunity at the Investor Day. Is that still the priority, or just given macro uncertainty, should maybe domestic be more of a priority? Jacinth Smiley : Good morning, Tom. So our capital allocation policy and approach will remain -- it still remains the same. And so, yes, I mean, we're happy that we continue to generate very strong cash flow, and we will continue to deploy it strategically as it relates to paying down the debt. We still believe that is not the best use of our cash today. Our first payment doesn't come due until 2024. And so again, we'll continue to be strategic. We're continuing to look at opportunities from an M&A perspective and aligning those with our six strategic priorities. And so that is really how we'll think about deploying our funds, paying our dividends, continuing to remain a dividend aristocrat. That's very important to us. And in terms of the cadence of how we deploy the funds, as I talked about, that still remains consistent with our strategic approach for deploying our cash. Jim Snee : And from an M&A perspective, Tom, we are still very interested in international opportunities. We believe that we can continue to leverage what we've built in Asia Pacific, China. We've talked a lot about snacking and entertaining as we built out the SKIPPY portfolio, the Planters portfolio, also the work that we've done in Brazil. So international certainly remains a key area for us as we're thinking about the acquisition front. Tom Palmer : Right. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to just go back to top-line growth of 1% to 3% growth. I was just curious if you can just again walk through the key puts and takes there. At least to me, it seems a little lighter than we thought going into this year. Jim Snee : Good morning, Rupesh. I think there are -- just like you described, lots of puts and takes. We do know that we're going to have some positive impact from pricing. We expect strong growth, foodservice and international. We are bringing more capacity online in 2023. But then we also know that we've got elasticities that will be somewhat of an offset. But as we've already talked about, really the biggest wildcard in terms of the top-line for next year is jobs. And so knowing that we're dealing with this unprecedented fall event and it's already pushed back what we expect to be a more normalized level by a quarter. We have to wait and see what happens in the spring time. And so, really, that's the biggest unknown as we think about our sales outlook in 2023. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. That's helpful color. And then, just on the US consumer. Obviously, you guys are seeing great strength in your Grocery Products business and you're seeing strength of foodservice. So just curious how you think about the consumer just based on your vantage points in both channels. Jim Snee : As we're thinking about 2023, it's continued strength. The brands are doing well. All of the scan data for the most recent 13 weeks are showing really positive dollar sales growth. As you said, the foodservice business just continues to do really, really well, not only finding new opportunities, but they're also doing a really nice job of taking share. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please, go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Jim Snee : Good morning. Michael Lavery : I just wanted to unpack pricing a little bit. And, I guess, just would love to understand in your guidance. Does it factor in -- can you quantify roughly what amount of pricing is included in the growth outlook? And how much is that, just -- are you counting on just the pricing you've already taken flowing through, rolling into next year, or do you anticipate new pricing actions on top of that? Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning, Michael. What we've not factored in there right now are the pricing actions that we've taken. And so, again, if you think about the grocery products pricing that went into place in the fourth quarter, our Jennie-O Turkey Store pricing that we put in place really also in the fourth quarter. On the refrigerated side of the business, we've taken pricing on pepperoni. And so, we've got some pretty significant wraparound pricing there. And as we're thinking about 2023, just what I said earlier is, we're really watching the price gaps in the categories. We have to be very responsible. We are seeing some gaps close. And we're also looking at those areas where we can be a bit more precise and strategic. So what we have in there today is already what we've taken, but we are assessing where there are those opportunities and where it's necessary going forward. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And just on the margin outlook and maybe not necessarily specific to next year or fiscal 2023. It seems like you're guiding for some modest margin expansion. But as you think about just where margin levels were two, three years ago, how much can you restore that, or how long does it take? What's sort of the outlook as far as the margin build going forward? Jim Snee : Yes. As we're thinking about it, the headwinds that we've covered down or had to cover down over the last several years are pretty significant. And the team has done a great job, when we think about some of the commodity costs that we've had, we've talked a lot about freight and warehousing costs. So as we think about relief from some markets, we've got in still incredibly high markets, some of the packaging costs. We've got to do a better job of taking costs out of our supply chain and our operations. And so it's all of those things that we need to focus on, but also get some moderation on, which to say is going to happen in any specific point in time. If we've learned anything over the last three years is that's really hard to do. But thinking about the things that we can control and focusing on those things is really what's going to allow us to continue on this journey of margin expansion. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question today comes from Eric Larson at Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. Eric Larson : Yes. Thanks. I hope everybody had -- thanks for taking my question. I hope everybody had a good Turkey Day. I was thinking that you could have given your employees a really nice nontaxable bonus just by giving turkey this year. Jim Snee : You should have called us sooner. Eric Larson : Exactly. So Jim, I, like others, we're just kind of struggling to kind of think through the process of your new structure, which we will eventually get used to. But for people like me, I've been looking at your business this way previously -- it's measured in decades, as you know. So, I guess my first question that I want to ask is -- I think you've now -- and it relates to your commodity sales business -- your commodity sales, your commodity pork sales, which I think you now have effectively by contract. I don't think you have much of that anymore. And I'd like an update on that as well. And then, the commodity sales also for Jennie-O, I know I don't have a huge Foodservice business, but why would Foodservice not participate in some of the ups and downs in the commodity pricing market, given that neither retail nor foodservice would be responsible for that commodity business solely? So, how do the commodity sales for all the stuff kind of land in your new retail, foodservice, international structure? Jim Snee : Yes. Great question, Eric. So, a couple of things. I mean as we head into this new operating model, I mean, clearly, we're going to continue to provide clarity and education. The key takeaway in all of this is really about how we are able to align our strategy with our structure. And although we've had all of our different reporting segments historically, we haven't had it as well aligned as it could be. So that's really where we're heading. David and the team will obviously be spending a lot of time on the education front to make sure everybody understands what is, where and why. From a Jennie-O perspective, as we think about how that commodity business in particular falls, it will fall between our retail and international business. And so there will be elements that will fall in both. When the other part of it, as you mentioned, is the foodservice piece, is there's still a significant Jennie-O business in our Foodservice segment. And then the other part you mentioned was just in regards to traditional pork commodity sales. And that business, I mean, our team has done just a great job over the last number of years, finding ways to really derisk the business, derisk the commodity side. And right now, we're less than 10%. And so that's a journey that we've been on for a very long time. We continue to stay focused on that. And the team has just done a great job. So hopefully, that gives you a little more clarity. But just so you know, as we get into 2023, we'll have those opportunities for education and further discussion. Eric Larson : Okay. Thanks guys. I appreciate the time. Jim Snee : Yep. Operator : And our next question today comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, everyone. This is Arthur on for Adam. If you could just talk to us about how Jennie-O performed relative to your expectations. It looks like volume declines weren't nearly as much as we had anticipated and you had noted in the last quarter's call. And if you could also give us some color on -- to whatever extent you can, margin headwinds from fixed cost under absorption and how pricing, specifically commodity pricing affected that or offset that? Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning, Arthur. I would say that our Jennie-O business was actually in line with our expectations. And what we have said for the back half of last year, when we first started to see the outbreak was that we were going to have a 30% decline in volume in the back half of the year, and that's almost exactly what we saw. So the volume piece was accurate. Clearly, the drivers or what happened with the breast meat market, obviously, whole birds, so there's always a lot of moving parts. But I would say that, by and large, it met our expectations. And then I'm sorry, I missed the second part of the question. Unidentified Analyst : Just to what extent fixed cost under absorption was a headwind on margins? And what offset you had on pricing? Jim Snee : Yes. Arthur, I think David is going to have some follow-up calls. So maybe we'd be better served to handle that there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management continue for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. As we close the book on our fiscal 2022, I want to once again thank our team for delivering such strong results for the fourth quarter and full year. I also want to thank the entire team for their hard work, as we embark on our new operating model. We still have work to do, but their efforts to date have been nothing short of outstanding as we create the Hormel Foods of the future. As we go forward into 2023, I want to wish all of you a happy, healthy and safe holiday season. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to David Dahlstrom, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. David Dahlstrom : Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods conference call for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We released our results this morning before the market opened around 6 :30 AM Eastern. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. On our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jacinth Smiley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Deanna Brady, Executive Vice President of the Retail segment. Jim will review the company's first quarter results and give a perspective on the rest of fiscal 2023. Jacinth will provide detailed financial results and further commentary on our outlook, and Deanna will join for the Q&A portion of the call. The line will be opened for questions following Jacinth\u2019s remarks.  As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow up. If you have additional questions, you are welcome to get back into the queue.  At the conclusion of this morning's call, a webcast replay will be posted to our investor website in archive for one year. Additionally, earlier this week, we filed a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that included supplemental segment financial information for fis years 2021 and 2022 related to the GoFWD initiative. We have posted a copy of the Form 8-K to our investor website, investor.hormelfoods.com. Before we get started, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward looking and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which can be accessed at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section.  I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. With the release of our recast financial information earlier this week, our transition from a structural and reporting perspective is now complete for the GoFWD initiative. I want to take time to acknowledge the immense amount of work the entire team has put in to transition the business to our new strategic operating model. We have spent time discussing the strategic rationale and how our actions over the past decade have positioned us for go forward. But there has been a lot of blocking and tackling that had to take place first to get us to where we are today. Over the past six months, we stood up three new business segments, and consolidated the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. This included organizing the Retail segment into six distinct verticals, and combining the foodservice businesses across the enterprise. We invested in new centers of excellence, including brand fuel, and a dedicated FP&A team. And we made changes to the administrative side of the business to recast the financial statements, align and structure our entities and duties, maintain controls across the business, and of course, operate our business without interruption. We have learned a lot about our people, processes and technology going through this transition. While we have work to do in all of these areas, I am encouraged by the conversations that are taking place across the organization. The operating environment remains challenging. And while many areas of the business performed ahead of last year during the first quarter, our results were disappointing and below our expectations. From a top-line perspective, demand from consumers and operators generally remained elevated in key categories. And we delivered balanced growth between volume and price across many parts of our portfolio. We continue to see elevated demand for many of our center store refrigerated Mexican and premium items at retail, including Black Label bacon, Columbus charcuterie, Hormel chili, Hormel pepperoni, Applegate breaded chicken, Herdez products, Square Table entrees and Mary Kitchen hash. Likewise, solutions based items in our Foodservice segment had another strong quarter, with volume growth in sliced meats and from brands such as Cafe H, Fire Braised, Bacon 1 and Austin Blues. For the quarter, sales declined 2%. As a reminder, there continues to be volatility in our overall volume and net sales results, given the planned volume declines in commodity pork, and the volume impacts across the turkey supply chain due to highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI.  Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40, a $0.04 decline compared to last year. Our results reflect the persistent impact from inflationary pressures, supply chain inefficiencies and lower sales volumes across each of the business segments. Now, turning to our segments. Results in the Retail segment declined compared to last year. Net sales growth from the bacon, global flavors, convenient meals and proteins, and emerging brands verticals was offset by lower sales in the value-added meats, and snacking and entertaining verticals. Segment profit declined as the benefit from pricing actions across the portfolio, higher equity in earnings from MegaMex and improved results for the bacon business were more than offset by the impact from lower net sales, unfavorable mix and higher operating costs. The bacon verticals delivered outstanding results in the quarter due to elevated demand for our Black Label items. There was also a benefit from commodity relief in pork bellies throughout the quarter as we work through higher cost inventory. This is a category where we have made significant investments, and one we expect to show growth for the year. Similarly, the global flavors vertical made up of our MegaMex business had an excellent start to the year. The pricing actions that we've taken across this business to combat inflationary pressures, coupled with commodity relief on avocado inputs, led to revenue and equity and earnings gains for the quarter. The emerging brands vertical delivered volume and sales growth for the Applegate brand led by frozen breaded chicken and whole deli items. The convenient meals and proteins vertical achieved another quarter of net sales growth, led by Hormel chili, Square Table refrigerated entrees and Mary Kitchen hash, in addition to a benefit from pricing actions we implemented last year. We will have new capacity for SPAM items beginning in the second quarter. In addition to supporting our highest selling products in the category, this new capacity allows us to restore assortments, introduce new flavors such as Maple and relaunch our 7-ounce SPAM item after a 3-year hiatus. This provides excellent value for consumers seeking a more affordable option in the category. SKIPPY peanut butter sales for the quarter were significantly behind last year. Last May, when we made the decision to relentlessly support our customers and the peanut butter category, we knew it would pressure inventory levels and have lingering impacts into fiscal 2023. This was the right decision for all stakeholders, and our team deserves credit for growing the peanut butter category and making the product readily available for our customers and consumers when they needed it. Demand remains robust for the SKIPPY brand and the category, and we are working diligently to maximize capacity and return inventories and fill rates to normalized levels. Net sales declined for the snacking and entertainment vertical as growth for the Columbus and Hormel pepperoni brands was more than offset by a year-over-year decline in the snack nuts business. The final vertical, value-added meats was most heavily impacted by lower commodity pork and turkey availability, leading to net sales declines. In the Foodservice segment, products in the sliced meats, pepperoni, premium prepared proteins and premium bacon and breakfast sausage categories grew volume and net sales for the quarter. Like retail, the overall decline in volume was driven primarily by limited turkey and fresh pork availability. Segment profit increased for the quarter due to improved mix across the portfolio. Results for this segment were below our expectations, reflecting industry softness from mid-December into January. However, we have seen a sharp rebound in orders to begin the second quarter and are confident in our ability to grow the business this year. Finally, the International segment was heavily impacted by external factors during the first quarter. From a top line perspective, our branded export business had a strong quarter led by the SPAM and SKIPPY brands. We also saw another quarter of improved results in Brazil as the team continues to focus on its premium products and foodservice strategy. Commodity turkey volumes declined almost 80% compared to last year due to restrictions on turkey exports and limited supply as we strategically diverted raw material to support the domestic business. Our team in China faced incredibly difficult operating conditions throughout the quarter as the impact of COVID-related policy changes had dramatic short-term effects on the business as well as our employees, customers and operators. Taken together, the impact from lower turkey exports and disruptions in China represented a more than $0.01 earnings per share impact on the quarter compared to last year. We are seeing improvement in China to begin the second quarter especially in our foodservice business. As conditions normalize, we expect our China business to resume delivering accelerated growth. During the quarter, we purchased a minority stake in Garudafood, one of the largest food and beverage companies in Indonesia. This investment supports our international growth ambitions and the global execution of our snacking and entertaining strategy. Garudafood is a market leader with strong and reputable brands, local expertise and a best-in-class distribution network. We have been partnering with the Garudafood team for several years, and this strategic investment enhances that partnership. Jacinth will provide the financial details of the transaction later in the call. As we disclosed earlier this morning, we are reaffirming our top line expectations and reducing our diluted net earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2023. Our top line remains healthy. And despite softness in the first quarter, we are on track to deliver growth for the year. Demand for our leading center store and refrigerated retail brands remains favorable. The Foodservice segment expects strong growth for the remainder of the year, and we anticipate the near-term challenges impacting the international segment to abate over the coming months. Compared to our expectations heading into the year, earnings are being pressured by inefficiencies across the supply chain, persistent inflationary pressures and softness in the snack nuts category. I want to detail how we plan to address each of these challenges for the balance of the year. First, I would like to discuss the state of our supply chain. It is important to note that we have made progress over the last year, staffing our facilities, expanding production capacity and improving fill rates for each of our businesses. This has allowed us to catch up to demand in most categories and further supports the confidence we have in our revenue outlook for this year and longer term. Since the fall, we have been operating with elevated inventories due to our efforts to increase production, optimize plant performance and return fill rates to historical levels. We expected this inventory to clear during the normal course of business. This has not happened. And in fact, we have seen inventories continue to grow in a number of areas. This has resulted in inefficiencies across the supply chain and higher operating costs. We are taking immediate action to combat these inefficiencies by focusing on selling excess inventories and reducing the reliance on third-party warehouses and co-packers. These actions are expected to cause short-term margin compression, but they are necessary as we look to restore profitability to normalized levels and reduce complexity. Simply said, after almost three years of chasing unprecedented demand, our ability to supply our customers, consumers and operators caught up to and in some cases began to exceed demand and we needed to react sooner. Rectifying the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory levels is the top priority in the company. Second, we continue to operate in a volatile, complex and high-cost environment and cost pressures remain high. Our retail businesses, especially in the center store, continue to be disproportionately impacted by high inflationary pressures and the pricing actions we have taken over the last 18 months still lag inflation. To help mitigate some of this pressure, we have announced additional inflationary justified pricing actions in certain retail categories effective late in the second quarter. We are evaluating further pricing actions but as we have said, our teams remain highly focused on the long-term needs of the business and protecting the equity of our brands. For the remainder of the year, we believe we can stabilize these margin pressures through a combination of pricing actions, operational cost management and supply chain cost savings initiatives. Third, after meeting expectations last year, our Planters business is off to a slower-than-expected start in 2023. There are numerous factors at play including general category softness, a consumer shift away from certain higher-priced items, production challenges and timing issues. We are taking immediate action to address the current challenges, stabilize the top line and grow the consumer base. Beginning in the second quarter, we are shifting resources to drive consumption. This includes increasing promotional support and prioritizing peanut items and pack sizes aimed at value-seeking consumers. We are bringing much needed innovation to the category with flavored cashews and several new corn nuts flavors. We're expanding assortments as we continue to gain distribution for the brand. And we are investing in capital for higher growth items that are relevant for today's consumer. Long term, we remain fully committed to the Planters brand and the snack nuts category. This business is at the center of our snacking and entertainment strategy, our ambitions to grow in the convenience store channel and as we look to become even more balanced as a company. We know what we need to do to change the trajectory of this business and our teams are focused on accelerating the pace of that change. Considering these factors, we expect full year net sales growth of 1% to 3% and diluted net earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. While we have work to do the rest of this fiscal year, we cannot lose sight of the progress we have made over the last two years. We are a significantly larger company today, 30% bigger, in fact. We are a more balanced company through the products we sell and in the ways we reach our customers, consumers and operators. We have transformed our company, not only through the GoFWD initiative but with the investments we have continued to make in technology, capacity and capabilities. And we have made all of this simultaneously navigating a dynamic and volatile environment and managing through the impacts of HPAI. Our brands remain vibrant and relevant. Our strategies remain effective and our business is positioned for long-term growth. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the first quarter and additional color on key drivers to our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the first quarter were $3 billion, a 2% decline to last year. Planned lower commodity pork and turkey volumes were the primary drivers of the decrease in net sales. We have now lapped our new pork supply agreement as of January and turkey supplies have improved since the fall. We anticipate more normalized volume comparisons for the remainder of the year, barring a return of HPAI in the spring. First quarter gross profit was $496 million compared to $539 million last year. Gross profit margin declined 100 basis points as the impact from pricing actions was more than offset by unfavorable mix and persistent inflationary pressures. For the first quarter, SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased marginally to 7.5%. The company continued to support its leading brands through advertising investments. Advertising expenses were $47 million during the quarter, comparable to last year. Of note, we promoted Black Label bacon over the holiday season and the Planters brand was once again front and center at this year's big game with The Roast of Mr. Peanut. Equity in earnings of affiliates for the first quarter increased significantly compared to last year due to improved results for MegaMex and our joint venture in the Philippines. Operating income for the first quarter was $289 million compared to $320 million last year. Operating margins compressed to 9.7% compared to 10.5% last year. Net unallocated expenses in the first quarter increased $7 million. This increase was driven by higher employee-related expenses and outside consulting fees. The effective tax rate for the quarter moved modestly higher to 22.6% compared to 22.4% last year. Last year's rate reflected higher stock option exercise benefits. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is expected to be 21% to 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.40. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $204 million for the first quarter compared to $384 million last year. This decline was driven by lower net earnings and an increase in working capital. As Jim mentioned, we purchased a 29% common stock interest in Garudafood, a leading food and beverage company in Indonesia. We obtained a minority interest from various shareholders for a purchase price of $411 million, including associated transaction costs. The transaction was funded using cash on hand. We do not expect the transaction to have a material impact on our fiscal 2023 results. We are targeting $350 million in capital expenditures for 2023. In addition to the newly commissioned SPAM product line, we recently approved a [$14 million] expansion for our Columbus line of premium charcuterie products and additional capacity for higher demand Planters items at the Fort Smith, Arkansas facility. We also continue to invest heavily in automation projects as evidenced by our recently completed project supporting turkey processing at the Faribault, Minnesota facility. The project automates more than 30 difficult, highly repetitive jobs at the plant, further aiding our efforts to improve employee retention and satisfaction. We paid our 378th consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $1.10 per share, a 6% increase over last year. We ended the first quarter with $3.3 billion in debt, unchanged from the prior year. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating. As Jim detailed, we have lowered our diluted net earnings per share outlook for the year and have action plans in place for the balance of fiscal 2023. In terms of cadence for the year, we expect diluted net earnings per share in the second quarter to be significantly lower than last year. We expect unfavorable mix in the retail segment, short-term margin compression due to our immediate actions across the supply chain and for continued COVID-related disruption in China to negatively affect the second quarter. We are also not expecting a repeat of last year's lower effective tax rate. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect earnings growth compared to last year led by the Foodservice and International segments, gradual improvement in the cost environment and higher turkey volumes. We are beginning to see signs of market stabilization and even cost relief in certain areas such as raw materials and freight. As anticipated, prices on key protein inputs generally declined during the quarter compared to last year and the fourth quarter. The USDA composite cutout declined 19% compared to the fourth quarter and was 2% lower than last year. This decrease was driven primarily by bellies, which declined 26% compared to last year. Higher inventory was generally a headwind in the first quarter and will continue to affect results as we work to reduce inventories. We have assumed a benefit from lower raw materials costs in the back half of the year. Similarly, we saw a more balanced freight environment during the first quarter as demand for trucks moderated. We expect freight rates for the remainder of the year to be lower compared to last year. In addition to the actions we are taking to address inventory levels and inflation, our teams remain focused on identifying and capturing cost savings opportunities as supply chain conditions normalize. HPAI remains a significant risk facing the business. While the last supported case in our supply chain was early December, the virus continues to impact domestic poultry supplies. There is increased risk to our supply chain into the spring as migration begins along the Mississippi flyway. Assuming current conditions hold, reduced production volume in our turkey facilities is expected through the end of the second quarter before steadily improving in the back half of the year. This should be supportive of our turkey business as demand for general turkey products remains strong. Turkey markets have become less favorable as breast meat prices have steadily declined over the last month. Additionally, historically high feed costs remain a headwind for our business. Considering these factors, we expect to improve meat availability in the back half of the year to drive higher sales volumes for our turkey business, offsetting the impact of market declines and higher feed costs. Additionally, we made significant progress towards fully integrating Jennie-O Turkey Store into the company's One Supply Chain, a new operating segment during the first quarter. We remain on track to achieve $20 million to $30 million of savings on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal 2023.  As noted, last quarter, there were incremental investments planned against One Supply Chain and GoFWD. Our new business model demands this, and our strong financial position allows us to continue investing for the long term. In closing, I want to acknowledge the demanding work of all the teams across the organization to make the GoFWD initiative possible. I remain confident that once fully implemented, our new strategic operating model will better align the businesses to the needs of our customers, consumers, operators and shareholders to deliver sustainable long-term growth. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So to start out for us, the report today is not really consistent with what we typically see for Hormel. So what happened? And what are the key efforts from here to improve performance? Jim Snee : Good morning, Rupesh. We agree with you. The word that we used is we're disappointed, and these are not results that we expected. But I do think it's important that even with that disappointment, to remember just how far we've come with our supply chain and everything they've been through over the last three years. We go back to, obviously, the COVID impact when plants were shut down, and we didn't have labor. And then when we did have labor, it was turning over. And so we are in a more stable operating environment for sure. And so fill rates continue to improve, labor is better and production capacity across key categories for us is good. But as we think about Quarter 1 that -- in the context of our -- this dynamic and volatile environment is a bit more explainable. We talked about China. That's easy to understand. Foodservice had a period of softness, but their business continues to be strong and will stay strong for the balance of the year. We mentioned Planters, which we met our expectations last year, but are seeing a slower start this year, and we know what we need to get done there, and then avian influenza still battling that. So we've said since the fall, we've been operating with elevated inventories. We wanted to get fill rates up. We needed more inventory to support our expanded network. The big thing here is probably a misalignment of our inventory and our demand because we expected the inventory to clear, it didn't and it hasn't. And it's resulted in inefficiencies across the supply chain and higher operating costs when we think about product and warehouses and probably moving it more than we had expected. And so those are real dollars that impacted us in the quarter. And then the other thing is we want to be careful when we talk about inventory because as we progress throughout the year, it's not going to be as simple as just looking at a dollar amount to gauge how we're doing. Mix is huge in our portfolio. When we think about pounds versus dollars impacts of markets, a potential rebound in turkey, times when we may be building inventory to support customer promotional activity. All those things are part of our inventory mix. And really, for us, we'll be talking to all of you, just like we're doing today in a very transparent manner to say is our demand -- or is our inventory aligned with our demand. And that's really going to be the key indicator going forward. So we're disappointed where we are, but we know what we need to do and probably said the most simple way possible is that after almost three years of chasing this unprecedented demand, supply caught demand and we needed to react sooner and we didn't. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And another important point to just mention here, Rupesh, is that as we have this elevated inventory, what it does is also just delay us from recognizing and benefiting from some of the costs coming down. When we think about freight rates, markets coming down, we haven't really been able to realize those, and that's been delayed. We talked about it in the fourth quarter that we should see that relief here and those benefits showing up in our margins this quarter, and that's been delayed as well and affecting where we're sitting right now from a guidance perspective. Rupesh Parikh : Great. I'm going to slip in another question. So I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned something about learning about people, I think you said technology and processes. What are the key learnings there? And then how quickly can they be implemented? Jim Snee : Yes. I'll go ahead and start on that, Rupesh. I mean I think there's a couple of things there that we need to talk about just to level set those comments. I mean the first thing is we're a much larger company today than we were two years ago. And it's not just the Planters acquisition. That's part of it. But we've seen significant growth in our business. We haven't stopped acting on our strategic priorities. Everything that we've talked about in terms of becoming more balanced, transforming our company. We've continued to move that forward, all while navigating this crazy current environment and managing through avian influenza. And so when we say that we've learned a lot about our people. We have the right people as we've gone through our GoFWD initiative, we just need to make sure that we have them doing the right work and GoFWD will help with that. When we talk about processes, as we've integrated our businesses, there are processes that will need a refresh. When we think about inventory, pricing decisions, brand resourcing, and GoFWD will help with that as well. And then on the technology side, I'll maybe let Jacinth add some color there. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. So from a short-term perspective, we are probably just a level set, I mean, this team knows how to manage inventory. And so what we're doing in the immediate term here is just returning to that pre-pandemic discipline when we think about S&OE and the process that is aligned with ensuring that we're listening to demand signal, connecting our commercial team with our supply chain team and getting all our supply planning aligned. And so that's what we're doing in the immediate term. And then from a long-term perspective, we have made significant investment from a systems and technology standpoint with Project Orion. And we paused that intentionally as we were integrating Planters, integrating JOTS and that was purposeful to get those done correctly. And now we're now continuing that work to enhance our S&OP and our end-to-end planning and be able to leverage our technology and our people to get us to the next level. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I guess I'm a little confused as to where the inventory is building up in terms of your portfolio? And what categories did you underestimate the volume weakness. Is it bellies? Is it protein? Is it in the freezers? Because you mentioned in your prepared remarks, a lot of products that did really, really well and you talked about strong demand. So what kind of demand were you expecting? And where did it fall short? Jim Snee : Yes, we did also say that we had across all segments, some volume softness. So we certainly had a lot of brands and categories that did really well. We talked about Planters being off to a slower start. So that's a part of it. And we did also talk about that period of time with our foodservice business where we had softness. And so that, too, is part of it. The foodservice piece will experience growth for the balance of the year, less concerned about that. But it's really -- I mean it's a little bit across the part to consider is what we're talking about with our supply chain is there's a level of overproduction as well. And so as we've gotten better in our supply chain and wanted to run it more productively, more efficiently, they've been running hard, and we've built that inventory. In some cases, that inventory is not aligned with the demand. And so that's really our issue is it's a little bit across the board on the product side or I'll say the sales side. And then across on the supply chain side, this overproduction, which built the inventory. Robert Moskow : Okay. Because if I can dig in a little, Jim, like I think six to nine months ago, the issue was labor shortages, turnover, couldn't run the plants effectively enough to meet demand. And now they're overproducing? Jim Snee : Exactly. Yes. Rob, I mean that's exactly -- and I said that a little while ago, if we go back over the last three years, everything that we've been through and that -- those different scenarios of, you're right, not having people. And then when we were getting people, they were turning over. And now that we're getting people, we're keeping people. The plants are running more productively and more efficiently. And our goal is to make sure that we're getting up to fill rates, and that we do have some production capacity. So our plants have gotten better. And like I said, in some cases, they've out-produced demand, and that is definitely part of the problem. Robert Moskow : Okay. Last question on Planters. When I look at the Nielsen tracking data, the unit sales are certainly down. The volumes are down over the last 12 weeks, like 6% or 7%, but that's been consistent for the past 52 weeks. Unit sales have been down by that amount. Were you expecting a big pickup in unit sales and total sales in the quarter on stronger marketing and Super Bowl marketing and it just didn't play out? Jim Snee : Yes, I think a couple of things there, Rob, and I'll turn it over to Deanna. As we think about Planters in the short term, it is about execution, driving demand and also the mix. We've said this multiple times, and it just bears restating is that we did deliver on our year one commitments. We've maintained some stable distribution. And we've seen some channel shifting with the businesses as well. But the demand is certainly lower versus our expectations in Q1. And so as we're thinking about this business now, it's really what are we going to do in the short term from an execution perspective. And Deanna, I'll let you add some color there. Deanna Brady : Yes, sure. Thanks, Rob. Just as we think about it, we knew this business was where it was when we acquired it. And again, we were interested in this business from the snacking perspective and really is a long-term ambition for us. So when we think about plant-based protein, entertaining, snacking and our ambitions for C-store, those still remain front and center. In the short term, we do have execution challenges, in particular, our base business, which is a top priority for the team. When I also look to Q1, that was when we cut over the inventory from the prior owner. So there is some noise there and some things that happened in the quarter as well as we inherited some distribution losses right out of the gate that the team has been working against. And as we head into Q2, we'll recover some of those important distribution points that will really help stabilize the base business. We're really energized by the innovation. I was with our Planters R&D and marketing team earlier this week, and the pipeline of innovation that this team has in front of us for both the rest of '23, '24 and beyond is exceptional and really energizing in regards to where they see this business going. When we talk about innovation, you'll also see innovation launch in this quarter, both in the core business as well as in our C-store business. You mentioned Super Bowl. We did have a really fun Super Bowl ad that was really centered on peanut because we do know that the consumers are thinking about the mix of nuts and snacking right now, and peanuts are really valuable item for them. So reminding them of how much fun Planters peanuts can be as well as the protein they deliver and a great snacking option. We'll see that. It wasn't just a 30-second commercial. You'll see activation both before the event, after the event and really leads us into the quarter as we activate some of the other seasonal launches later in the year. The other thing to think about is not only that this business was starved and we've been investing both from an advertising perspective, from an innovation standpoint, as I mentioned, and then also from a capacity standpoint. So for us to grow this business, we need to add capacity, which we've invested in, in regards to tube nuts for the C-store channel as well as the club channel, and we'll see that come online here later this year and into next. We also have work to do with the portfolio. Frankly, the assortment and price pack architecture. It's a big portfolio, and we know there's optimization that will allow us to unlock growth in really, again, just thinking about where we're at with this business. We acquired the business. Last year, we integrated the business. And right now, we're executing the business, and we know we've got work to do, but really confident in what I saw this week with the teams and where we're headed into Q2 and the rest of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Larson, Seaport Research Partners. Eric Larson : So just a couple of questions. Can you provide a little bit more detail again or just remind us kind of the cadence of turkey volumes. I think turkey volumes on a year-over-year basis still have a difficult comp in Q2. And then I believe you were expecting those to start rebounding in the second half. And then also do the same thing for us with your commodity pork volumes. You should be starting to anniversary; I think when you offloaded with the new contracts, some of that commodity volume. When do we sort of anniversary sort of the adverse comp that you would have on your commodity pork? Jim Snee : Yes. So on the turkey side, the numbers that we've been talking about have come through that turkey has been down high 20s, 30% in terms of volume, and we expect that through the first half or now the second quarter of this year and expect volumes to rebound in the back half of the year. And that's all with the assumption that we don't have another significant AI outbreak like we did last year and then, of course, some events into the winter months. On the pork side, we are now just lapping that supply agreement. And so as we go throughout the balance of the year, the comps will be more normalized. Eric Larson : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, and this is maybe for Deanna. Can you give us a little -- you mentioned elasticities and where you were seeing some of the maybe more elasticity in some of your retail products. Can you give us a little bit more color on where those are and whether you may have to have some promotional adjustments on that that was mentioned, I believe, in some of the prepared comments. Deanna Brady : Yes. So it's very interesting because it's a bit bipolar in that you've got some categories where the elasticities are playing out exactly as expected. We've got other categories where the consumer has acknowledged the change in price on shelf and continues to purchase in their regular cycles. I would say where we're seeing more elasticity would be in areas that could be higher rings. So thinking of like a fully cooked rack of ribs, we've seen some demand declines there. Obviously, having other areas for the consumer to shift to, so take a tub of barbecue or a dinner entree that has a lower price ring, but still allows or meets the same consumer need of putting dinner on the table. So making sure that, as you mentioned, that we're promoting our products and pulsing in some of those areas and that we're advertising and making sure our consumers understand the value of our products and how they can utilize them speaks to the breadth of our portfolio. We've always talked about why it's valuable to have products at different price points and that meet different consumer need states, and it's exceedingly important right now. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben Theurer : Just one I had on the different demand drivers, retail versus foodservice, in particular, because if we look into it, they're both somewhat equally down in sales, but then at the same time, in foodservice, you were actually able to expand margins on retail, we saw the margin contraction. So if we come back to the whole inventory and the misalignment and demand kind of exceeding -- well supply kind of exceeding demand. Is that particularly in retail where you got these issues and this misalignment, which caused the margins to be under pressure? Or is that also something you saw in foodservice just not at the same magnitude, maybe because of mix for falls into foodservice? Jim Snee : Yes, Ben, I think the way you described it there at the end of your question is correct. I mean there are inventory issues in both, but retail is currently more. As you talked about the foodservice pricing and sales, the element of that is, and we've talked about this frequently is we have seen some commodity relief and on the foodservice side of the business, they're able to price closer to the market. The pricing is a lot more fluid. Ben Theurer : Okay. And then my follow-up, just quickly on China. I mean we all know fourth quarter, particularly December, was a very tough one with the whole reopening and cases, et cetera. But as of today, early March, have you seen like particularly in February and like signs of consumers being in a more normal environment of consumption? Is it fair to assume that, that could be an easier fix go forward than maybe some of the issues you have on the inventory side over in North America. Jim Snee : Yes. Again, Ben, that's a very fair assessment. And we said that, that we have seen early in the second quarter. The China foodservice business has seen a nice uptick or a nice rebound as consumer or Chinese population seems to be making their way through COVID and are now heading back out. So we've seen foodservice up on the retail side of the business. We're really excited about the continued innovation that we've been able to deliver. The other thing, when we built that plant several years ago, we put in a SPAM line and our SPAM business has done really well, especially our SPAM Singles business. And so we've seen that continue to grow on the retail side to the point where we'll be making some additional investments to support that growth. But your take on China is exactly what we're seeing and how we're thinking about it. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Tom Palmer : I'm sorry to belabor the inventory discussion. I just want to clarify something a bit. So it sounded like in the prepared remarks, there were some constraints in terms of sourcing pork and turkey right now, and that you're unable to produce enough peanut butter. So maybe I heard this wrong, but I don't think Planters can account for a lot of the inventory issue. So I just hope to better understand what types of products you've built up too much inventory of? And is it certain pork products that fall into that equation? Jim Snee : Yes. So Tom, I'll start with that first question. So we didn't have any difficulty sourcing pork products for production. What we have said is it\u2019s just the decline is what we would have normally had coming at us that we don\u2019t today. So we used to have to sell it. Today, we don\u2019t. That\u2019s what we are talking about for the pork decline. The turkey is -- absolutely not enough turkey coming through to support the business. But as we think about the inventory across the entire portfolio, you are right. I mean it\u2019s not all Planter. I mean that\u2019s part of it. When we think about -- as I described earlier, some of it is inventory that has been built for promotion. So think SPAM as we get into bigger promotions throughout the year. We do have elevated inventories of ribs. We have some elevated inventories of complete bacon bits. So it is a mixed bag, other perishable refrigerated items. So it's a mixed bag across the inventory that we have and the portfolio. And so yes, we're not trying to pin this on any one item or one category. I mean, it is broad-based. Tom Palmer : Okay. And maybe just on the price increases you mentioned retail. Just any detail on how much of the portfolio is being addressed with pricing? Any help on the magnitude, the timing, and then just are there certain commodity types that need to be addressed in particular? Deanna Brady : Yes, Tom, thanks. This is Deanna. I'll jump in there. So we still have wraparound pricing that's flowing through. We took several price increases last year, and some of those are still flowing through. We have a chunk of the portfolio that is currently in price increases, roughly about 5%. We've taken a very mindful approach to our pricing and thinking about elasticities, volumes, where we've added capacity. Obviously, we want to make sure that we're able to leverage that capacity. And so we've tried to be very mindful. So we've taken multiple price increases probably in smaller increments than some of our competitors have announced. And really, the increases we're taking are justified for inflation. And so -- and we'll continue to monitor that. We've got the ones, as I mentioned, that are already in the quarter happening, and we've got a few other categories that we're evaluating as we sit today. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Maybe just a first question, more of a technical question around the resegmentation. And just to level set everybody on the call, have you disclosed at all, just what percentage of the new retail business will be captured in Scanner data so in Nielsen and IRI. And I think you had a helpful breakout for retail, particularly just on the different verticals. Is there anything you can do to help us on the foodservice side? I don't think there was anything in the slide deck from Tuesday. Jacinth Smiley : So in terms of the retail component, it will be somewhere around 80%. And then on the foodservice side, I mean, there wouldn't be anything that you would actually see\u2026 Peter Galbo : Sorry, go ahead. Jim Snee : No, that's okay. Peter, we're not going to have the same kind of vertical structure within foodservice just because it doesn't -- I mean the industry doesn't even really think about it that way. What we will try to do over time is provide you more color. So for example, in this quarter as we integrated the JOTS business, and we've talked about how that is going to be a benefit to both the JOTS business and the Hormel business, a channel like K-12, our school business, had a really good quarter. So we'll continue to try to provide that type of color but from, I'll say, a typical reporting, it will all roll up just into foodservice. Peter Galbo : Okay. And then again, just to go back to the inventory side and maybe just to think about it in a little bit of a different manner. If you are going to be selling through more of your inventory or trying to get it more rightsized, I guess why wasn't there an adjustment to the sales line as well? Just thinking about if you're going to sell into more discount channels or whatever you're going to have to do? And then the second part of that question is just in your conversations with retailers, how should we think about what they're asking you to do? Is it to carry more of the burden of working capital, carry more inventory for them because they want to have less in terms of their working capital needs and just the implications as how you're thinking about it on cash flow. So I know that's a lot, kind of as a two-part question, but I appreciate the thoughts. Jim Snee : Yes. No, it's a really good question. And so no, we have not moved off of our top line guidance. We know that there's a turkey uncertainty and expect that to come back in the back half of the year. The other part of this is our foodservice business. And so even though we had some softness for a period of time in the first quarter, we expect growth for the balance of the year. So those really are two drivers. And then as we expect our international business to come back with some of those challenges abating, we do believe that we'll be able to deliver that top line. And then the second part of that question, we're not getting that pressure from retailers in terms of keep more inventory. As Jacinth said earlier, we know how to run this business. And historically, we've had very, very strong fill rates. It's obviously some of the supply chain challenges that we've had over the last two, three years that have prevented us from getting to those fill rates. But slowly but surely, we are getting those fill rates back to where they were. And so we were able to operate the way that we did pre-pandemic. That's really the expectation. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : I just want to come back to Planters specifically, when you detail some of these challenges, it's one of the three things you call out as a focus area in terms of optimizing promotional support and everything else. But then you also called out the capacity expansion, even though those volumes have been down kind of mid or more single digits for some time. Can you just maybe elaborate on what pain point the capacity expansion solves given the current situation? Jacinth Smiley : Sure. Thanks, Michael. The capacity expansion specifically addressed the continued evolution of snacking as well as C-store and club channel. So the capacity we're adding a specific packaging. That really is on trend with how consumers want to snack today, when you think about the tube nut in particular, both in a singular purchase as well as in a club variety. The additional capacity is really designed to help us continue to meet the demand, which is exceptional there. And then the other area of growth that we haven't talked about that is really a hidden gem in the portfolio is the core nut business, and some really great flavors that are coming to market. And as we think of the convenience store business, really the 100 days of summer is where that business really comes to life. So adding capacity both for C-store and club store is where we're leaning into right now. Jim Snee : And I think it's important to know, Michael, these are things that we knew when we bought the business. We knew that there was going to have to be some packaging innovation, which we did last year with the new bottle and then also some capacity investments. So it was existing packaging, but we saw that as an opportunity. It was just a matter of what the timing was that we were going to need it. And then as Deanna mentioned, we've seen really, really strong growth since Day 1 for the corn nuts business, and we don't expect that to slow down. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. And just coming back to Garuda, did you have an option for a bigger stake there? Or could you at some point? How do we think about whether or not that ever becomes part of above the line in operations? Jim Snee : Yes. I think for now, it was -- we took out the previous private equity owner. That was the big stake that was for sale. So for us, it was the right size at the right time. And again, I mean, we've been a partner with them, but it's early days, and we still need to learn about the business, about the market. We know it supports our two strategic initiatives for adding scale and snacking, entertaining and developing that global presence. And so as we go along, we certainly think there will be opportunities for us to -- if the business delivers for us to take a bigger position. Operator : Our last question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So I guess first question just on Jennie-O, or turkey, I should say, you're talking about volumes improving and starting to normalize in the back half, assuming no further HPAI, but I think and you already started to see this commodity breast in pricing coming down and that would continue if there is no further supply disruptions in the turkey market. Commodity resin pricing was actually a big margin uplift to that business last year. I know it's now getting -- it's now split between retail and foodservice international, so it's not as visible. But did your full year outlook for your turkey business profitability actually come down with this update? I just it's not clear because it would seem like turkey breast meat pricing is a pretty big -- could be a pretty big headwind over the balance of the year? Jim Snee : Yes, Adam, we have not changed the outlook for the turkey business at all. You're right that we've seen lower breast meat markets. But the turkey business is still in a very favorable position. Turkey demand is strong. The value-added portion of the business continues to do well. And as we get more meat, we'll be able to fill more of that. We know that whole birds cleared really well this holiday season. And that bodes well as we head into the next holiday season. And then I do think for us, this is all about what happens with AI, and we'll know a lot more here in the next couple of months as to what, if any, impact it will have in the business. But yes, we've not changed our outlook and feel like there's still plenty of opportunities to drive a strong performance even as the breast meat market has gone lower. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then if I could just ask one last follow-up, and this inventory question has come up in a lot of different ways. But I guess I'm struck with the new reporting structure and the new segment structure kind of there's a little bit less kind of connectivity between some of the plants and the end sales channels than there might have been before. There's always some disparity, but you now have like bacon going through two different channels versus one previously or two reporting units? And how are you thinking about kind of the ownership on working capital and kind of tying performance of business leaders to not just segment profit or sales but also whether it's a cash flow return on net asset kind of metric that I don't think has been a big part of the incentive compensation structure previously. Jim Snee : Yes. So Adam, I mean, the flow of the product through the sales side really hasn't changed. And we've had the bacon example you mentioned, we've had it going into retail, and we've had it going into foodservice the same way that we always have. If anything, this structure actually centralizes and creates less confusion in terms of who has responsibility with -- Deanna now overseeing retail. And it's really, really helpful. We do have elements of our incentive that are -- that do take into account return on invested capital. We use that more as a modifier to make sure that the team continues to keep an eye on that because we know how important it is. But we're not -- we don't have any plans to change the rate of that as an element of compensation. We feel like we've got the proper oversight to drive improvement over time. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And just for -- just to clarify or just to emphasize, the GoFWD structure hasn't in any way mudded up the waters in terms of how we look at the business and how incentives are aligned to drive the results. It actually does a complete opposite. And now there is very clear delineation and transparency in terms of objectives in driving the results and the outcome for the business.

Before I dive deeper into our quarterly results and reaffirmed outlook for the year, I want to start this morning by providing an update on the progress we have made addressing inventory levels, improving our margin structure, stabilizing the Planters business and continuing the implementation of our Go Forward operating model.  First, I'd like to discuss the progress we made rectifying the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory levels. This was a top priority in the company during the second quarter, and we took immediate actions to sell excess nonproductive inventories to slow manufacturing in areas where supply was exceeding demand to bring back outside production into our facilities, allowing us to better utilize new and available internal capacity, and we implemented several changes to our demand and supply planning processes. As anticipated, these actions had a margin impact during the quarter, but were necessary to bring inventory levels into greater balance.  For the back half of the year, we have further plans in place to responsibly manage and lower inventory levels and all costs associated with these actions are accounted for in the outlook. As a result, we expect to begin fiscal 2024 with benefits from better process control, lower freight and warehousing expenses, lower distressed sales and higher investment income resulting from an improvement in our cash cycle.  Second, we continue to make progress improving our margin structure as evidenced by a sequential increase in operating margins during the quarter, even with our actions to reduce elevated inventory levels. In addition to managing costs and driving supply chain savings through continuous improvement programs, our inflation-justified pricing actions are leading to gradual margin improvement. We have announced targeted pricing actions effective at the end of the third quarter on additional retail items and are evaluating further pricing actions accordingly.  Another way we are actively improving our margin structure is by optimizing promotional and advertising spend. We demonstrated that discipline this quarter by responsibly shifting some advertising spend to promotions, working with our retail partners to drive the best returns for our leading brands and growing the categories in which they compete. We are still expecting a year-over-year increase in advertising spend to support our leading brands. Specific to the second half of the year, our teams are focused on several projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity to further improve our margin structure, and we expect to see a return from some of these projects by the fourth quarter.  Third, we took action to improve the Planters business. During the second quarter, we regained significant distribution and placements for the Planters brand, which started shipping at the end of the second quarter. We introduced much-needed innovation to the category with flavored cashews and new corn nuts varieties. And we shifted promotional resources to drive consumption for the Planters brand. The brand saw shipments increase 8% for the quarter, aided in part by the strong promotional execution. While early, data for the latest 13-week period on a volume basis indicates that the Planters brand is outpacing the packaged nuts and seeds category and is showing positive takeaway growth for peanuts and cashews.  This summer, we are also running a national campaign for our new flavored cashews to maintain momentum for this business. Our progress during the second quarter represents a positive proof point in the turnaround for Planters. Planters remains at the center of our snacking and entertaining strategy and we are fully committed to the Planters brand, Corn Nuts brand and the Snack Nuts category. We know what we need to do to change the trajectory of the business and our teams are focused on accelerating the pace of change.  Finally, we made further progress implementing the Go Forward operating model and standing up our brand fuel center of excellence. With the structure now mostly in place, we can better resource other long-term projects including advancing the supply chain work stream of Project Orion. We temporarily scaled back some work streams as we prioritize the integration of the Planter Snack Nuts business, our transformational actions at Jennie-O Turkey Store and the implementation of Go Forward. The supply chain work stream represents some of the most important and highest-return deliverables on the entire Project Orion roadmap. We have also kicked off a series of multiyear projects such as a modernization of our order-to-cash system, improvements to the end-to-end planning processes and a pilot project to implement new ways of working across the manufacturing network. We plan to provide more detail on these large-scale and strategic projects as well as our continued evolution as a global branded food company at our Investor Day in October.  Results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations. From a topline perspective, sales declined 4% on a volume reduction of 6%. Volume declines were largely attributed to impacts across the turkey supply chain due to highly pathogenic avian influenza or HPAI in our supply chain last fall. In addition to the large headwind from turkey, net sales were negatively affected by significant pork deflation during the quarter. This had the most profound effect on the retail bacon and foodservice value-added portfolios.  Diluted net earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40. Earnings' headwinds were understood heading into the quarter and included strategic investments to stabilize the Planters business, margin impact related to our actions to address inventory levels, challenging operating conditions in China, lower turkey sales, higher feed and pension costs and a higher tax rate. Turning to the segments. Strong bottom-line growth from the foodservice segment during the quarter and the benefit from cost relief in certain areas was offset by lower results from the Retail and International segments.  Again, this quarter, we leveraged our long-standing relationships, differentiated product portfolio and direct sales team to drive growth for our foodservice business. Volume and net sales growth in the sliced meats, pizza toppings and premium breakfast sausage categories was more than offset by the impact of lower turkey volumes and lower net pricing, reflecting raw material commodity deflation. Our foodservice business remains extremely well positioned. We have available capacity to regain business lost over the last 3 years due to constrained supply, especially in key categories such as bacon and pizza toppings. We will also continue to lean into our world-class culinary team, innovative items and Food Forward mentality, all which further differentiate our business from the competition. At retail, we benefited from pricing actions and the strength of our leading brands, helping to partially offset the impact of unfavorable mix and higher operating costs. During the quarter, net sales growth from the global flavors vertical was more than offset by lower net sales across the other retail verticals. Like the foodservice segment, the impact of lower turkey volumes and lower bacon pricing were the primary drivers of lower topline results as elasticities played out better than expected in most categories.  The MegaMex business housed in our global flavors vertical had another strong quarter. Net sales growth was led by the Wholly, La Victoria and Herdez brands. The pricing actions we have taken across this business to combat inflationary pressures, coupled with commodity relief on avocado inputs are leading to significant year-over-year gains in equity and earnings. Elasticities on this portfolio remain favorable and we expect to benefit from continued distribution gains from our innovation pipeline, including Herdez brand and Guacamole and refrigerated sauces. The bacon vertical also delivered another quarter of outstanding results due to strong demand for Black Label items and lower belly prices.  Black Label raw bacon takeaway for the quarter exceeded 20% in volume sales. We are executing extremely well in the bacon category and anticipate continued growth in market share and household penetration, while benefiting from cost favorability. The convenient meals and protein verticals saw sales growth from many of its branded products, including chili, SKIPPY Peanut Butter, Square Table, refrigerated entrees, Dinty Moore Stew and Mary Kitchen hash.  Overall net sales for the vertical declined due to lower contract manufacturing results as we prioritize higher-margin branded businesses. The convenient meals and proteins business has secured additional customer distribution for the back half of the year. And our categories, brands and household penetration growth trends remain favorable. Net sales declined for the snacking and entertaining vertical, primarily due to strong promotional activity for the Columbus brand last year. Planters branded volume increased 8% for the quarter while the Hormel pepperoni and Hormel Gatherings brands grew net sales double digits compared to the previous year.  As noted earlier, we expect to continue to benefit from favorable customer resets for the Planters business and from distribution gains on our pepperoni items in the back half of the year. In the emerging brands vertical, Applegate drove growth for its frozen breaded chicken and breakfast sausage items. And the Applegate business continued to diversify its channel exposure, which is key to its long-term growth. Distribution gains in the mass channel and the strength of its e-commerce business are helping offset some weaknesses in the natural and organic channel.  The final vertical, value-added meats was most heavily affected by lower turkey availability, leading to volume and net sales declines. We expect a strong finish to the year from this vertical due to higher Jennie-O Turkey volumes and positive trends in the deli.  The retail environment remains extremely competitive and the benefits we've seen from Go Forward to better focus and resource our teams position us well to deliver our plans in the second half of the year. While the International segment remained challenged, the team drove excellent growth for the SKIPPY and Planters brands as well as another quarter of growth from the team in Brazil. Segment profit declined significantly due to lower sales in China and lower turkey export sales. In China, foodservice sales improved sequentially throughout the quarter, helping offset the difficult comparison to retail pantry loading and sales to food security programs last year.  Though we have seen an acceleration in our foodservice business, a recovery in our retail business following the COVID-related policy changes earlier in the year has been slower than anticipated. The team in China has aggressive plans in place to drive improved results in the back half of the year. Limited commodity turkey supplies and restrictions on turkey exports continued to affect results as export turkey volumes declined 50% compared to last year. With the rebound in turkey supplies, we expect this headwind to lessen in magnitude in the back half of the year. The second quarter also marked the first full quarter of minority ownership in Garudafood, one of the largest food and beverage companies in Indonesia.  Garudafood delivered returns in line with expectations during the quarter, and we look forward to further leveraging the strengths and capabilities of both companies to expand the business in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. International business is structurally sound and increasingly balanced. We are confident that the near-term dynamics will gradually abate, allowing our teams to resume delivering accelerated growth. We expect sequential improvement in the back half of the year on contributions from our branded exports, multinational businesses and partnerships around the world.  Finally, it's important to note that we are experiencing a direct benefit from our multi-year efforts to align resources to value-added platforms and reduce exposure to commodity businesses. Since 2017, we have made many decisions to align our pork supply chain to the long-term trends of the industry, guarantee supply for our value-added businesses and reduce the earnings' volatility from commodity exposure.  In this difficult commodity environment, we have benefited as a net buyer of trim and bellies. So we have absorbed significant losses on our harvest operations like others in the industry. We will continue to monitor long-term industry trends and where necessary, make adjustments that are supportive of our value-added growth strategies and our long-standing partnerships throughout the supply chain. Shifting to our outlook. We expect sales and earnings' growth in the back half of the year. Growth from the foodservice segment and an inflection in the International segment are expected to be the primary drivers of year-over-year gains.  All the businesses are expected to benefit from a rebound in turkey volumes and improved fill rates in key categories such as bacon, pepperoni, snack nuts, and for our SPAM family of products. Coupled with the progress we have made on Go Forward, including standing up brand fuel, restructuring our sales teams and resourcing the marketing teams to better support our leading brands, we remain confident in our growth outlook as we continue to meet the needs of our customers, consumers and operators. On a related front, we have made significant commitments and investments to ready the business to serve our customers in California.  As of January 2022, we have been Prop 12 compliant on a portion of our pork supply, absorbing the cost of compliance in our operations since that time. As we begin serving the important California market under new regulations later this month, we expect to begin recovering the cost from these investments. Considering these factors, we are reaffirming our full year net sales and diluted net earnings per share guidance ranges. We expect net sales growth of 1% to 3% and diluted net earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.82.  We are encouraged by the progress we have made and our team's sense of urgency to address the near-term challenges impacting the business. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the second quarter and additional color on key drivers to our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the second quarter were $3 billion. In the second half, the negative topline headwinds from our new pork supply agreement and the beginning of HPAI last year will have fully annualized. We expect a strong volume rebound in our turkey business in the back half of the year.  Second quarter gross profit was $491 million. The benefit from pricing actions was more than offset by unfavorable mix and higher expenses. For the second quarter, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 7.1% from 7.3%. Through the first half of the year, SG&A as a percentage of net sales is in line with last year, demonstrating our disciplined cost management.  Advertising investments were $35 million during the quarter as we continued to support our leading brands in the marketplace. We expect full year advertising expenses to increase compared to the prior year. Equity and earnings of affiliates from the second quarter increased significantly compared to last year due to improved results from MegaMex. Operating income for the second quarter was $296 million. Operating margins of 9.9% improved from 9.7% in the first quarter. Net unallocated expenses in the second quarter increased 6% due to higher pension costs, which were partially offset by improved rabbi trust investment results.  The effective tax rate for the quarter moved higher to 22.1% compared to 18.7% last year. As anticipated, we did not repeat last year's favorable rate, which reflected higher stock option exercises. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be 21% to 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.40. Turning to cash flows and capital allocation. Our financial position remains an area of strength, allowing us to satisfy our required strategic and opportunistic uses of cash. Operating cash flow was $208 million for the second quarter compared to $193 million last year, an 8% increase. We paid our 379th consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15 at an annual rate of $1.10 per share, a 6% increase over last year. We also announced our August dividend payment earlier last week, which will represent 95 years of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. We are now targeting $280 million in capital projects, which is in line with our historical investment in CapEx. We continue to prioritize investments in capacity for growth, innovation, cost savings, automation and maintenance. Our current net leverage ratio remains within our stated goal of 1.5 to 2x. As a reminder, our next debt payment is due June of 2024.  In April, we made an additional $15 million investment in Garudafood, bringing our minority ownership from approximately 29% to 30%. As noted last quarter, we do not expect the investment in Garudafood to have a material financial impact on fiscal 2023 results. Finished products inventory increased 1% compared to the first quarter as our actions to mitigate the impacts from higher inventory levels were offset by inventory build for SPAM promotions later this summer and as we restore SKIPPY inventories to healthy levels. As we responsibly work through higher inventory levels over the balance of the year, we expect a reduction in nonproductive inventory levels for days sales and inventory to return to a normalized range below 60 days. Lastly, we repurchased 310,000 shares for $12 million during the quarter. We will continue to repurchase shares opportunistically based on our internal valuation with authorization to purchase roughly 3.7 million additional shares. As Jim detailed, we are reaffirming our net sales and diluted net earnings per share outlook for the year. In addition to successful execution against our plans for the Planter Snack Nut business and the recovery in China, growth for the balance of the year is dependent on continued improvement across the supply chain, including delivering on our internal cost reduction goals, year-over-year favorability in commodity and freight markets and a strong recovery in turkey volumes.  In the second quarter, our fill rates saw a meaningful improvement and are now exceeding 95% across the domestic businesses. With this came higher service levels and the financial benefit from on-time deliveries, a credit to our supply chain team and the strategic investments we have made in our business. I'm also proud to report that we remain on track for one of the safest years in our company's history. As Jim noted, our team has also committed to several projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity to improve our margin structure. These projects span many areas of the supply chain, including procurement, manufacturing and logistics to accelerate, identify and capture cost savings opportunities.  Specific to the back half of the year, we are assuming incremental freight and indirect supply savings and a higher than historical run rate from our legacy cost mitigation efforts. Signs of continued market stabilization and cost relief in areas such as raw materials and freight are also supportive of our gradual margin improvement for the business. As expected, prices on key protein inputs during the second quarter generally declined compared to last year and the first quarter.  The USDA composite cutout declined 23% compared to last year and was 7% lower than the first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by bellies, which declined 50% compared to last year. Trim prices are also trending lower than the prior year and declined counterseasonally heading into Memorial Day. The full financial impact of more favorable raw material prices will continue to lag as we work through the elevated inventory and absorb higher grain and beef costs. We have assumed lower freight expenses in the back half of the year due to the actions of the supply chain team, softening industry demand for trucks and increased carrier capacity. Driver participation is above pre-COVID levels and has remained stable. These savings will be partially offset by continued headwinds from warehousing expenses as industry-wide cold storage constraints persist. The overall impact of HPAI on domestic poultry supply chain in the U.S. this spring was minimal. The risk associated with the return of the virus now appear to be low heading into the summer months.  Turkey markets moved lower in the second quarter and have continued to decline due to a rapid recovery in supply. We are again producing full assortment of turkey items, and our teams are selling with confidence into the retail, foodservice and international markets. As we said last quarter, demand for Jennie-O Turkey products remains positive, and we expect improved meat availability in the back half of the year to drive higher sales volumes for our turkey business, offsetting the impact of market declines and higher fee positions. Our team is delivering on the commitments we laid out last quarter, and is continuing to lead in the area of social responsibility. Recently, we were recognized as one of Barron's 100 Most Sustainable companies named as one of the top 5 conscientious CPG companies by Progressive Grocer and honored with the distinction of being named one of America's most trustworthy companies by Newsweek for the second year in a row.  We strive to earn and keep the trust of our customers and stakeholders every day through our actions and commitments to transparency, accountability and integrity. All of these recognitions are a testament to the dedication and hard work of our team members who are the foundation of our continued success. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : So you had been pretty clear about the headwinds in the second quarter and the focus, I think, really is more in the second half. You've reiterated your outlook there. Can you just give us a sense for -- you've laid out a lot of drivers for the sales and earnings growth, you pointed to foodservice as a key contributor there. And obviously, its earnings grew in the second quarter, but turkey and bacon pricing weighted down from -- on the top line. Is it just turkey availability improvement that really moves the needle? And if that's a key factor, can you give a sense of just your visibility on that into the second half? And just how much risk there may or may not be? James Snee : Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. I mean there's a combination of things as we think about the back half of the year. foodservice will continue to be a driver in our business as it has been this year and previous years. But as we think about the availability of turkey, when we think about some of the capacity that we now have with projects that have come online, our most recent SPAM line or expansion of pepperoni, the continued growth and performance of the Planters business, and then the other variable to consider is as we think about the back half of the year, although they're not there today, we've built in some higher markets for the back half of the year. So especially for those items where the pricing is more pass-through, you're going to have a topline impact but then all those other things contribute to both top line and bottom line. So those are the things that we really can control and that's what we're focused on as we head into the back half of the year. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's great color. And just to follow up on the pricing comment that you mentioned the pricing in 3Q, in most of the group, the pricing really seems to have peaked and there's fewer and fewer announcements like that. Have you gotten a lot of pushback? How broad of a price increase is it? Can you just give a little more color on how that -- how we should think about that? Deanna Brady : Michael, thanks for the question. This is Deanna. Relative to retail, we've taken pricing in Q2 in a few categories. We have a few categories we're looking at as we head into Q3. But we're being extremely mindful to protect both our margins, but also to protect our relationship with our customers and our consumers. I think when we approach the retailers with the right information that support the price increase, we've been able to come to terms and move forward. We've always -- obviously, it's their job to protect their margin. It's their job to protect the consumer. Those aren't new conversations to us in regards to approaching pricing. So it's really about having all the data and the facts to support what you're doing and why. James Snee : And just as a reminder, Michael, our foodservice business tends to be closer to the market with pricing than retail. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Benjamin Theurer : Just following along these lines, and I wanted to understand a little bit if you could elaborate what you're seeing more recently and what your expectations are as it relates to volume. I mean, with the pricing actions being taken, how do you feel about the volume reaction into the back half? And how much of that maybe volume recovery is then ultimately going to help you to drive some of the profit recovery you're looking for? That would be my first question. James Snee : Similar to the previous question, the turkey volume is volume that's coming back. And so as we -- as Jacinth mentioned, the impact of HPAI this spring has been minimal. We're now producing a full slate of items. We've got our sales teams focused and reengaged on selling turkey. You don't just flip a switch after a year of not having turkey, but they are focused and reengaged. And so that is, call it, new replacement volume, whatever the right term is, that's, that returning volume on the turkey side of the business. We have been capacity-constrained on a couple of the categories I mentioned earlier. So having those freed up, allow the sales team to go out and sell. And then the really good work that our team has done on Planters really has the opportunity to drive additional top line and bottom line in the back half of the year. And maybe Deanna can add some color on some of the -- maybe some of the categories. Deanna Brady : Sure. As we think about volume in the back half, we're really encouraged to have turkey back with the ability to promote. So we're out actively setting up promotions for the back half of the year with our retailers. Bacon continued to enjoy growth in the first half, and we don't see anything stopping that in the back half. The brand performed really well in regards to gaining new households as well as gaining growth in the marketplace. We'll continue to support those brands with both promotions, with advertising as well as innovation, which was planned as we added capital in the areas of bacon, pepperoni and as we think about Columbus and Planters, you'll see really advertising, promotion and media across all of those as well as innovation. So we feel good about the volume through, again, turkey, bacon, pepperoni, Columbus, Applegate and Planters as we saw some improvement in Planters most recently at the end of the quarter and have plans as we head into the back half. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping as it relates to CapEx and the reduction here in the new target. Can you explain the reason why you're lowering the CapEx? Is it the delay? Is it not execution? Is it just being more cautious on capital allocation in general? Just a few comments around that would be appreciated. Jacinth Smiley : Thanks for your question, Ben. So just to start off, we are in a very strong financial position and continue to be. As we look at the spend, the spend is absolutely in line with our historical levels. And quite frankly, I mean we've gone into the year with an expanded CapEx spend, and this is just a natural fallout that happened as you go to execute for different reasons, there is slippage that actually happens when we try to execute so many projects during the year.  That being said, we're in a great position in terms of what we've invested in our capacity for the business and also what we need to do from a maintenance perspective. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Benjamin Bienvenu : I wanted to ask about mix across each of the segments. It was a factor that unfavorably influenced the retail business, favorably influenced the foodservice business. I'm curious to understand the factors influencing mix, how much of them were externally driven? And what are the things that you all can do from an initiative or internal perspective that either amplifies the benefits that you're getting in foodservice or combats the challenges you're facing in retail? James Snee : Sure. Thanks, Ben. On the retail side, when we think about the mix, again, it's always a mixed bag. We've had our bacon business, which has had a positive impact. Planters has had a dilutive effect on mix. When we think about what's happened in China, and so -- there's a lot of moving parts across the entire portfolio even when we think about the commodity side of the business and what's happened. But I think the retail team is focused on the right opportunities to drive and improve mix. And when we think about the sales and volume opportunities in the back half of the year, a lot of those are improved mixed items. The foodservice team does a great job historically of really laddering up and increasing the value-added proposition of their portfolio. And so we expect that to continue. And then in the International business, just as China moderates and we see that inflection point and improvement as markets open up for them to be able to move more product. We see that mix improving as well. Benjamin Bienvenu : Okay. Great. On International, you talked about availability of turkey getting better. HPAI seems to be mostly in the rearview. I know it's still -- we're still in monitor mode. What is the pace of improvement that you're expecting in that business and then exports in particular? James Snee : Ben, I think probably the most important piece here is when we think back to the back half of last year, and where our volume was down of 30%. That was very, very significant. And so as we're looking at the back half of this year, we do expect Q3 to be relatively flat, maybe a slight increase. And then in Q4, would expect an increase. Specifically on the International business, there are some nuances with the Jennie-O Turkey business as we've restructured the business and moved into our Go Forward model. A lot of that responsibility was in Jennie-O this year. It's in the International business, and they've been negatively impacted by market closures tied to AI. And so we've already started to see some markets reopen, which will allow them to move additional volume and then also, obviously, additional margin with that. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Palmer of JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : I wanted to maybe just touch on the expected cadence of earnings in the second half of the year. If we go back many years, your third quarter earnings have typically been the lowest quarter of the year. I know the first couple of quarters of this year had some unusual headwinds, but it does sound like pricing actions, some operational improvements and some of the volume recovery, right, is a bit more weighted to the fourth quarter. It also sounded like maybe there's a bit more work to do on working down inventory in the third quarter.  So I guess with respect to that third quarter, should we expect 3Q to follow this historical cadence, meaning something below the $0.40 in the past 2 quarters? Or just given some of the improvements is more of a rebound expected this year? James Snee : Yes. Thanks for the question, Tom. I think there's a couple of things to consider. And historically, I get the point of reference, but I would say this is a fundamentally different business that we're operating today. And so as we think of Q3 in terms of cadence, we do expect to be marginally higher than last year. To your point about the work that remains as we said on our first quarter call, we had very clear priorities and team did a great job executing against them, but the work is not done. And so we do expect to see some of those benefits in Q3, additional benefits in Q4. So we'll -- the work is not done, team is doing a great job, but the priorities remain the same for us. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thanks for the detail. And then maybe just on the pricing side, you mentioned it's inflation-justified pricing. Maybe just some color on what commodities are the general focus for this pricing? And is this related to inflation that's cropped up in recent months? Or is this more catch-up for something that happened in past quarters? Deanna Brady : Thanks for the question. It's really a couple of different things. Some of it will be catch up, not necessarily based on markets, but it will be a collection of the input costs going into our items. We also have to factor in, we've invested into capacity, and obviously, depreciation comes at us as a result of that. So we're always thinking where we need to grow and obviously, growth has to be paid for. The other piece would be looking forward in regards to some of our markets that are a bit more annualized as we start looking into next year and where we're expecting some input increases and positioning ourselves for that to maintain our margins as well as to be able to ensure we can invest in our brands through trade and advertising. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Jim, I know we've kind of beat this topic over the head. But just on the sales and revenue cadence for the year, I just want to make sure I have it clearly -- the guidance, even to get to the low end of the range kind of implies you go from like a minus 3% in the first half to actually accelerating the sales to like 5% plus in the second half. And understanding you're lapping Jennie-O and there's a lot of other moving pieces on the volume side from the WholeStone contract from last year.  Just can you help us understand what's actually embedded in your volume assumptions by segment, if possible, but even at the full level would be helpful. And the second part to that would be just like how much of this is you need demand to reaccelerate from a volume standpoint versus you know because of pipeline fill and I think you said shelf resets that allows you to kind of get there on the volume side. So just if you could really unpack that for us, it would be very helpful. James Snee : That's a lot to unpack, Peter. I'll do my best here. I think, again, starting at the end, demand is always important. But this idea that we need some unbelievable demand acceleration, that's not necessary for us to be able to deliver growth in the back half of the year. And I know it's going to sound repetitive, but a big part of this is getting turkey back, getting that full assortment back, being able to now sell in some categories that were capacity-constrained, stabilizing and growing that Planters business. I mean those are all the things, in addition to the other parts of the business that are growing already.  And as we think about the segments that you asked about, Retail has got a lot of dynamics and a lot of puts and takes. So even if we said retail volume will be relatively flat, we do expect volume growth in foodservice and International. And when we roll all of that up, your number or your estimate is appropriate, and we've got the ability to get there with all the dynamics I mentioned. Peter Galbo : Okay. No, that's very helpful, and I appreciate that. And then maybe just for Deanna, and I know we've talked about pricing a lot as well, but like your largest customer has come out and said, hey, we need food companies to bring pricing down and again, with incremental pricing actions going in, understanding it's inflation-justified, just -- how do you reconcile kind of those comments? Deanna Brady : Yes. So as we think about the back half, if you recognized last year, we didn't have trade promotions in place. So a lot of the work we're doing with our retailers is jointly talking about category growth as well as where are the consumers at and really trying to pull strategies that leverage trade. We've shifted some dollars from below the line to above the line to continue to support promotions as well as a lot of in-store activation, coupled with advertising.  And so while we may start with a price request, we can come to the table and talk about price is only one factor and what else do we need to do together to really think about category growth as well as ensuring that the consumer is remembering what value our brands play in their life. And price doesn't do that alone. And so we really tend to come to the conversation with them, really focusing on -- that's one thing. Let's talk about that. But let's talk about how we can bring in pricing promotion as well as displays into the store, and that's what you'll see from us in the back half. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I just want to get your thoughts on a consumer backdrop. I know there's snap reduction in the market that could be impacting retail. So curious just what you guys are seeing in retail. And then just in foodservice, I think late last year, you guys may have seen a slowdown, but just curious what you're just seeing right now on the demand side in foodservice. James Snee : Yes, Rupesh. So when we think about just the consumer dynamics in general, and I'll let Deanna add some color on the retail space. But I think the one thing that we don't want to lose sight of is the fact that we've counted and we've built very intentionally this balanced business model. And so in this really dynamic environment, dynamic is probably an understatement, we really benefit from that balanced business model, whether it's premium tier, value tier, think about the alternate channels, protein inputs. I mean, there's a lot of balance across everything that we do. And that really benefits us in this environment.  From a foodservice perspective, the volume and then the business remain strong. And so the team -- recently at the National Restaurant Show and the feeling there is a level of maybe cautious optimism, but optimism, nonetheless. And as you think about, people are still traveling. And what we're seeing in all the different segments, which again, is the balance that we've built in that foodservice business as well, really serves us well. So that's why we're still optimistic about the foodservice business. We believe the demand is there. And then we also -- we believe that our focus on the different segments allows us to capitalize on opportunities as that business can shift from segment to segment. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And maybe just one follow-up question just on the available... James Snee : [Indiscernible] commentary on the retail side, Rupesh. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Perfect. Deanna Brady : Rupesh, what I'd add for the retail side is we're seeing consumers be extremely intentional about their spending, not only where they're shopping, how they're shopping, and then what types of items they're buying. As a result, we continue to see consumers gravitate towards -- surprisingly, our premium offerings. And when you think about -- so think about a party tray or Columbus circuitry board, those are items that are bringing value to their lives and are a part of their family and something that they're extremely proud of.  So parts of our portfolio may have some near-term impact, but a lot of our brands are really still very, very important. And as I mentioned earlier, that's why we continue to pulse advertising and promotions and then store activation. So that I remember the role that the brands play. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I guess my first question is on turkey. And Jim, you clarified kind of that volumes kind of normalizing without HPAI, I mean there was an allusion to commodity turkey pricing, which has fallen pretty meaningfully kind of since the start of the year. How do we think about the profit kind of contribution of turkey at this point? I think kind of coming into the year, kind of [indiscernible] its own business. I think the framing have been that, that was going to be roughly flat with volume growth and offsetting or volume normalization in the back half offsetting kind of feed costs, but kind of the commodity turkey environment has kind of come in pretty meaningfully since where you guys were in November and December. And I'm just trying to think about how that would impact the profitability of your total turkey business, which is obviously now standing between 2 different businesses. James Snee : Got it. Thanks for the question, Adam. And I do think it's the offset in terms of the return of the volumes and that tonnage increase in the back half. And you're right, we've seen markets come down, but there is that corresponding offset because we just haven't had that volume to sell. And so our ability to be able to now have the value-added products on a regular basis, whether it's the lean ground turkey and retail or having a full product offering on the foodservice side of the business, that's really a differentiator.  And the bottom line to all of this is that it is great to have turkey back. Right? So fundamentally, in our portfolio, turkey is a very, very important part of what we want to get done. And so we're glad to have this volume back, the ability to regain focus on the value-added portion of the business is what our team is focused on right now. And like I said, you don't just flip a switch when you haven't had something that's held for a year, but the teams, retail, foodservice are very aligned and focused on moving turkey again in the back half of the year. Jacinth Smiley : The other piece I'll also add there, Adam, is that the team has done a really, really good job from a supply chain standpoint. And as we -- as you think about the profitability, the yields have been really good and have improved the bird performance. And so that will definitely help us as you think about margins. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And then I had a follow-up on cash flow. And just I think there was another question about the CapEx reduction. But in some discussion also about kind of inventory dollars improving over the balance of the year. Has the cash flow kind of performance through the quarter and year-to-date actually hit your own expectations? And can you dimensionalize kind of by the end of the year, kind of what the anticipated release of working capital dollars should be? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. So I'll start off by saying, I mean, we continue to generate really strong cash flow, and we expect that to continue and improve through the rest of the year. And so that continues to give us that healthy balance sheet I talk about and just being able to flex as needed from a cash utilization standpoint for the business. So we're not feeling any different about our cash flow and our availability and ability to generate cash. Adam Samuelson : Okay. But did the cash flow performance in the period kind of actually that is what you were expecting? And how much kind of -- what is the anticipated kind of working capital release as we think about the balance of the year? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. So definitely met expectations for the quarter and the detail around your second piece of the question, Adam, you can definitely follow up with David on that piece. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Jim Snee for closing remarks. James Snee : Well, thank you. While very dynamic, the second quarter demonstrates our team's ability to do what we say we're going to do with the appropriate sense of urgency. I'm very proud of the work the team did this quarter to set us up to deliver sales and earnings' growth in the back half of the year. We are still focused on the same priorities and remain confident in our team's ability to deliver the results that we expect. Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Hormel Foods Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to David Dahlstrom. Please go ahead. David Dahlstrom : Good morning. Welcome to the Hormel Foods Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023. We released our results this morning before the market opened, around 6 :30 a.m. Eastern Time. If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. On our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jacinth Smiley, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Deanna Brady, Executive Vice President of the Retail segment. Jim will review the company's third quarter results and give a perspective on our outlook for the balance of fiscal year 2023. Jacinth will then provide detailed financial results and further commentary on our outlook. Deanna will join Jim and Jacinth for the Q&A portion of the call. The line will be open for questions following Jacinth's remarks. As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to 1 question with 1 follow-up. If you have additional questions, you're welcome to get back into the queue. At the conclusion of this morning's call, a webcast replay will be posted to our investor website and archived for 1 year. Before we get started this morning, I need to reference the safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made today will be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements we will be making. Please refer to our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which can be accessed at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. Additionally, please note the company uses non-GAAP results to provide investors with a better understanding of the company's operating performance. Non-GAAP figures adjust for the impact of an adverse arbitration ruling of approximately $70 million reflected in operating expense. These non-GAAP measures include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses and adjusted diluted net earnings per share. Discussion on non-GAAP information is detailed in our press release, which can be accessed from our corporate or investor website. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. In an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment, we grew volume across all our segments, delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share in line with last year and made further progress addressing the near-term challenges impacting the business during the quarter. This progress included reducing inventory, continuing to build momentum in the Planter snack nuts business and driving adjusted operating margin improvement compared to last year. Reducing inventory to more historical levels remains a top priority for the company. Our actions to rectify the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory are working, demonstrated by a sequential reduction in dollars of both finished goods and total inventory. The value of finished goods inventory ended the quarter at its lowest level since the same time last year, representing meaningful improvement. We expect further declines in the fourth quarter and also plan to achieve our day sales and inventory target by the end of the year. We also drove improvement in our Planters business, supported by another quarter of higher shipments and positive results in consumption data. For the quarter, retail shipments of Planter snack nuts and Corn Nuts varieties were up 5% and 24%, respectively. Retail data shows dollar consumption and share improving sequentially for the last 52, 26 and 13-week periods. Volume trends remain encouraging as well with above category performance over the last 6 months. And more recent data shows Planters volume and dollar shares have inflected into positive territory. The launch of our innovative flavored cashews is meeting expectations, and we are seeing strong acceptance from our customers. While early, our flavored cashews are overindexing with younger consumers as we see the benefits of leveraging our brand equity to drive excitement for the category. We are supporting the launch with social and digital activities as well as a national TV ad campaign. And we recently launched an LTO for the fall season, Apple Cider Donut flavored cashews which we expect to drive incremental volume and attention for the category. Momentum continues to build in our snack nuts business as we benefit from regained distribution, investments in innovation and effective promotional support. We continue to do our part as the category leader to support the Planters and Corn Nuts brands to drive growth for our business, the snack nuts category and for our customers. Lastly, we continue to make progress in improving our margin structure with adjusted operating margin slightly ahead of last year. Margins benefited from demand for our premium items in Foodservice and growth from the retail SPAM and Black Label bacon portfolios, areas we have invested in heavily over the past 3 years.  We also more than overcame the positive mix impact from strong Skippy sales in turkey markets last year, as well as a 15% increase in advertising investments to support our brands during the third quarter. We expect our highest operating margins of the year in the fourth quarter aided by a seasonally strong sales mix and savings from a series of projects aimed at reducing costs and complexity throughout our system. Our third quarter results reflect the strength of our leading brands and the value of our balanced business model. Investments into our brands and continued improvement across our supply chain have generated positive performance in the marketplace. Volume growth for the quarter was broad-based, driven by a recovery in turkey, elevated demand for many of our Foodservice items, and growth from leading retail brands, including SPAM, Black Label, Planters and Hormel Pepperoni. On an adjusted basis, diluted net earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40, even to last year. Compared to our outlook heading into the quarter, we absorbed unexpected earnings headwinds of $0.02 to $0.03, resulting from much weaker results in our International segment and supply chain disruption caused by a third-party logistics provider shutdown. Looking to our segments, our Foodservice segment delivered balanced volume gains and another quarter of segment profit growth. Volume for the quarter increased, driven by growth in our affiliated businesses and strong demand in many branded categories, including pizza toppings, premium bacon and breakfast sausage and premium prepared proteins, brands such as Cafe H, Fire Braised, Fontanini, Old Smokehouse and Bacon 1 delivered volume gains compared to the prior year. Net sales declined 3% due to lower market-driven pricing. For context, the average selling price per pound decreased 5% compared to last year, resulting from input cost deflation. As anticipated, our Foodservice business leveraged its differentiated capabilities to drive double-digit segment profit growth, led by better volumes and improved mix. Our team continues to successfully manage pricing and cost dynamics. They continue to actively engage with operators through our direct selling model and they continue to innovate to address key operational issues such as labor, prep time and complexity. Industry data from Technomic is also supportive of growth for our business, with operator sentiment steady, industry employment improving and dollar sales increasing. Inflation in the channel has also slowed for the fourth consecutive month. We expect a strong finish to the year from this team, driven by growth from premium items, further recovery in turkey, and as the team leverages its capabilities in the K-12 and college and university channels this fall. In our Retail segment, we grew volume in key categories and saw a recovery across the turkey portfolio. For the quarter, we delivered volume growth in 4 of our 6 retail verticals. And those verticals were value-added meats, bacon, snacking and entertaining and emerging brands. Volume and net sales improved for the value-added meats vertical, primarily due to higher turkey volumes. The team is heavily focused on regaining distribution of our value-added Jennie-O products and managing turkey supply through the current recovery period and upcoming holiday season. The bacon vertical again delivered excellent results due to elevated demand for Black Label items and favorable input costs for most of the quarter. Over the last 52 weeks, Black Label bacon has grown share in household penetration by 1 point each. Our strategy to offer a wide variety of both raw and pre-cooked items in the marketplace has been successful, as we grow our business in the large and highly relevant bacon category. Our team is executing our brand strategy while maneuvering through the market volatility we are currently experiencing. Volume gains for the snacking and entertainment vertical were led by Planters snack nuts, Corn Nuts Corn Kernels, Hormel Pepperoni and Hormel Gatherings Party Trays. In addition to improvement for the Planters snack nuts business, our Pepperoni and Hormel Gatherings businesses are healthy, demonstrated by household penetration gains for these brands during the quarter. We expect holiday demand and promotional support to drive a strong end of the year for the Planters, Hormel Gatherings and Columbus brands. Our Applegate business posted another quarter of volume and net sales growth, led by our frozen line of breaded chicken and breakfast sausage. Many products also outpaced category dollar sales growth during the quarter, including breaded chicken, breakfast sausage, bacon and hotdogs. The team also introduced Applegate naturals for Frittata Bites, the industry's first and only certified humane frozen egg bites. In the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from expanded distribution for the Applegate brand and from new capacity to support our popular line of frozen breakfast sausage. Net sales of global flavors items were comparable to last year, while pricing actions, operational gains and favorable input costs on avocados drove equity and earnings improvement for our MegaMex business. The Herdez brand remains relevant with consumers, outpacing category growth for dollar and volume sales in La Salsa, taco sauce, hot sauce, refrigerated guacamole and refrigerated salsa categories. Convenient meals and proteins net sales declined as higher sales to SPAM varieties and Hormel Chilli were more than offset by the difficult comparison from high levels of demand for Skippy spreads last year. We continue to gain distribution on both innovative and core items during the quarter, which helped alleviate some of this pressure. In the fourth quarter, we have numerous programs in place to engage consumers at the store level and online with reminders of the value offered by our products. These efforts are expected to help offset the impact of elasticities and as consumers utilize their pantry supplies. We also secured additional capacity for Skippy peanut butter which should help meet the elevated levels of demand we continue to see. Segment profit for the Retail segment declined due to unfavorable mix and increased brand investments partially offset by the impact from pricing actions across the portfolio, improved bacon volume and higher equity and earnings from MegaMex. Our Retail business is benefiting from market share gains innovation, new distribution, higher fill rates in key categories and effective advertising and brand support. However, there remains volume pressure in many categories across the store. Strong execution this fall and holiday season will be key to delivering our outlook. Our International segment remained challenged during the third quarter and the inflection we expected in this business did not materialize. Segment profit declined significantly due to unfavorable pork and turkey commodity markets, softness in China and lower branded export demand. Commodity fresh pork and turkey volumes were strong during the quarter, though depressed pricing led to weaker mix, especially on turkey items. The commodity environment is expected to remain unfavorable for the balance of the year due to high inventories of freezer stocks in key export markets. In China, Foodservice sales improved sequentially throughout the quarter, growing 14% compared to last year. However, retail sales remained soft as we lapped difficult comparisons to last year and as consumer demand in the retail channel slowed considerably. Near term, we expect our Foodservice business in China to grow, which should help to offset continued softness in the retail channel. Lower retail sales are anticipated to have a negative impact on China's profitability for the remainder of the year. As we've reiterated over the past few quarters, our strategy is to grow our global brands, multinational businesses in China and Brazil and partnerships around the world are sound. Our international team is confident that these situational dynamics will abate, allowing for our teams to resume delivering accelerated growth. Turning to our outlook. We remain focused on driving volume and earnings growth as well as delivering on our commitments to improve our business. The operating environment domestically and abroad continues to be dynamic and we anticipate consumers and operators to remain highly intentional in their spending. Our broad portfolio of products and diversified channel exposure position us well in this regard. As we close the year, we expect a strong finish from our Foodservice segment, incremental savings from a series of projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity throughout our system and further synergies from our implementation of Go Forward. Additionally, we expect continued softness in our International segment and earnings pressure from heightened competition at retail. We are assuming increased promotional activity this fall in the retail channel as consumer demand moderates to more historical levels and as industry-wide supply chains continue to improve. We also expect an impact from resumed student loan payments, which could pressure overall consumer spending in the U.S. Taking these factors and our performance to date into account, we are providing fourth quarter guidance and an updated outlook for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter, we expect modest volume growth, which assumes growth from the Foodservice segment, continued recovery in turkey and improved fill rates in key categories. Fourth quarter net sales are expected to be between $3.1 billion and $3.6 billion, reflecting our current assumptions for raw material input costs in the fourth quarter. Full year net sales are expected to be down 4% to flat. We expect fourth quarter diluted net earnings per share to be down from last year, which accounts for continued weakness in the International segment and lower retail segment results. Full year diluted net earnings per share are expected to be $1.51 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share are expected to be $1.61 to $1.67. We believe our continued investments into our brands, disciplined financial strategy and balanced approach across our businesses position us well for future growth as we close a challenging 2023. At our upcoming Investor Day, we plan to provide an update on our fourth quarter assumptions and outlook and further detail on how our investments and transformational efforts as a global branded food company are expected to drive earnings growth in the future. We look forward to hosting many of you in person at our mid-October event.  At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the third quarter and additional color on key drivers to our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we delivered volume growth across all of our segments and net sales of $3 billion. Our businesses benefited from higher turkey supplies and continued improvement across our supply chain. Third quarter gross profit was $498 million. Gross margins for the third quarter increased compared to last year and improved 30 basis points sequentially compared to the second quarter. SG&A expenses increased compared to last year due to a $70 million accrual resulting from an unexpected unfavorable arbitration ruling. Adjusted SG&A expenses were in line with last year. Advertising investments were $43 million during the quarter, up 15% compared to last year, as we supported our leading brands in the marketplace. We expect full year advertising expenses to increase compared to the prior year. Equity and earnings of affiliates for the third quarter increased compared to last year due to higher results from MegaMex. Operating income for the third quarter was $217 million, and adjusted operating income was $287 million, 1% lower than last year. As Jim noted in his remarks, operating income was negatively impacted by supply chain disruption caused by third-party logistics provider shutdown. Our teams did an excellent job of diverting products through other distribution centers during this brief period, though we absorbed an impact from shortages, incremental logistics costs and elevated levels of distressed inventory. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.7% compared to 24.5% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to favorable adjustments related to our fiscal 2022 federal tax return filing. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 is still expected to be 21% to 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.30 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, which was comparable to last year. We generated strong cash flow compared to last year. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $317 million, up 70%. This improvement was driven by favorable working capital adjustments. We paid our 380th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15 at an annual rate of $1.10 per share. This completes the 95th year of uninterrupted dividend payments to our shareholders. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $78 million compared to $61 million last year. We're targeting $280 million in capital projects as we prioritize investments in growth, innovation, cost savings, automation and maintenance. We have updated our net sales and diluted net earnings per share outlook for the year. As a reminder, our diluted net earnings per share outlook reflects an adverse arbitration ruling of $0.10 per share. We said last quarter that growth in the back half would be partially dependent on the recovery in our International segment. While this dynamic has not played out as anticipated, the near-term drivers for our business continue to be successful execution against our plans for the Planter snack nuts business; improvement across the supply chain, including delivering on our internal cost reduction goals, year-over-year favorability in commodity and freight markets, and a recovery in turkey volumes. In addition to the innovation, promotional and advertising support for the Planters business that are expected to positively impact the fourth quarter, we have several work streams underway to drive further improvement in future periods. These work streams encompass all aspects of the value chain and place a heavy emphasis on enhancing mix and expanding margins. The Planters business remains key to our long-term growth as a company and we will continue to invest in and resource the business accordingly. Performance across our supply chain continues to improve, demonstrated by another quarter of higher fill rates, progress on our commitment to lower inventory and execution on our cost reduction targets. Our team has committed to several projects aimed at reducing cost and complexity to improve our margin structure. In the fourth quarter, we expect to realize incremental freight and indirect supply savings and benefits from our above historical run rate on our legacy cost mitigation efforts. Longer term, we are committed to advancing the supply chain work stream of Project Orion and a series of multi-year projects aimed at unlocking earnings growth. We plan to provide more detail on these large-scale strategic projects at our Investor Day in October. We have seen market stabilization across many inputs, though key pork raw material commodity markets were volatile throughout the third quarter. The USDA composite cutout increased more than 40% sequentially during the quarter, primarily driven by strength in the belly, loin and ham primal. To start the fourth quarter, pork costs have begun to moderate seasonally. And we expect lower pork input costs compared to the prior year. We began to see a volume recovery in turkey during the third quarter, and we expect to see higher year-over-year turkey volumes in the fourth quarter. To further support our recovery, we have invested in incremental advertising to drive consumer awareness and engagement in the retail channel. We're beginning to see signs of these actions paying off, especially for the important lean ground category. Turkey market continued to move lower in the third quarter as a result of increased supply which is pressuring prices across our channels. Pricing is down considerably on commodity items and for breast meat entering the Foodservice and Deli channels. Importantly, we're producing a full assortment of turkey items, and our teams are selling with confidence in the retail food service and international markets. This bodes well for the long-term outlook for turkey, which remains an important part of our balanced portfolio. In closing, I want to specifically acknowledge our production professionals across the organization for their continued focus on safety. Their dedication is critical to the success of our company and the primary reason we remain on track for one of our safest years ever. Safety first is a cultural belief, it's non-negotiable and represents an integral part of our company's fabric. We are proud of our track record and the work done each day to maintain our standard of excellence. Thank you to all our team members who uphold our safety-first culture.  At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben Theurer : Yes. So Jim, I'd like to just follow up a little bit on the cadence of the year, the changes in outlook and wanted to get your thoughts how to put things into perspective. So if we go back first quarter, obviously, there was a lot of like the inventory issues, too much production, you had to work this through. You took a big hit and you kind of laid the ground as how the rest of the year expected to be, second quarter, very much in line with everything that you've talked about. And it feels like the third quarter started to kind of get sidetracked again. And obviously, with your implied guidance, and you've mentioned you expect EPS in the fourth quarter to be down year-over-year, that's very different from the commentary we got just about 3 months ago when you actually expected in the fourth quarter to see most of growth. So can you help us understand what in particular it was that drove that significant turn over the last couple of weeks from being on track to being maybe not so much on drag and then to actually be off track again. And what you, as a management team can do to get back into the right direction. Jim Snee : Yes. Ben, it's a really, really good question. So we've done, obviously, a lot of thinking about that and there are some things that are uniquely different and the conversation that we had at the end of Q1 and the conversation we're having today. If we take a step back, to the Q1 call, really what we were talking about were more internal dynamics, when we talked about and identified those near-term challenges in Q1. And as a reminder, as you said, it was our inventory situation, the performance of Planters and then the cost margin implications and work that we had to do there. And you fast forward 6 months from that time frame and really, really good progress against all of those near-term challenges. And we feel really good about the work that the team has done. But as we sit here today, the conversation is different, and the conversation is driven more by what's happening in markets, some of the competitive activity and really overall consumer dynamics. And so those are very uniquely different conversations. More specifically, as we've thought about the fourth quarter, and I think it's important to get that out there, what has changed for us. Well, our Foodservice business hasn't changed. We expect that business to remain well positioned, continue to deliver growth, continued segment profit growth in Q4 on higher volumes. Our International business, I think what's changed there is that it is weaker than we anticipated the last time that we talked. We had talked about an inflection point in China. And we haven't seen that, especially on our retail business. We've talked about some elasticities in our international SPAM business, primarily in the Philippines. That's a sizable legacy market, and we've seen significant pricing activity over the last several years. But with that came some higher-than-expected elasticities. The team has already done some work to really drive consumer demand. We're seeing a rebound in offtake and so there is a really good plan in place for recovery there. We've also talked about some of the commodity headwinds at International -- and so what we anticipated there is weaker than we thought. And just in total, how do you overcome that? I mentioned the work that we're doing on SPAM. The China piece, the macroeconomic issues, there's a lot of moving pieces there. And so we're continuing to work on retail with innovation, new distribution, but we need to see that accelerate. Our Foodservice business continues to do well. We're aligned with some multinational business there that continues to perform. And then when you get to the Retail segment, I mean, that's the part of the business, Ben, that's a bit more nuanced. And it's good to have this conversation because as a reminder, in Q4 of 2022, we had a really strong turkey performance in the fourth quarter of 2022. And a lot of that benefit was allocated to retail in our restated financials. That expected to be able to overcome that. And that's how we looked at the business for the balance of the year. However, we're seeing some heightened challenges across the channel. I think we can see what categories have done in general, promotions are higher as volumes remain soft across a lot of the categories, a lot of the aisles. Our team continues to do work. We're holding our shares in the marketplace. The execution at the sales level is actually really, really good. But we know that, that's going to continue to be an area that's challenged. The area where we've seen the most change really is our expectations for turkey. And as we said last quarter, we didn't expect this to be a flip to switch event and that it was going to take some time. We did expect it to happen faster. It's been a little slower than we expected. And so that's really where probably the biggest change has occurred for us. And I do want to say, though, if we take the turkey out of our volume figures, there's still really good underlying volume growth on a consolidated basis. But what changed is our lean ground turkey business. We've talked about really just getting back into business. We knew that we had to sacrifice a lot of distribution during AI, and it didn't come back as quickly as we thought. Now what I will tell you is some of our recent results are really showing the benefits of investments that we've made to drive consumer engagement. So we are seeing improvement. Lots of work to do, but lots of opportunity for growth. And then the other part for us is we did expect a really strong finish to the year on our whole turkey business. And started out strong, but most recently, we've seen some unique market dynamics and customer behavior that's really impacting both volume and pricing. Now that's a work in progress. We're still working through this as we speak. And then the last part that's newer news is we've had some really, really hot weather here in the Midwest, at the end -- middle to end of August and expected again this weekend. So we have unfortunately lost some birds that will have an impact on our business in the fourth quarter. And so I know it's a long-winded answer, but I think it's necessary to really put into context what's changed for us. But as we look past all of that, when you say what can you do to overcome that or change that? I mentioned the work that we're doing and the performance of our brands to hold shares in the marketplace. Our Planters business is definitely going in the right direction, regaining distribution, some fantastic innovation that's in the marketplace, really capitalizing on investments that we've made, being able to secure some additional Skippy capacity because that demand remains really strong. Continued benefit from our supply chain as our fill rates continue to improve. So there's a lot to be encouraged about. But your question is a good one. And hopefully, that gives you some better context as to the differences in our business but also the differences in the conversations that we've had. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Jim, thanks for all the thoughts. I guess just maybe a follow-up to Ben's question or to put a finer point on it, one of the big questions we are getting this morning is just within the range of outcomes in 4Q in your guidance, it still seems like there is a fairly wide range, a $500 million range on revenues at least. So just, I guess, within the context of that, you talked about all of the headwinds, but I guess what could go right that would push you maybe towards the higher end of that versus the lower end of that I think might be helpful. Jim Snee : Yes, it's a great question. And really, the biggest thing, and we've seen it very recently in terms of the market performance is we've had significant volatility in 2 very important inputs. You think about what's happened in the belly market, the run-up and now the softening of the market. We have seen strength in 72 lean trim. So there's been a lot of volatility there. And then probably the detailed answer that I gave a little while ago is how does turkey come back and at what rate. And then the other thing is you got the market conditions, but we've had pretty strong volume as well. So I think when you put those 2 things together, it's important for us just to have that range. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And you touched on this a little bit, Jim, but I think in the context of bellies and this may have been in the prepared remarks as well, give us a sense, something maybe in real time there. The July move was outsized even relative to seasonality. You played a role in that. But just -- you saw that run up a decent amount. It's come back a bit. Just what are you seeing in real time given that it does impact a meaningful part of the business? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, I guess what we're seeing in real time is what you're seeing in the marketplace and that it does have an impact in terms of how we are pricing the product. And as you know, as markets run up, you're always lagging a little bit further behind. And then as markets come down, you're catching up that way, too, but you probably see a little bit of expansion. And so the volatility is the thing that really as you know, leads to the unpredictability in what we're talking about. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : I want to -- if you would discuss these drivers that are negatively impacting 4Q results that have kind of evidenced themselves intra-quarter during the third quarter, what is your view at the moment on the duration of these impacts. So thinking about more challenged exports, increased promotional activity at retail and then weaker China results would -- I would think that those would have more duration in the fourth quarter, but how would you expect these things to play out based on what you've seen in the past? Jim Snee : Yes. Ben, that's a good question. And that's really what we're focused on is we know we've got some of these near-term challenges in Q4. A couple of things that we talked about that are really, we think, immediate or more closer in improvement, so when we talk about the SPAM business in International, we're seeing that improved offtake. And so we expect that business to be better in Q1. We talked about the lean ground turkey business. And so that really is just that continued acceleration. And we've seen recent improvement in that business. So that's only going to continue to get better. We're in the middle of the whole bird thing and that will shake out here between the end of Q4 and early Q1 given the timing of the holidays. The competitive dynamics in the domestic retail business outside of what we've talked about, I think our team is doing a really good job in terms of marketplace execution. We are now seeing some cost favorability trends. I think our innovation pipeline that we're seeing is really robust. So there is a lot to like outside of some of the things that we've talked about. The part that is still a wildcard is the macro issues in China. Obviously, we've said earlier, we thought there'd be an inflection point, and we were wrong. So we're going to continue to do our work there in terms of driving distribution, the focus on innovation, getting our Foodservice business to continue to grow. And so we are optimistic about what the future holds. But clearly, we've got some of the short-term challenges that we're addressing. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. Fair enough. On thinking about the Jennie-O business, there's a number of puts and takes. The International business segment seems to be negatively impacted by it, while some of the other segments are positively impacted by it. When you think about the runway over the next 6 to 12 months, we have declining turkey prices, but meaningfully stronger volumes as you regain distribution and the flock comes back, your production comes back. You should also be rotating into considerably lower feed prices over the next year. So what would you expect the net benefit or detriment of all of those various factors to be as we look out over the duration of this next 6 to 12 months? Jim Snee : Yes. I think your -- the things that you're talking about are the things that are going to drive that business into 2024. And again, when we talk about the nuances of the turkey business. And this is going to get it a little bit in the weeds here, Ben. But when we think about how maybe our lean ground business didn't accelerate as quickly as we thought, while there was some turkey that international had to sell, and those market conditions were depressed. And so as our lean ground business regains distribution and accelerates, there'll be less of that commodity type sale that they'll have to endure. And so that's a positive for us. You're right on the feed costs. I mean, we expect that to be favorable as we head into 2024 and breast meat prices should be more in line with more historical levels. So we haven't done the math yet to say how is that going to shake out in total but I think the bottom line, and we said this a couple of times throughout the year, is that turkey is an important part of this portfolio. When we think about it from a Foodservice perspective and we have it in our Retail portfolio. It's good to have turkey back. And for us to be able to operate in a more normalized environment over time, I mean, that's really where we're at our best, and that's what we want to get to. Operator : Your next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I know it's a little early, but just curious if you can give any puts and takes as you guys look to FY '24. And would you expect at this point to return to growth next year? Jim Snee : Rupesh, I think we'll probably tag team this one a bit because I think as we look into '24, it applies to -- everyone's going to have a point of view. I do think it's important to go back to some of those internal dynamics that we addressed early on in the year and that we are in a better spot on those near-term challenges or we'll call them key priorities. When we think about the state of the Planters business today, the work that we've done on inventory, the margin improvement that we've seen. And there's more work to come in that area, but we've done some really nice work and then really leveraging more of the Go Forward benefits in year 2, right? Year 1 is always feeling things out a bit, but we know that there will be more benefit in year 2. But Ben mentioned feed costs. We do expect feed costs to be a tailwind as we head into 2024, further leveraging and capitalizing on those investments that we've made and then we've also talked about the recovery in volume -- turkey volume. And so having that volume at more normalized market conditions is a good thing. The offsets, obviously, we talked about China, the China economy, what happens there? What does inflation do with labor is a big component of that. So we feel really good about the core business, the things that we can control. It's the things that are always out there that are outside your control that can be some potential headwinds. But by and large, continued strength in Food service. Retail continue to be competitive, but we expect to hold shares in our categories, I've mentioned already, strong innovation pipeline that's really exciting. And then International should improve offtake, I mean, obviously, a significantly lower base. And so Jacinth, I'll let you add your two cents word. Jacinth Smiley : Yes, certainly. Rupesh, Jim has talked about a lot of the headwinds and some of the tailwinds here and things that we're working through from a market and customer consumer standpoint, there are a lot of other things we're also doing in parallel here as we think about getting back to the margin structure that we have talked about before. And so we're heavily focused from a project standpoint, working through how do we get our portfolio more healthy. And so there are a couple of projects I'll just throw out here that we'll talk more about in Investor Day as we think about portfolio segmentation and optimization, continuing on with Project Orion as we think about our supply chain and the effectiveness there and building out the right infrastructure to support this business as we continue to evolve and modernize and just also thinking through advancing on different areas from an end-to-end planning standpoint and continuing the transformation and getting the cost out of our system internally from an effectiveness and efficiency standpoint. So there is a lot of work going on in parallel as we deal with the tactical to operate the business. We're also thinking about long-term growth and setting this business up as I said, to continue to return to a margin structure and expanding margins from where we are today. Deanna Brady : Rupesh, this is Deanna. I just wanted to tag team on that from a supply chain standpoint, but from a retail standpoint, we've been not only managing to the current environment, but continue to stay focused on standing up Go Forward and what that looks like and really starting to see the benefit. As you think about -- Go Forward was to align our structure to our strategy. And if we think of one of our company strategies of snacking and entertaining, the team has been really a cross-functional team dedicated to modernizing the Planters business as an example. The team has made significant progress, and we're seeing that play out. A few things that we've done as we pull our resources around Planters in particular, we've pulled up our innovation pipeline. We're currently in market with 3 new flavors of cashews. We've quickly come to market with advertising to support that new launch, help to surrender to the cashew, and we're having great response pulls from our retailers and our consumers. Additionally, the team has looked at capital expenses and modernizations that we need in the plant to align with the consumer and packaging as well as a really robust innovation pipeline that's coming at us. And then from a sales execution against Planters, again, as a benefit of Go Forward, thinking about hard about regaining distribution, we did a price pack architecture study in the first half of the year, and the team is out working with our retailers to help them think about the category itself and the set and that price pack architecture work is helping us have really fruitful, insightful and analytical conversations with our retailers about how we grow together and how we can both meet the consumer with products that are going to be relevant and provide category growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Tom Palmer : I think in the past, what we have seen with the whole turkey business is falling commodity prices don't always flow through the retail business immediately just given how supply contracts are structured. You made a comment about unique market dynamics and customer behavior for whole birds. I just wanted to unpack what's happening. Is the net of this that whole bird prices are coming down at retail may be faster than we typically see? Or did you mean something else by that? Jim Snee : No, that's correct, Tom. I mean I think at this point in the year, you'd see some higher bookings but as the market has declined, I think there is a bit more of a wait-and-see mentality and so that's really what we're talking about when we're saying that there's some unique market dynamics. Tom Palmer : And then just on the competitive environment at retail and your comment about the promotional activity, just categories stepping up. Are these \u2013 I guess, first, like what are the categories where you\u2019re seeing that competition and promotional activity most intense? And then how would you describe kind of the start of that activity? Is it you\u2019re running it to drive share in certain categories? Or is the promotion step up on your side more in response to what you\u2019re seeing from competitors? Deanna Brady : Tom, this is Deanna. Thanks for the question. This isn\u2019t new for us, although it\u2019s new probably over the last couple of years as companies have pulled back on promotions just because of supply and high demand. So this isn\u2019t new for us. And having promotional activity as well as a balance with our baseline business is really normal, but it hasn\u2019t been normal in the last few years. So as we re-enter promotional activity, we have the opportunity to really think about it strategically and to leverage our revenue growth management team and price pack architecture work to really inform and sit down with the retailers to say, how do we do this, that\u2019s really positive for both of us. And how do we ensure that we\u2019re meeting the consumer and that we\u2019re reminding the consumer about our products the value that they provide as well as keep them coming in the store, either in-store or online. And so we\u2019re thinking about both our digital activation, our in-store activation. And it really goes beyond just a promotion or price point. We need to make sure that we have advertising in place as well. We need to make sure that we have innovation. So I point again to the Planters example where we have innovation, coupled with advertising and promotion in place and it\u2019s working. From other categories, we\u2019re really, again, as we re-enter promotional, trying to do it as smart as we can, I point to bacon. We\u2019ve had a lot of good activity and growth in bacon this past year. We\u2019ve had a cadence of promotional activity at bacon, advertising, as well as we\u2019ve got innovation coming in the bacon category that we\u2019re really excited about in 2024. Jim Snee : And Tom, at an even higher level, Deanna gave you a great answer. When we said heightened competition at retail, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are seeing demand normalizing to some more historical levels. Edible sales flat versus last year. Units have declined since 2019. And so as you\u2019ve got that and supply chains have somewhat normalized, that I\u2019m not going to say everywhere there\u2019s capacity, but there\u2019s probably some additional capacity in the industry and fill rates get better, there\u2019s work to make sure that you\u2019re filling that up. So it\u2019s that at a higher level. And then to some of the specific activities that we\u2019re working on that Deanna talked about, that\u2019s really what we meant when we say heightened competition at retail. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : I guess the first question is trying to maybe clarify on tying the turkey comments, specifically. I think previously, I know Jennie-O is on a reported segment as such any more of a previously playing turkey profitability in fiscal '23 as being roughly flat year-on-year. Is it fair to say that, that's a decent chunk of the outlook cut today is attributable to turkey, and so that is going to be down a decent amount year-on-year even with the volume recovery from HPAI. Jim Snee : Yes. I think that's fair to say, Adam, is to be slightly down year-over-year. That's really due to some of these Q4 issues that we've talked about. Adam Samuelson : Okay. And I guess just to the Q4 point, I mean, the full year range, you've got 1 quarter left. The sales range widened relative to your prior guidance, you have the EPS range narrowed. And I appreciate that maybe there was a pretty wide EPS range previously. But can you just help us understand kind of the puts and takes around, is it just the uncertainty on some of the commodity pork cuts and some of the turkey [Holberg] pricing. We've got much uncertainty on volume. And why wouldn't that revenue volatility kind of manifest in a wider EPS range out of the outlook has been recalibrated. Jacinth Smiley : So Adam, I'd say for all the reasons that Jim talked about in terms of just the dynamic that we're seeing here and just the volatility, that is exactly why we have the ranges that we have as we sit here at the moment. Adam Samuelson : Okay. But that's certainly on revenue, but why would that change in revenue not fall to the earnings line? And why would it fall -- why would there be more volatility previously on the range of outcomes on earnings and less on revenue today. Just with 1 quarter left in the year. I'm just -- maybe it's a recalibration -- Jacinth Smiley : All mix, right, all mix driven. You think about the mix between even from a commodity standpoint and where markets are priced, it really depends on what that mix looks like? I mean you could have it a drag on the top line where you have really strong volume hitting your top line and just depending on where markets are, doesn't necessarily fall through on your margin line. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Jim Snee, CEO, for closing remarks. Jim Snee : Yes. Thank you. 2023 has certainly been a challenging year, but we continue to make great progress to addressing the near-term challenges. Our continued investment into our brands, our disciplined financial strategy, our continued balanced approach across our business all position us very well for future growth. My sincere thanks to all the hard work being done by the Hormel team to set us up for future success. And I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and hope that you all have a safe Labor Day weekend. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year for the organization as we navigated an environment that remained volatile, complex and high cost; regardless, our results did not meet our expectations. We still achieved our second consecutive year of net sales in excess of $12 billion, continued to reinvest in the growth of our leading brands, drove strong operating cash flows of $1 billion, returned a record amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, and achieved the safest year in our company's history. We also made further progress on our evolution as a global branded food company, including the implementation of our Go Forward operating model and the integration of Jennie-O Turkey Store. As we turn the page to fiscal 2024, there is urgency across the organization to improve our business. And as we outlined at our recent Investor Day, we have identified a clear, realistic and achievable path to return the business to its historical earnings trajectory. Our focus going forward is clear : first, restore sustainable and dependable bottom-line growth from our current business; second, drive savings by minimizing complexity and reducing costs; and third, capture incremental value from our investments. Our first milestone will be our performance in fiscal 2024, which is expected to be an investment year for the company. As with any year, success will be predicated on how we execute against our strategy. First, we must drive focus and growth in our Retail business, our nearly $8 billion powerhouse of leading brands, talented people and strong capabilities. Our Retail team has made tremendous progress implementing the Go Forward structure, which involved combining seven retail businesses and standing up our Brand Fuel center of excellence. Importantly, the Retail team now operates with a single vision and clear strategic focus. We expect this team to win with our consumers and our customers, better allocate our resources to drive profitable growth and improve the margin structure of the business. Second, we must continue to expand our leadership position in Foodservice. This business has emerged from the pandemic stronger, and again, delivered excellent results in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024, we expect continued growth in Foodservice. We are confident that we can accelerate growth in the key categories of bacon, pepperoni, prepared proteins and turkey. Also, we can establish a digital leadership position in the industry and expand our presence in the C-Store channel. Third, we must aggressively develop our global presence, which starts with reigniting growth in our international business. Fiscal 2023 was a particularly challenging year for our international business due to softness in China, weak commodity markets and higher-than-expected elasticities on our branded export business. While results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are assumed to remain challenged, we anticipate a steady recovery beginning in the second quarter. In fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from more normalized shipments of SPAM to the Philippines and easing of headwinds in our commodity businesses and recovery in China. As the near-term headwinds abate, we anticipate this business to resume delivering accelerated growth. Fourth, we must execute our enterprise-wide entertaining and snacking vision by unlocking the power of our brands across the channels where we compete. We are positioned to win in this on-trend category with brands such as Planters, Corn Nuts, Hormel pepperoni, Columbus and Hormel Gatherings. We have been pleased with the momentum we have built in the back half of the year for the Planters business. Data for the latest quarter shows accelerating dollar and unit sales in addition to share, household penetration and distribution gains. Much of this momentum is being driven by innovation. Our new flavored cashews line is meeting or exceeding expectations in the marketplace, over-indexing with millennial consumers, growing household penetration and introducing new consumers to the category. To capitalize on this success, we are launching another flavored cashew variety in fiscal 2024 in addition to a slate of new to market innovations. We have aggressive plans to keep the momentum going for our Planters snack nuts business in fiscal 2024, led by further innovation, new distribution, brand investments and effective promotional support. We continue to do our part as the category leader to support the Planters and Corn Nuts brands to drive growth for our business, the category, and for our customers. Fifth, we must future-fit our One Supply Chain, which means reducing costs and minimizing complexity while investing in long-term growth. We recently announced that we are converting the Barron, Wisconsin plant, which currently operates turkey harvest and value-added production lines, into a value-added facility to support growth across our broader portfolio. Harvest operations are expected to cease during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. These actions at the Barron facility are consistent with the goals we laid out in late 2021 when we first announced transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store. We are committed to building a more demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers, consumers and operators. The actions at the Barron plant further right-size our turkey supply chain, supporting consistent top-line growth, improved profitability and decreased exposure to commodity volatility. We are also committed to optimizing the Jennie-O Turkey Store System, including freeing up plant space to support growth across the broader Hormel Foods portfolio. The Barron plant is expected to support high demand and high growth product lines across all areas of the organization. Lastly, we are committed to integrating the turkey business into the broader organization to drive efficiencies and growth. Our Retail, Foodservice and International segments have been directly supporting the turkey business for a year and we anticipate this continued collaboration to drive long-term growth for the Jennie-O brand and across our entire turkey portfolio. Finally, we must transform and modernize our company, which is a critical piece to our projected growth over the next three years. At our recent Investor Day, we detailed our plans to transform and modernize the organization. Over the next three years, we expect to invest approximately $250 million in implementation, personnel, and project costs, including investments in capital expenditures and technology. We expect around one-third of this investment to be made in fiscal 2024, resulting in a modest benefit to net earnings for the year. Looking to the out-years, we are targeting $200 million-plus in operating income growth by fiscal 2026 from the transformation and modernization initiative across the supply chain and portfolio optimization. To be clear, we expect a modest benefit to net earnings in 2024, which has been factored into our outlook. We expect benefits to accelerate in fiscal 2025. We expect to achieve our target in fiscal 2026. And we expect this initiative to provide significant residual benefit in fiscal years 2027 and beyond. Through transformational work, we expect to build significant capabilities for the future. This is truly exciting work for the organization. Before I provide further color on our fiscal 2024 outlook, I want to briefly detail how we finished fiscal 2023. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion, and diluted net earnings per share were $0.36. Excluding the impact of non-cash impairments and investments in transformation and modernization, adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.42. As expected, our Foodservice segment finished the year strong, while the risks we identified heading into the quarter, including pricing headwinds in turkey, lower retail volumes and continued pressures in our International business, negatively impacted results. These results were in-line with the low-end of our revenue and adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations. Turning to our outlook. For fiscal 2024, we expect to drive modest volume and net sales growth for the full year. This growth is expected to come from our key categories, supported by higher brand investments and innovation. In Retail, we expect higher net sales across many of our verticals, including bacon, convenient meals and proteins, global flavors, emerging brands, and snacking and entertaining. We have embedded in our outlook targeted pricing actions, a step-up in innovation, and higher brand support to drive volume and improved mix. In Foodservice, we are anticipating broad volume growth led by turkey, pepperoni and bacon. In addition to higher volumes, net sales are expected to benefit from higher raw material input markets. In our International business, we expect net sales increases to be driven by the branded export business, led by SPAM and Skippy, and improvement in both the Retail and Foodservice channels in China. From a bottom-line perspective, we expect growth from the Foodservice and International businesses and expect a decline in our Retail segment. While the Retail segment is expected to benefit from sales growth and improved mix, we do not anticipate this growth to overcome the significant headwind from the rapid decline in the commodity whole turkey market. For context, whole turkey prices began calendar year 2023 at all-time highs and have since fallen below the five-year average. We are closely monitoring sell-through of whole turkeys this holiday season as well as any potential supply impacts from HPAI, which has again affected flocks this fall. These are very unusual market dynamics which has added additional risk and uncertainty to our outlook. Given these factors in turkey, we have included in our outlook meaningfully lower market pricing on our high-volume whole turkey business. Similar to the dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect earnings to decline in the first half of the year due to the impact from lower turkey markets, lower volumes in the Retail segment and continued softness in our China business. We expect these pressures to have the greatest impact in the first quarter. Taking all these factors into account, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%, diluted net earnings per share to be $1.43 to $1.57, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $1.51 to $1.65. And we expect a modest benefit to net earnings from our transformation and modernization initiative. As I alluded to earlier, we have embarked on an initiative to return the business to its historical earnings trajectory and deliver on the commitment we made at our Investor Day. To reiterate the key elements of this initiative, in fiscal 2024, we expect a year of investment, which assumes : underlying growth across many parts of our current business, offset by a significant headwind from turkey; higher salaries and normalized employee-related expenses; the impact from our new labor agreement; and higher support for our leading brands. It also assumes investments into our transformation and modernization initiative resulting in a modest benefit to the year, and it assumes capturing incremental value from Planters, our turkey business integration, Go Forward, and the investments we've made in additional capacity. In fiscal 2025, we expect to accelerate growth, which assumes strength from the underlying business, significant benefits from supply chain savings and portfolio optimization and further strategic value capture. In fiscal 2026, we expect to deliver at least $250 million in operating income growth. As we begin 2024, we remain focused on our strategic priorities, executing our transformation and modernization initiative, fueling our innovation pipeline, and exiting the year with momentum in our business segments. I remain confident that we have the right brands, strategy, people, and culture to deliver on our commitment to improve our business, and drive long-term shareholder returns and growth. In closing, I want to recognize all the hard work carried out by our team in what was a challenging year. We successfully completed a very large reorganization, made progress addressing near-term challenges facing the business, and accelerated the transformational work that will better position the company for future success. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to fiscal 2023 and added color on key drivers to our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Full year net sales were $12.1 billion, the second highest net sales achievement in our history. We also delivered $2 billion in gross profit for the year. Full year selling, general and administrative expenses increased compared to last year primarily due to an adverse arbitration ruling. On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales finished comparable to the prior year at 7.1%. Advertising investments for the fiscal 2023 year were $160 million compared to $157 million last year. We have planned another increase in advertising investments in fiscal 2024 as we continue to support our leading brands in the marketplace. For fiscal 2023, equity in earnings of affiliates increased due to significantly higher results from MegaMex Foods. Operating income for fiscal 2023 was $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion. Operating margin and adjusted operating margins were 8.9% and 9.8%, respectively. The tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 21.8%, marginally higher than last year. The effective rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be 21% to 23%. For the full year, diluted net earnings per share were $1.45. Excluding the impacts of an adverse arbitration ruling, non-cash impairments, and investments in our transformation and monetization initiative, adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.61. We remain committed to dividend growth, investing in our business and maintaining an investment-grade rating. Our consistent cash flows of more than $1 billion in fiscal 2023 and a disciplined financial strategy directly support these commitments. In fiscal 2023, we returned a record $593 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends, including payment of our 381st consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15th. We also recently announced an increase in the annual dividend of 3% to $1.13 per share for fiscal 2024. This year will be a remarkable 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. We invested $270 million in capital projects during fiscal 2023, supporting growth for SPAM and for Retail and Foodservice pepperoni. We are investing $280 million in capital projects for fiscal 2024, which includes investments in our Barron facility, investments supporting our transformation and modernization initiative, and to support high demand Planters items. While 2023 was a challenging year for the company, our strong financial position allowed us to continue sharing our successes, which included recognizing our team members for the 85th consecutive year through our annual profit sharing program. We ended the year with $3.3 billion of debt and over $750 million in cash and short-term securities. We remain in-line with our stated goal of 1.5 times to 2 times net debt to EBITDA. Before turning to our outlook, I would like to highlight the progress we made during the year reducing inventory. As we committed to earlier in the year, we achieved our days sales in inventory target of less than 60 days for the quarter and drove a sequential reduction in dollars of both finished goods and total inventory. Inventories finished the year at $1.7 billion, a decrease of $36 million from the beginning of the year. We enter fiscal 2024 with responsible levels of inventory to support and achieve our targeted fill rates with ample production capacity to grow the businesses. While Jim covered many of the puts and takes embedded in our fiscal 2024 outlook, I want to provide additional color around our investments in the business and assumptions on key raw material markets. We are investing for growth in fiscal 2024. Specifically, we will be investing in end-to-end planning capabilities, infrastructure and software to further our data and analytics capabilities, a modernization of our order-to-cash system, and incremental headcount to support the plan, buy, make and move workstreams across our supply chain. We anticipate about one-third of the total investment to be recorded in fiscal 2024. About $0.08 EPS is expected to be one-time, with the rest capitalized or included in the ongoing cost structure of the business. Shifting to the cost environment, our fiscal 2024 outlook assumes pork input cost to be higher than last year and to remain above the five-year average. The USDA is projecting modestly higher production and higher exports in 2024. Additionally, cold storage levels for pork have trended lower year-over-year and compared to these historical averages, which we expect to be supportive of pork markets. Of note, these costs are expected to continue to be a headwind in fiscal 2024 as the industry cycles through lower supplies. Turkey sales and volumes continued to recover in the fourth quarter as we grew turkey volumes in each of our segments. The investments behind our value-added turkey portfolio and lean ground business are working, with ground volume and dollar sales outpacing the category for the latest four- and 13-week periods. Turkey markets continued to move lower during the fourth quarter, pressuring prices across our channels. We have assumed prices will remain depressed in our fiscal 2024 outlook. We do expect to partially offset these pricing headwinds with lower feed costs. HPAI has reemerged again this fall, creating another unusual event affecting our vertically integrated supply chain. At the present time, we do not expect supply impacts to the degree we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2023. The situation remains fluid and the risk of additional cases creates a heightened level of uncertainty in the outlook of our turkey business. In closing, I too want to recognize the dedication and hard work of over 20,000 employees across our great company. In so many ways, our team rose to the challenges thrown at them while continuing to deliver safe and trusted products to our customers, consumers, and operators. As Jim noted, I am proud to confirm that we officially achieved our safest year in the history of the company, a testament to all team members who uphold our Safety First culture and keep it at the forefront of our business. This is a key part of the continued success of the company, one that can never be taken lightly. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Hi. Good morning. So, Jim, there's a tremendous amount of detail in the outlook. I was hoping first to, if you could help maybe just frame a little bit more clearly kind of the high- and low-end of the guidance range, which is quite wide and quite wide relative to the sales outlook which is fairly narrow. So help us, first, maybe understand kind of what happens in the market, in the business, in the external environment that gets to the high-end of the range relative to the low-end of the range, which would be a pretty meaningful step down in operating earnings relative to what you did in fiscal '23, maybe to start. Jim Snee : Great. Yeah, thanks, Adam. I think, the best place to start is to remember that, I mean, our underlying portfolio here is showing growth. And as we called out in the remarks, there is a significant downturn in the turkey business, especially in Retail, with the biggest impact we expect in Q1 and Q4. More specifically to your question about how we think about the range, the range is consistent with what we've had in the past. And we take into account all of our traditional assumptions. But as we think about what could move us higher, better-than-expected volume mix, depending on what does happen with the turkey market, we've got this fall outbreak that just continues to escalate, that can certainly have an impact going forward. The other part is, as we think about the work that's underway already for some of our savings initiatives, our ability to over deliver there. On the flip side, the same holds true on turkey markets, right? If we continue to see some of those declines, that would take us to the other side. And then, I think the part that we're all watching very closely is what's happening with some of the macro issues. In our business specifically, what's going to happen in our International business, the China recovery. When we think about price elasticities in Retail, how do those impact the business for 2024. And so, those are the things that we're thinking about and watching. But, again, when we roll this business up, we feel like we're in a good place that we've built in the right amount of risk when we think about the turkey business, the right amount of growth in the underlying portfolio which, from a retail perspective, absent turkey, we're seeing growth across almost all of the retail verticals. Foodservice will continue its strong performance. And we do expect International to start to recover after Q1. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more clarity on that range. Adam Samuelson : That's helpful. And then, maybe just touching on the price elasticity point, because I think incremental pricing actions are going to -- prove to be increasingly uncommon in the food space moving into 2024. So, any additional color or description on where those are in magnitude or are they already in place in the market? And just to confirm that excluding turkey, you think your Retail volumes are growing in fiscal '24? Jim Snee : ,: Deanna Brady : Thanks. Good morning. As we think about pricing, we've had a lot of pricing over the last two years. A lot of that pricing has been reactive. And as we sit here today, we are in a position to be thinking about it proactively. First of all, we'll be leveraging our modernized revenue growth management practices and really taking a robust look at our flagship and our rising brands, which are designed to drive higher growth. We're investing in those brands for growth. And as we think about those brands and their position in the category, we'll be thinking about the COGS and whether the commodity inputs to those areas are suggesting an increase. We'll also be thinking about what is our long-term ambition and what are the needs for us to be able to invest into these brands to continue to grow. And so, some of that will require some consideration in regards to pricing so that we can have additional dollars for trade as well as advertising and innovation. As we think about elasticities, elasticities in our mind and what we're seeing are back to the pre-COVID levels. And so, it's important that we take those elasticities very seriously because they are moving, and moving pretty quickly. The other factors that we're thinking about is our position in the category. And definitely at this point, we'll be more targeted and surgical about our reaction. And then my final thing is, it doesn't have to be price as well. There's obviously trade. And trade, prior to COVID again, was pretty -- there's a lot of categories that are pretty inelastic. And so, there are dollars to be considered from a trade perspective that we can redirect those dollars into other tactics that will enable us to grow the business. Thanks. Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate all that color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] We're not receiving any response from Mr. Galbo's line. We're moving over to the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, I just want to go back to your comments on, you talked about slowing consumer demand. So, just more color on what changes you're seeing in consumer behavior lately? Jim Snee : Yeah, I mean, Rupesh, I think the elasticities that Deanna is talking about, we know that we're back to pre-2019 level. So, we have to be thoughtful about how we're -- what levers and how we're pulling them, when we think about pricing, when we think about promotion, when we think about advertising, making sure that we are connecting with that consumer to drive the demand. But -- I mean, we also understand the amount of pricing that's gone into all these categories over the last couple of years, and it's been very, very significant. And I don't believe that consumers have fully digested all of the pricing that has still come through. So, I think it's a work in process. To Deanna's point about our positions in the category, that's really, really important as we think about those number one and number two positions that we hold. But through all of it, I think, again, the key takeaway here is this underlying portfolio, ex-turkey, in Retail especially, is planned to show volume growth in 2024. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. So, as you look at the environment for the coming year, how do you think about the promotional backdrop and competitive backdrop? Like, how do you think that evolves from here? Jim Snee : Yeah, Rupesh, I am going to let Deanna maybe elaborate on that a little more consistent with what she said the first time. So, why don't you go ahead, Deanna? Deanna Brady : Good morning, Rupesh. Thanks, Jim. It's really category by category. We've got areas of the business that I'll say are somewhat consistent with where the promotional activity has been. We have other areas and other categories where it is increased. So, think of lunch meat, think of chicken, poultry areas, we're seeing more aggressive pricing and promotion activity, which is a little counterintuitive. When we think about it holistically though, from a promotional standpoint, there's an opportunity to reset promotions to ensure that we have the most effective promotions for the consumer, for the customer, and for our brands and business. And so that's really the evolution of our revenue growth management and our pricing teams working hand-to-hand with our customers and customer teams is really ensuring that we have the best and most productive promotions out there. That's really what's going to be impactful to helping drive the business for growth and not just continue to dissolve base business and lower the category both in volume and dollars. Thank you. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? Jim Snee : Yeah, we can hear you, Peter. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks. Maybe just one quick one clarification. Jacinth, did you give a net interest expense guide at all on the quarter -- I'm sorry, for the year? I think you have a bond that's going to come due in June that will need to maybe be [refied] (ph). So, maybe if you could just elaborate on that? Jacinth Smiley : Yeah, good morning, Peter. So, yes, we do have that's coming due -- we have $950 million coming due here early June. We did not give guidance on the interest numbers. We certainly are working through and looking at options to pay down that debt. We haven't landed in a spot yet. What I can tell you though, we have definitely baked in higher interest expense in the numbers that we have guided to here for the year. Peter Galbo : Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe, Jim, in the conversation around elasticity, I guess what's been more notable is just the impact from kind of the reduced SNAP payments maybe took a bit more time to start impacting volumes than others expected. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in real time? [indiscernible] I would think at least some exposure there, but what kind of the SNAP impact has been? And then maybe when you think it starts to get better or even modestly flip to a tailwind? Thanks very much. Jim Snee : Yeah, great. Thanks, Peter. I mean, I think the macro discussion has been filled with a lot of different information. When we think about some of the economic uncertainties that are showing up in these elasticities, we have talked about the reduction in SNAP, obviously, we're talking about interest rates being high, and as rates go up, that's taking more people's money, student loan mortgages, which all of that can lead to a depleted or lower position. And -- so, what's interesting for us is, I think, again, as we go through this category by category, we're seeing different behavior in these different categories. And so, we have some premium categories that continue to do very well. To your point, I think in the short term, some of the center store items have been pressured and there could be a link back to some of the reduced SNAP or other -- the macroeconomic issues. I think, again, to Deanna's point, our job is to be able to restore that growth and how do we do that by connecting with the consumer, reminding them of the value of our portfolio and making sure that we're pulling the right levers, whether it's promotion or advertising. Those are the things that we do. And so, we appreciate and understand that there might be some short-term impact, but we also know that we know how to navigate through this situation. And then, I would -- I don't know, Deanna, if there's anything that you would want to add to that conversation. Deanna Brady : The only thing I would add is, it's very fluid. We're watching it all very closely. I was talking to Jim and Jacinth yesterday, and I commented that I didn't used to keep such a close eye on the four-week turns, but in this environment, four weeks actually are signaling things. An example is, the last four weeks in our convenient meals and protein category showed an improvement over what we saw in the fourth quarter in some of those areas where we felt that there was pullback from the consumer. And so, we're keeping a close watch really on all our categories, our consumer, and working closely with our customers to navigate the macro environment that the consumer is facing. Thanks. Peter Galbo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question coming from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on turkey again. It's obviously unusual seasonally to have some of the pricing pressure that you're seeing, but it seems maybe even a little bit more unexpected coupled with the resurgence in the avian flu. I guess, what does it take for pricing to recover? And then, you had mentioned how you've been factoring in the price pressure in your outlook. I guess maybe can you give us any sense of what conservatism is there? Or if pricing were to improve, how much of an impact that could have, and maybe just to -- try to put it in some context? Jim Snee : Yeah, I think, Michael, the question you're asking about what's it going to take. I think the turkey supply situation is in a unique situation right now because we had supply coming back. And obviously, as supply was coming back, there was a lot of work being done to restore the demand side of the business. And I don't think those were yet perfectly aligned. So, I do believe from a supply side, as we sit here today, the supply is adequate to support the business. Now, how long does it support the business? How long do some of these outbreaks last? I think that -- those are the uncertainties and the volatility that we talk about in this outlook. And so, as we do think about what we've built in to our outlook, we expect the turkey headwind across the enterprise to be about $0.10. And big part of that is it's a high volume business when we think about the whole turkey business. Again, you go from all-time high to dropping below a five-year average, and then, where does it go from here. And so, as we sit and -- as we sat and worked through it, that was our estimate in terms of the impact of the business. Now, I think the other part of this to remember is, our job is to continue to set this business up for success. And so, we continue to talk about right-sizing and optimizing this business' portfolio so that it does become more demand-driven, more value-added. Think about lean ground turkey, the work that we're doing on the Foodservice side of the business, work in the K-12 channel. So, I mean, all of that factors into our outlook as we're thinking about that in 2024. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's really helpful color. And just to follow up on the kind of three-year plan, and I guess two parts to it. So, apologies if I might have missed this, but did you quantify what the expected savings level is over the three years? And then, of the $250 million spend you called out, can you give a split of what would be CapEx versus operating? Jim Snee : Yeah, so the last question, Michael, we'll probably have David follow up on the split for you. He can have those conversations. I do want to just take a step back here and just review the work that we've been doing and the path that we've been on and why this is so important to us. We go back to the One Supply Chain initiative back in 2018. That was more structural to provide consistency and one look across the entire enterprise. Now, we followed that up with Project Orion, which was to update, modernize our foundational ERP system across our support areas, HR, finance, and accounting. And we wanted to get to supply chain, which clearly we never got to because of COVID. And so, as now we're talking about this transformation and modernization, in a lot of ways, it's a continuation of really finishing the work that we've started. And so, the order-to-cash, end-to-end planning, those things were always in scope. But as we've progressed, what we've really been able to do is enhance the work that we want to do. And so, think, portfolio optimization is something that initially wasn't in scope for us. So that is an enhancement. And so, it is a continuation in some ways. It's an enhancement, and it's an acceleration. So, we've been doing a lot of this work and our goal now is to finish the job. And Jacinth, I guess, so any of the financial numbers that you want to add? Jacinth Smiley : Yeah, no, certainly. Good morning. So, to add to what Jim has just stated here, we laid out a plan that gets us to $250 million over the three years in operating profit. And so, the way we are thinking about that, there is $200 million squarely focused on the supply chain component, which is around the plan, buy, make, move pieces of the workstreams that we're working through, and that will show up in a couple different places. Pieces may show up in our -- in COGS and other piece may definitely will show up through the -- and ultimately through the margin line, but really driving margin expansion for the business and getting us back to our margin profile and growth rate for the company. Then there is another $25 million of that, that is around the strategic value capture of the business. And then, more than $25 million or so is then the underlying core business that will grow over that period of time. So, all in all, over $25 million -- $250 million of expansion from an operating margin perspective. And it doesn't stop and we have that going out to 2026 is how we've messaged it. But what we should think about is that it doesn't just stop there, that the benefits will carry on beyond 2026. Operator : We have our next question coming from the line of Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Ben Bienvenu : Yeah, thanks very much. I want to ask about the International segment. You talked about the weakness being more pronounced in the first quarter and then that you expect it to get better after that. Just curious about your assumptions that go into your confidence level around that business improving beyond the first quarter. Jim Snee : Yeah, thanks, Ben. There's a couple of things at play there that have us confident beyond Q1. The first thing is when we talk about some of the impact of the price elasticities on our branded business, we've done a lot of work to, again, pull the right levers to drive demand, and we've been able to have a positive impact. And so, we do believe that we'll see the branded export business pick up beyond Q1, and that'll carry us through the balance of the year. The second part is this improvement in our business in China. And so, it's early in 2024, but we are seeing some moderate improvement across Foodservice and Retail. But we're expecting that to accelerate as we move throughout the year. And then, the third thing really is there was a commodity impact to International this year. And so, as we continue to build demand on turkey and other pork items elsewhere, that's less that International will be exporting at lower margins. So, we will expect to see that improvement also as we progress throughout the year. So, really those three factors are what are leading to us to have that optimistic outlook beyond Q1. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, great. Thanks very much. My second question is related to FY '25. You carved out the -- and quantified the $0.08 of non-recurring costs in 2024. Would you expect to be back to GAAP guidance in FY '25? Jacinth Smiley : Good morning. So, the short answer to that is no. So, over this period, we're executing the transformation and modernization, which we have, at the moment, [bookend] (ph) until 2026. We will be in a non-GAAP reporting methodology during that period of time, primarily to just really give good visibility to the underlying core performance of our business and so that there is no confusion there, and then to be able to bucketize the savings that's being driven by the transformation and modernization. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question come from the line of Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ben Theurer : Yeah. Good morning, Jim, Jacinth and Deanna. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is on Foodservice, actually, and just to understand how you can potentially further accelerate this business, given the strength you had throughout the year and again in the quarter. It's becoming a really important piece of the equation representing almost 50% of this year's profits. So, just wanted to understand what are like the opportunities you're seeing within Foodservice to really keep that growth momentum into 2024 as it helps offsetting some of the pressure on the Retail channels? That would be my first question. Jim Snee : Yeah, great. Good morning, Ben. The biggest thing as we head into '24 for Foodservice, a lot of the industry indicators are really stable, and in some cases, improving. And so, we think that for us, obviously, allows us to continue to run our business the way we always have, because it's well-positioned and I know it's a bit repetitive. But when we talk about the portfolio that we've designed to solve for operator challenges and limited labor, I mean, that continues to be in our wheelhouse and in our sweet spot. But then, also, thinking about innovation, in our Investor Day, we've talked about the innovation that the team is working on and introducing to the marketplace, continuing to find different categories to make a difference for those operators. The other thing is we've talked about the value-added capacity that we have in key categories such as bacon, pizza toppings, and turkey. And then, this continued evolution of the work that they're doing in the C-Stores with the addition of Planters and a more retail-focused portfolio there. And all of that's complemented by leaning into a world-class culinary team, innovation team, and really this food-forward mentality, if you will. So again, when you think about all the different pieces that can impact Foodservice, it really does remain well-positioned for growth in fiscal year 2024. Ben Theurer : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much, Jim. And then, a quick follow-up for Jacinth on the guidance. Can you give us or share us your expectations as it relates to, one, CapEx, and two, just corporate expense in fiscal '24? How we should think about these two items? Jacinth Smiley : Yeah, good morning. So, from a CapEx perspective, CapEx will be in-line with prior year, and we're expecting it to be around the $280 million mark, with some critical projects, including growth for Planters, our transformation and modernization initiative that that we're undertaking would be some of the core tenants of the major projects that we'll undertake for 2024. And then... Jim Snee : I would just interrupt there, Ben, I think we did talk about this in our Investor Day is that, we've got, as I just mentioned for Foodservice, available capacity. So, some of the CapEx investments that we've been making over the last several years, we won't have to make this year. And so, while the dollar amount remains the same, the mix of projects in there will be different. Jacinth Smiley : Yeah. No, that's exactly right. And I think as we think about how we are spending those dollars, I know year-over-year -- and I've gotten the question before in terms of the expectation that we'll spend more, and to Jim's point, because we have made such an investment over the past few years, we do have that capacity. And now those assets that are currently working for us. From a corporate expense perspective, I mean, that will be a little bit -- that'll be increased definitely year-over-year. When we think about the labor agreement that we just entered into, we're continuing to invest as well in our people. So that will increase our SG&A. And then, from just overall benefits and compensation also takes us up year-over-year. Jim Snee : And the work that we're going to do to support our brands, Ben, when we think about advertising and continuing to support the brands in the marketplace, that remains high, high priority for us. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Snee for final closing comments. Jim Snee : Yes, thank you. And I want to thank all of you for joining us today. While 2023 didn't play out quite like we had planned, there were a lot of great accomplishments that will set this company up for future success. I remain confident we have the right strategy, brands, people, and culture to deliver growth well into the future. Again, thank you for joining us today, and I hope you all have a happy holiday season. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day.",

Discussion on non-GAAP information and reconciliations to the GAAP results are detailed in our press release which can be accessed from our corporate or investor website. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, led by better-than-expected performance in each of our segments and we have made good initial progress on our work to transform and modernize our company. We also achieved broad-based volume growth across our businesses, reflecting the strength of our leading brands, robust demand for our foodservice products and momentum in our Planters snack nuts business. These results demonstrate our team's meaningful execution against our strategic priorities, the value of our balanced business model and marked improvements in our supply chain. Our first quarter results were very encouraging. We grew volume in each of our segments with overall volume increasing 4%. Net sales grew 1%, led by another excellent quarter from our foodservice team. Adjusted operating margin increased compared to last year reflecting higher gross profit and disciplined cost management. Diluted net earnings per share was in line with last year, while on an adjusted basis, we grew our bottom line and cash from operations nearly doubled compared to the first quarter of last year, a direct result of our actions to better manage working capital and grow earnings. We have a clear and achievable path to deliver earnings growth and improve our business over the next 3 years. And as we outlined at our recent Investor Day, we are focused on 3 enterprise objectives to accelerate profitable growth. First, restoring dependable operating income growth from our current businesses; second, driving savings through transformation and modernization; and third, capturing incremental value through our investments in the business. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strides we are making in each of these key focus areas. First, our results indicate progress towards restoring sustainable and dependable bottom line growth with momentum across the portfolio. Taking a closer look by business, foodservice is off to another fast start. Volume and net sales growth were broad-based across numerous categories, led by Jennie-O Turkey and double-digit gains for products such as Hormel BACON 1 cooked Bacon, Pepperoni, Austin Blues Smoked Meats and Cafe H globally inspired proteins. Segment profit increased 10%, driven by volume, mix and favorable logistics expenses. We continue to operate from a position of strength in foodservice due to our long-standing relationships, differentiated product portfolio, innovative solutions and direct sales team. This was again acknowledged by the industry in January when we received the Distributor's Choice Award for strategic partnership by the International Foodservice Distributor Association. This honor recognized our team as the most strategic partner across the foodservice landscape. We also delivered a solid quarter in the convenience store channel led by our Planters business. Volume was strong for our snacking business and convenience driven by positive takeaway for both the Planters and Corn Nuts brands. We expect our convenience store business will continue to be a growth catalyst in fiscal 2024, led by expanded distribution of our flavored cashews, innovation in corn nuts and better service levels on planters, peanuts and trail mix items. We also plan to further leverage the momentum in our snack nuts business to increase placements of our other items across the convenient store footprint. Our International business is also off to a better-than-anticipated start to the year as volume and segment profit both increased compared to last year. Results this quarter were very encouraging, particularly given the challenging conditions the team faced in fiscal 2023. We remain confident the International business will further accelerate over the course of the year, driven by more normalized shipments of SPAM and easing of headwinds impacting our commodity exports and growth from our partnerships around the world. In our Retail segment, our leading brands, execution in the marketplace and recovery in Turkey supported volume growth for the quarter. Demand was strong for many products, including Skippy peanut butter, Planter Snack Nuts, Wholly dips, Herdez and La Victoria salsas, refrigerated entrees and Hormel pepperoni which all grew volume and net sales during the quarter. Additionally, Sir Can-A data noted several positives for the quarter as we gained or maintained share across many of our products in key categories, including the SPAM family of products, Skippy peanut butter, Hormel Black Label Bacon, Jennie-O Ground Turkey, Hormel pepperoni, Planter snack nuts, Herdez salsas and sauces and Dinty Moore stew. While we expect our retail business to face incremental pressure from whole bird turkey dynamics and like many others in the industry, an uncertain consumer backdrop. Our team remains focused on winning with our consumers and our customers, better allocating our resources to drive profitable growth and improving the margin structure of the business. Underpinning the strong starts from our businesses, was improvement across our supply chain as we reverse the inefficiencies and higher operating costs that we absorbed this time last year. Our supply chain improvements resulted in lower freight and warehousing expenses, lower distressed sales and higher investment income resulting from a 4-day reduction in our cash cycle. Finished goods inventory was down on both a volume and dollar basis at the end of the first quarter and total inventory was down almost 9% compared to last year. In addition to forward progress on inventory management, fill rates benefited from the increased efficiency and overall health of our one supply chain. First quarter retail and foodservice fill rates increased compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. And our fill rates have surpassed 97% to begin the second quarter, marking the first time since March of 2020 that we have achieved this level of service. Turning to our second key strategic area, advancing our transformation and modernization initiative. This includes the areas of supply chain efficiency, portfolio optimization and data and analytics. We're in the early innings with these efforts but we are pleased with the progress our team has made thus far. Notably, within our planned work stream, we are implementing a new end-to-end planning process and are integrating new planning technology. In the buy work stream, we are realizing the benefits from our new procurement and productivity programs with further savings expected across many categories, such as logistics, warehousing and supplies. Under the make work stream, we are standardizing our ways of working across the manufacturing network. We are also continuing to take actions to optimize our refrigerated and ambient distribution networks within our move work stream. We made progress on our total company effort to improve our portfolio. Identifying approximately 10% of the items to be optimized. Throughout the year, we expect to use our enhanced data and analytics capabilities to identify more opportunities to better our portfolio. And to support these specific work streams and the broader goals of the organization, we formed a data and analytics office focused on creating easy access to reliable and consistent technology, data and analytics. Executing our transformation and modernization initiative remains a critical piece to our projected growth over the next 3 years and I'm pleased with the team's early progress. Moving on to the third key focus area, capturing value from our investments, where our progress was highlighted by the strong momentum in our Planter snack nuts business. In the first quarter, Planters volume and dollar share maintained positive momentum, while total points of distribution and household penetration grew. We also continue to support the brand via higher ROI advertising and an always-on strategy. Most recently, with the launch of the Planters Ah Nuts! campaign that went live in January. Innovation remains a point of focus for this business. One example is our flavored cashews line which is delivering against our key performance indicators and remains on track to achieve its plan for the year. Importantly, this product line continues to over-index with younger consumers which is driving new consumers and excitement to the Snack Nuts category. Over the next few weeks, we will be launching additional innovation including a salt and vinegar line extension to our flavored cashews and a new-to-market offering, Planters Nut Duos which has the potential to be a significant contributor to the Snack Nuts category. We also continue to innovate with new varieties of Corn Nuts, including Loaded Taco Flavored corn nuts and Kickin' Dill Pickle which is expected to launch in time for summer. From a profitability perspective, we continue to put a heavy emphasis on redistributing our trade dollars to higher ROI promotions and channels, while simultaneously shifting mix toward innovation and premium nut varieties. These are just some of the high priority plans we have in place to keep the momentum going for our Planters Snack Nuts business in fiscal 2024 and beyond. We continue to take actions as the category leader to support the Planters and Corn Nuts brands and drive growth for our business, the category and for our customers. In addition to the Planters business, we have many opportunities to capture incremental value from other investments and initiatives this year and into the future. This includes driving further benefits from the Jennie-O Turkey Store transformation, our go-forward initiative and the recent investments made in capacity and automation. While we realize that 1 quarter does not make a year and there remains significant work ahead, we are confident that we are on the right track to deliver on our commitment to improve our business and increase long-term shareholder returns. Now shifting to our outlook. We are reaffirming our full year net sales and earnings expectations. From a top line perspective, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%. This continues to assume volume growth in key categories, higher brand support and innovation and our current assumptions for raw material input costs. In retail, we expect higher net sales across many of our verticals. Targeted retail pricing actions will be effective by the end of the second quarter and are expected to impact our results in the back half of the year. In foodservice, we expect broad volume growth similar to the first quarter, led by turkey, pepperoni and bacon. This volume growth, coupled with higher raw material input markets year-over-year should support net sales gains. We expect net sales increases in our international business to be driven by the branded export business led by refrigerated items, Skippy and SPAM and the retail and foodservice channels in China. From a bottom line perspective, we are also reaffirming our diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlooks. Consistent with our initial outlook, we expect continued growth in foodservice. Improvement in our international business and benefits from innovation in retail. Our full year outlook also assumes higher salaries, normalized employee-related expenses and costs associated with planned investments in the business. Diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share are expected to decline year-over-year in the second quarter and grow in the back half of the year. At a high level, we are assuming our stronger-than-expected start to be partially offset by incremental earnings pressure coming from our whole bird turkey business. Jacinth will provide further details on these assumptions in her remarks. Taking all these factors into account for the full year, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%. Diluted net earnings per share to be $1.43 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $1.51 to $1.65. And we expect a benefit to net earnings from our transformation and modernization initiative. In closing, our strong start to the year reflects our team's ability to execute our clear and achievable plan. We remain focused on our strategic priorities and delivering on our commitment to improve our business and drive long-term shareholder returns. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the first quarter and additional color on key assumptions and our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, led by better-than-expected performance in each of our business segments. During the first quarter, we grew volume 4% and across all of our segments. Net sales for the first quarter were $3 billion, a 1% increase compared to the previous year. Gross profit increased 3% driven by higher net sales and lower logistics expenses. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 17% compared to 16.7% last year and 16.1% in the fourth quarter. Both our retail and foodservice teams drove better margins quarter-over-quarter and compared to last year. First quarter SG&A increased 8%, reflecting incremental investment in our transformation and modernization initiative and higher employee-related expenses. Adjusted SG&A as a percent of net sales was marginally higher compared to last year. Advertising investments are expected to be up significantly in the second quarter and increase for the full year. We are actively supporting our brands in the marketplace, including the SPAM, Planters and Hormel Chili brands. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 3%, primarily due to the inclusion of minority interest in Garudafood and growth from our partnership in the Philippines. Operating income for the first quarter was $284 million and adjusted operating income was $295 million. Adjusted operating margin of 9.8% increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. The effective tax rate was 23.4% compared to 22.6% for the previous year. Our prior year effective tax rate benefited from the impact of certain discrete items and higher federal deductions. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be between 21% and 23%. The net result of all these factors was diluted net earnings per share of $0.40 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41. Upside this past quarter compared to our expectations was driven by broad-based volume growth, strong results for all of our businesses, improvement across supply chain and below-the-line favorability. Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow of $404 million increased 98% compared to last year. This was a direct result of our successful actions to rectify the inefficiencies caused by elevated inventory levels last year and underlying business growth. Overall, we drove a 4-day reduction in our cash conversion cycle. We paid our 382nd consecutive quarterly dividend effective February 15 at an annual rate of $1.13 per share, an increase of 3%. We invested $47 million in capital projects during the first quarter, including investments in our Jennie-O Turkey store transformation. Our outlook for capital expenditures in 2024 remains at $280 million. We ended the first quarter with $982 million in cash and short-term investments and $3.3 billion of debt. We plan to utilize a combination of cash on hand and debt issued in the second quarter to pay our $950 million note due in June. We have accounted for a higher interest expense in our outlook and expect to remain within our stated goal of 1.5x to 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. I would like to further highlight the progress we have been making on our transformation and modernization initiative which is expected to drive at least $200 million in operating income by 2026. Through the first quarter, we made great progress and remain on track to capture our full year savings target for fiscal 2024. The work has intensified in the second quarter with the expectation that savings capture will accelerate throughout the year. This year, we are highly confident in our ability to capture direct savings from our productivity programs which are targeting packaging, ingredients and other supply categories. Continued benefits from the work we have done lowering logistics expenses across our network, including lower contracted freight rates, optimized routes, increased truck weights and reduced reliance on third-party warehousing. Benefits from lower distressed sales as we make improvements to our inventory management planning and manufacturing processes. Value derived from new capabilities and ways of working, including integrated business planning and from the implementation of our standardized and proprietary manufacturing system across our network and benefit from minimizing complexity and reducing costs through portfolio optimization. This is a truly exciting and important time for our company as we build toward our future. Transitioning to our outlook. We are reaffirming our full year net sales and earnings expectations. The supplement what Jim reviewed earlier, I will share some additional color on our assumptions for the rest of the year. From a pork perspective, our outlook remains unchanged. The USDA is projecting modestly higher production and exports in 2024. Cold storage levels for pork continued to trend below last year and historical averages which we expect to be supportive of pork markets. We assumed full year pork input costs to be higher than last year and remain above 5-year averages. Specific to turkey, overall inventory levels have recovered despite lingering impacts from cases of HPAI in the fall and early winter. Barring a significant supply disruption this spring from additional outbreaks of HPAI, we are in a strong position to service our customers and attract new business opportunities. We made good progress regaining value-added Turkey distribution in the retail and foodservice channels during the first quarter and we expect this to continue for the rest of fiscal 2024. On the commodity side of the business, whole bird turkey markets have stabilized below our initial forecast. Consequently, we have included in our outlook, incremental earnings pressure from lower-than-expected market pricing. We began absorbing this impact in the first quarter and expect continued pressure for the balance of the year. Net-net, we now expect approximately $0.15 of earnings headwinds from our Turkey business in fiscal 2024 which is an update to the $0.10 impact we called out on our fourth quarter earnings call. Most of this $0.15 headwind will impact quarters 2 through 4. In the second quarter, we expect earnings to be lower compared to last year and lower relative to our expectations heading into the year primarily related to our whole bird turkey business. We remain confident in our growth outlook for the second half of the year, expecting all segments to deliver profit improvement in addition to benefits from our transformation and modernization initiative. To wrap up our commentary this morning, I want to extend my gratitude to each and every member of our dedicated team. Your hard work has been instrumental in delivering a strong start to the year and contributing to the momentum in achieving our strategic objectives to improve our business for the long term. At this time, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So just going back to the Q1 performance, it was clearly ahead of expectation. So I was just hoping for more color in terms of what drove the outperformance? Jim Snee : Yes. Q1 was a very strong performance for the company. And it really is -- what's so exciting for us is it was so broad-based. When we think about all the different areas, I mean, clearly, volume is a very positive story. We saw volume growth in each segment. When we think about retail and what's happening in the retail environment, we knew Turkey volumes were going to be positive. But even when we take that, that out and some of our other non-track businesses, retail volumes were up year-over-year. Foodservice had a very strong quarter. They continue to really perform in the marketplace. And so across all of the businesses, really, really great to see them have a successful and strong Q1. And the other thing that we've spent a lot of time talking about is our supply chain. And we've did see marked improvement in our supply chain in Q1. A year ago, we were talking about inventory and we've really been able to get that under our control. We've seen lower inventory volume and dollars which obviously has a positive impact when we think about distressed sales. The other piece that's really, really exciting for us is seeing what we're getting done on fill rates. And we talked about it in the prepared remarks that we've got the highest fill rate since 2020. And then obviously, there were some below-the-line favorability as well. But when we wrap it all up, I think the key takeaway here is, we're executing our strategy and we have confidence that the business will keep moving in the right direction throughout 2024. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. So as we look at the outlook for the year, what are the key risks that you see in delivering those targets? Jim Snee : Yes. I think we tried to be pretty specific in regards to the risk that Turkey presents to us. We know that the whole bird outlook is worse and we've built in another nickle with -- most of that occurring in Q2. But the other part really is the consumer environment which we're watching very closely. As we think about our business, our shares are solid. We're making advertising investments to support the brands, driving some great innovation but we know that there are categories that are weak and we are watching those volumes. But we're doing all the right things to make sure that we're driving our shares and supporting the brands. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman at JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : I just wanted to clarify something. Last quarter, your slide presentation said to expect back half profit growth in all 3 segments. Today, I think you're saying you'll just see profit improvement. Maybe it's just semantics but I'm just trying to get a sense, do you still expect each segment's profits to increase year-on-year in the back half where now the messaging just will improve sequentially and maybe not all be up year-on-year. Again, maybe just semantics. Jim Snee : Yes. Great question, Ken. Thanks for asking it. But we do expect profit growth in all segments in the back half of the year. Ken Goldman : Perfect. And then just on foodservice. Obviously, your tone is pretty strong here. There are some more macro indications that on the edge, some slowdown in restaurant demand is out there. Last quarter, you were seeing higher checks despite traffic softness. You still saw restaurants staffed for all hours. I'm just curious, are there any amendments at all, I guess and how you view the away-from-home situation from a macro perspective or any of those KPIs that you look at? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean we're watching all those things, Ken. The other part, obviously, in Q1, is there were some weather-related events that also have an issue. But from where we sit and if you heard us say many, many times, as we do believe that we have working from such a advantaged position in our foodservice business. Because it's not just the restaurant and hotel business. Right? We have a significant non-commercial business as well. We've spent a lot of time talking about sea stores continue to grow and obviously, the acquisition and execution against the Planters brand helps us in that regard. But even in the more traditional restaurant business, we still feel like we're operating from a position of strength because of this differentiated value-added portfolio, the relationships that we've built over 30 years and really thinking about how can we help the operator take cost out of their system. And we do that through our direct selling organization. So yes, we're watching all those macro factors. We know they're real. But I think the way that we've diversified and balanced the business even within our Foodservice segment is what really helps set us apart. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Just was -- you've got -- just was looking at the volume gains across all segments. That are [ph] defined in food these days but certainly, a couple of them had some price pressure. How are you thinking about pricing? You mentioned a couple of targeted actions coming this second quarter. But can you give us a sense of magnitude or where those might be and just how you think about the rest of the year? Jim Snee : Yes. Great question, Michael. And actually, the conversation does go back to what we said in Q4 and in our outlook for the year we had, specially mentioned some targeted pricing. But I think to go along with that which is really, really important is that we are investing in our brands and where we've invested higher advertising dollars to drive volume, to improve mix, we've got some great innovation that continues to be generated across many of the brands. And so it is -- it's broad-based pricing. Some of it's wrap around pricing. And just wanted to make sure that, that was clear that it wasn't new that we are going back to Q4 and I think what I'll do is maybe turn it over to Deanna to give you maybe some more specifics on what she's seeing in the retail environment. Deanna Brady : Just to clarify, it really is very targeted pricing and a few key categories where beef is the main driver. So we've lagged in pricing in some of our grocery items relative to where beef has moved, we've taken some target pricing. With that in mind, though, we've been able to shift dollars from advertising to ensure that, that we're talking to the consumer about the products, the value and the role they play in their lives, particularly for lunch and dinner is really great options. So we've been able to pivot and turn on advertising. And in those categories like [indiscernible]; the ROI on advertising is extremely high. And so it's a really important strategy for us. We're also looking at promotions and thinking about with these different pricing on shelf adjusting our promotional strategy and thinking about depth and frequency of promotion to really get the right price for the consumer to stay in the category with us. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's great color. And you mentioned the incremental headwinds on turkey from extended price pressure or worse than expected. Sorry, if I might have missed it and I know you touched on pretty much broad strength in at least the first quarter but what's the offset for that? Is it just sort of everything else? Or is there anything in particular that really is kind of keeping you to hold guidance that covers the extra pressure in turkey? Jim Snee : Yes. Michael, I mean, first of all, I want to apologize. I misspoke because I said that it was both targeted and broad-based pricing but it is very targeted pricing which Deanna corrected me on. So when we think about the turkey situation and the reason we are where we are with guidance is, it's early. And for all the factors that we've talked about from some of our earlier questions, obviously, foodservice is off to a great start. The Q1 performance demonstrates the business improvement. Our international team had a really strong first quarter and that exceeded our expectations. They've gotten back on track a little sooner than we thought. And so that's what's going to offset that additional headwind coming from the turkey market. But in regards to just overall guidance, the biggest thing is it's early. Operator : The next question comes from Tom Palmer at Citi. Tom Palmer : I wanted to ask on or just clarify, I guess, the expected earnings outlook as the year progresses. So you're guiding for the decline in second quarter year-over-year and then an increase in the second half. I just want to clarify, is that you're looking for an increase in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter? Or might that be more weighted to one of those two? Jim Snee : Yes. I mean the way we're thinking about it right now, Tom, is it's -- we're looking at half 2 in totality. And so that's why we think we're going to -- we want to talk about it that way that we'll have profit growth in the back half. And really, what gives us that confidence is, foodservice continues its trajectory. Our international team continues to ramp up their performance. The retail team will continue to benefit. We've got, in addition to what Deanna talked about innovation, distribution, supply chain continues their strong performance. And then we haven't talked about it yet but we do expect to see our transformation and modernization initiative really accelerate as we go throughout the year. Tom Palmer : And then, I just wanted to ask on your visibility on whole Turkey. I think when we looked at last year, maybe you locked in or contracted a bit less volume pricing for whole birds than maybe in a normal year. So maybe an update there as you look at the progression of this year. Is it going to be a bit more normal in terms of whole bird contracted out and therefore, you have kind of a higher level of visibility on pricing than you did, say, a year ago? Jim Snee : Yeah. I think, it's we're in the midst of that process right now, Tom. So it's hard to say at this point. When we think about Turkey, there's a couple of components that we really should spend a little bit more time on; there's this the value-added business. And when we think about retail lean ground turkey, that value-added business is doing really well and gaining share. Our foodservice team, because we've got volumes back and supply back, they're doing a great job regaining lost business due to that lack of supply in the foodservice channel. And so really, what we're talking about is the decline in the market which obviously we are applying to what our estimates are in the whole bird turkey business for the rest of the year. And so that's how we're thinking about it to actually know how it's going to shake out from now through the end of the year is still TBD. Operator : Next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Ben Theurer : Congrats on this very strong results for first quarter. Jim, I wanted to kind of dig a little deeper into some of the volume dynamics and particularly in retail as it relates to the non-Turkey piece of it. And Deanna, maybe that actually a question also for you. As you look through the performance of the fourth -- the first quarter, sorry and you kind of progress further into 2Q and the back half of the year. What are your expectations for some of your other key categories in retail, in particular, as it relates to volume and the cadence of that, if you think about it on a sequential basis? Any color here would be much appreciated. Deanna Brady : Sure. Thanks, Ben. In the first quarter, we saw really nice volume growth across many of our flagship and rising brands. When you think about Bacon, you think about Pepperoni, you think about Applegate and our MegaMex portfolio, so nice volume both in shipments as well as takeaway at the shelf. Those are also a lot of the categories where we've invested capacity. And so we've got a good runway for growth when you think about Bacon and Pepperoni as examples. Planters had a particularly strong quarter as well as Skippy. And we continue -- we see those all those businesses I just mentioned continuing to grow throughout the year. And then, Jim mentioned Jennie-O Turkey on shelf is doing exceptionally well when you think of the value that turkey offers, the health benefits, we're working really hard to make sure that our consumers understand the value that turkey plays in their diet in particular and the health values there. And then, under our new go-forward structure, we're able to bring our brands together that really can be impactful to help consumers put dinner on the table. So you think of Jennie-O lean ground turkey, coupled with our protein Portfolio as we head into the next quarter with Cinco de Mayo and you'll see a lot of in-store activation of those brands working really hard together. Ben Theurer : Okay, perfect. And then, just one quick follow-up for Jacinth. On the bond that's due later in the year. Did you say you're going to plan on completely repaying it or partially repaying it? I didn't catch that in the prepared remarks. Sorry for that. I just wanted to clarify. Jacinth Smiley : So we will utilize our cash on a combination of our cash on hand and also going out to -- with new debt issuance to pay down the full $950 million. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : I want to ask as it relates to raw material input costs. We've seen various cuts within the overall cutout as well as the overall cutout come down, namely trim down considerably year-over-year, really for the last several quarters. Are you all in a position where you're able to start to recognize some margin benefit from that? And what is the lag associated with that dynamic and perhaps the tail in terms of your ability to procure and secure longer dated lower-priced raw materials? Jim Snee : Yes, Ben, as we think about the impact of raw materials in the quarter, I mean, it was largely in line with what we expected. And the thing that we've talked about often is it's not necessarily a point in time for a market. It's the volatility and how each of those cuts are reacting. So I think the biggest thing to know is that the commodity markets really didn't have a dramatic impact in our ability to have such a strong quarter this year or this first quarter. Ben Bienvenu : Okay, fair enough. As we think about supporting volume growth through the balance of the year, obviously, a good start to the year, do you find yourself needing to make or wanting to make targeted investments in promotional activity or vendor sponsor trade spend to support volume. What is your strategy there as we move through the year? Jim Snee : Yes. I'll go ahead and start on just the broader organization. I think we spend a lot of time on retail but I do think it's important to think about the total company volume growth. And international, again, had a really strong first quarter earlier than we expected but we expect them to show volume growth. Our foodservice business continues to be healthy that will be a strong contributor to the total company volume performance. But I'll let maybe Deanna address the retail question specifically. Deanna Brady : The plan for the rest of the year is a year-over-year increase in advertising. You'll see that advertising really pushed under our new structure towards the flagship and rising brands. That's working exceptionally well for us and we're seeing extremely strong return on investments. We have also moved to an always-on strategy, in particular, with Planters and that's working really hard as well. In addition to advertising to drive growth, we've got the most robust innovation pipeline and execution plan across a variety of our categories as we head into the year. And then, we finally are thinking about promotional activity as well and really monitoring how promotions are working and we are seeing a difference from how they've worked for the last few years as well as thinking about relative to pre-COVID time frames but really being intentional to ensure that we're getting the right promoted prices to help drive growth and keep consumers in our categories and with our brands. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Maybe just two really quick ones. Jacinth, thanks for the help on Jennie-O, the $0.15 update. I was wondering if we could just get a little bit more detail in terms of cadence. A, just what the impact was of that $0.15 in the first quarter and then I think you said the majority of it coming in 2Q, if you could put a finer point on that. Jacinth Smiley : So the way we are thinking about it for the rest of the year, certainly, it's going to impact all the rest of the quarters going through the year. But we're thinking about the most of that impact coming in the second quarter and then the rest spread out. So if we think about the additional $0.05 that we talked about, so coming into the year -- last year, we talked about $0.10 impact as we updated and looked at the impact this year, we think there's going to be an additional $0.05 and the additional $0.05 is going to be spread out with the most of that $0.05 coming in the second. Peter Galbo : Okay. But is it fair to assume like was there a very minimal impact in the first quarter? Or just, again, as we're trying to bridge the whole number? Jacinth Smiley : Yes. There is certainly some of it that happened in the first quarter, for sure, Peter. But it's a little bit minimal. Jim Snee : It's fair to say some of it will spill over into Q2. But in addition, we'll have the $0.05 to what Jacinth described as the majority of that $0.05 in Q2. Peter Galbo : Got it. And then, Jim, just foodservice, 1 question and maybe 1 comment. Obviously, quarter came in a lot better than a lot of the indicators would have said kind of back to Ken's question. Even to speaking about some of the headwinds from January. So just maybe wanted to unpack that more. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you said foodservice volume you'd expect kind of at similar level through the rest of the year. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that comment if it was just more of a positive volume trend on food service. Jim Snee : Yes. I mean, I think, the key takeaway here is the foodservice business continues to operate from a very advantaged position. And really strong Q1 and we expect that business to continue through -- continuous trajectory throughout the year which a big part of that is the volume growth that we expect in the back half of the business from it as well. So there was the January slowdown which really is just weather driven. We see the weather impacting the business and then, of course, some of the post-holiday doldrums. But the business continues to perform really well and we expect it to continue its trajectory in the back half of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Samuelson at Goldman Sachs. Adam Samuelson : So maybe just the first question, bit of a clarification. Just as I think about turkey and the impact on company level volumes, this quarter, you were lapping some of the steepest production disruptions last year from HPAI in your own business. And so just can you just articulate how much of the year-on-year volume growth at the company level, 3.7%, was attributable to kind of the normalization of your own turkey production, I would think it explains basically all of that 3.7%. And maybe touching on Peter's question, just to be clear, Jim, are you saying foodservice, you think, is growing volumes kind of mid- to high single-digit clip for the balance of the year? Or you're talking about the absolute volume tonnage staying at this level through the balance of the year. Jim Snee : Yes. Okay. So Adam, I guess on the Turkey question with volume, what we were saying is that we had expected Turkey volumes to grow which they did. But then, we also saw growth in underlying volumes in our broad-based value-added businesses. So that's how we're thinking about that. And then really for foodservice volume growth, we expect that to be in the mid-single-digit range. Adam Samuelson : Okay. Well, okay. So I guess maybe kind of keying off that then, especially where there's still inflation on the beef side. I'm trying to think about kind of mid-single-digit volumes in your foodservice business, kind of some recovery in International which had a quite challenging 2023. I'm trying to square that to the overall guidance for company level sales of up 1% to 3% for the year and just the implied decline in either consolidated pricing and/or the retail business in the balance of the year. So how do I bridge those 2 pieces a little bit more clearly? Jim Snee : Well, there's a lot there, Adam. I think from our perspective, I think, there's 2 things. I want to go back to the reason we reaffirmed our guidance is it's early. But I think the second part in terms of -- as you think about trying to parse all of that apart, I know you'll have a follow-up call with David and that's probably a really good time to walk through all those different parts. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Snee for closing comments. Jim Snee : Well, I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We're really pleased by our overall performance in the strong first quarter that we were able to deliver. This is a result of a total team effort and I want to take the opportunity to thank all of our teams. It's early. We know we have a lot of work to do to deliver the numbers we want to deliver for the balance of the year. But as I said earlier, we are executing our strategy and we have confidence that the business will keep moving in the right direction throughout 2024. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong first half of the year, with consecutive quarters of better-than-expected earnings, a significant improvement in operating cash flows, foodservice strength, recovery in our International business, and stable volumes across our business. Importantly, we made further progress on our strategic initiatives and we remain on track to deliver on our commitments to drive long-term shareholder returns and growth. We entered the year with a realistic and achievable path to improve our business over the next three years, and our first half performance demonstrates meaningful progress. We are driving savings, minimizing complexity, and reducing costs. As a result of this work, we delivered meaningful gross profit improvement in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. We are also capturing incremental value from our investments. The best example of this is the momentum our team has generated for the Planters Snack Nuts business, which is responding positively to our brand building and innovation efforts. Taken together, we are pleased to report first half adjusted diluted net earnings per share in line with last year. This represents improvement compared to our expectations heading into the year given the uncertain consumer environment and significant headwinds in our Turkey business. Core to our success so far this year is strong execution against our six strategic priorities, which include driving growth for each of our business segments; executing our enterprise entertaining & snacking vision and continuing to transform and modernize our company. We delivered an excellent first half within foodservice, growing volume, net sales, and segment profit mid-single digits respectively. The second quarter represented the fourth consecutive quarter our team achieved volume and segment profit growth and the foodservice team has now delivered year-over-year segment profit growth for nine out of the last 10 quarters. We continued to leverage our highly differentiated business model to provide innovative solutions to solve operator challenges. In the second quarter, we once again saw strong contributions from Bacon 1, our premium prepared proteins, pepperoni and Jennie-O Turkey. With the help of our culinary collective and direct salesforce, we continue to introduce innovative new offerings that are positioned to disrupt large foodservice categories. Two of our newest items, Hormel Flash 180 sous vide chicken and Hormel ribbon pepperoni have already exceeded our fiscal 2024 sales projections. And our new CAFE H Pork Al Pastor product also has been well received in the marketplace. We recently featured these products at the National Restaurant Association Show, where the response from customers was overwhelmingly positive. We believe our foodservice business is exceptionally well positioned to drive category growth, brand value, and operator engagement well into the future. Transitioning to our International segment, our performance has been very encouraging given the challenging conditions the team faced last year. From a profitability standpoint, International had a strong first half of the year with segment profit up almost 30%. Our team drove growth in many areas, including our partnerships in Indonesia and the Philippines, our refrigerated export business and in-country operations in China and Brazil. Notably in China, our foodservice business is performing relatively well, and our retail business continues to recover. We expect our retail business in China to improve in the back half of the year led by distribution gains of SPAM singles, the launch of new Skippy spreads and innovation in our shelf-stable meat snacking portfolio. Overall, we remain confident that we have the right strategy and structure in place to drive growth in our International business and develop our global presence over the long-term. In our Retail segment, we continue to navigate an environment characterized by an uncertain consumer backdrop and pressure from whole bird turkey dynamics. That said, there are many proof points showing that our focus on winning with consumers, winning with customers, and driving profitable growth is delivering positive returns. According to Circana, we gain share across several of our flagship brands during the second quarter, including Planters, Black Label, SPAM, and Jennie-O. Additionally, we increased total points of distribution by 6% for our flagship brands and 4% for our rising brands, which includes brands such as Applegate, Herdez, Corn Nuts, and Hormel Square Table. From a vertical perspective, we delivered strong results both in terms of shipments and consumer takeaway with bacon. Black Label raw and convenient bacon products are resonating with consumers and we expect this trend to continue in the back half of the year, supported by further advertising and innovation. Emerging brands, which contains our Applegate and Justin's brands, also delivered a strong quarter with mid single-digit volume and net sales growth compared to last year. Similarly, within snacking and entertaining, we delivered net sales growth for Planters snack nuts. I'll provide more detail on our successes within this important category later in my remarks. Within convenient meals and proteins, we are experiencing mixed results. Our SPAM family of products and Square Table entrees portfolios both delivered a strong first half even in response to pricing actions. But we did experience softer demand for other center store canned and convenient items. We are also seeing similar softness across the global flavors vertical and within the Mexican categories in which we compete. These trends are not entirely new, and our teams are actively working to address this in the back half of the year. Lastly, our value added meats vertical continues to be negatively impacted by Turkey dynamics. While we did drive growth during the first half across the Jennie-O value added retail portfolio, these gains were more than offset by weaker whole Turkey markets. We expect this business to remain challenged for the rest of the fiscal year. Our objective in retail is to balance volume and net sales gains to drive consistent profitable growth. We are managing through challenges such as Turkey pricing and pockets of software consumer demand. Longer term, the team remains focused on winning with our consumers and our customers, better allocating our resources and improving the margin structure of the business. Now moving on to our Enterprise-wide entertaining and snacking strategy where we continue to win by unlocking the value of our brands across the channels where we compete. Within retail, we saw some of the most positive in-market data for the Planters and Corn Nuts brands since our acquisition of the business, including volume, sales and share gains during the quarter for mixed nuts, cashews and Corn Nuts. This momentum is a direct result of expanded distribution and our investments in innovation, higher ROI advertising and brand building. Additionally, we released several new entertaining and snacking items, including Planters salt and vinegar cashews, Planters Nut Duos, loaded taco-flavored corn nuts, and summer-themed hard salami and pepperoni tray under the Hormel Gatherings brand, and we are supporting Hormel pepperoni, America's number one pepperoni brand. Our new national advertising campaign boldly irresistible highlights the versatility and craveability of this popular snack and is expected to help drive growth in the back half of the year. In foodservice, our team delivered excellent growth during the quarter in the convenience channel led by Planters flavored cashews and corn nuts innovation. And internationally, we recently announced that the Skippy brand is returning to the Canadian market in the form of five all new peanut butter inspired snack products. This compliments the work the team is doing to drive entertaining and snacking growth globally. Turning now to our last two strategic priorities, future fitting our one supply chain and advancing our transform and modernize initiative. In the second quarter, our supply chain efforts once again resulted in lower overall logistics expenses, lower distressed sales and higher investment income from responsible capital management. We also made further progress on our transform and modernize initiative in the areas of supply chain efficiency, portfolio optimization and data and analytics. Now within our planned work stream, we continued the implementation of a new end-to-end planning process and are integrating new planning technology. In the buy work stream, we are realizing the benefits from our new procurement and productivity programs. For the balance of the year, we are broadening our efforts outside the supply chain to all procurement areas. Within make, we completed a major improvement project to expand the capacity for our retail canned portfolio, allowing us to limit external production. Additionally, we launched a project to increase capacity for Bacon1. Both projects use existing assets and infrastructure and are expected to generate strong returns. In the move of work stream, we implemented analytics across our refrigerated network to further enhance our service levels. We are also exploring an expansion of our refrigerated network to drive added benefits and we continue to advance our total company portfolio optimization efforts. Leveraging our analytics tools and capabilities, we are finding opportunities to enhance and support margin profile improvements. We are eliminating lower margin SKUs, allowing us to maximize production time for more profitable items. Also, this quarter, we celebrated the opening of our new $5 million childcare center in Austin, Minnesota. Not only does this new facility assist the company's recruiting efforts in today's tight labor market, but more importantly, the center provides a needed service for our team members and our community. As transformational work is a key driver of our growth over the next several years and is essential for building significant and scalable capabilities for our future. Now shifting to our updated 2024 outlook. We are reaffirming our full-year topline outlook and updating our earnings outlook. We continue to expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%, assuming volume growth in key categories, a benefit from higher brand support and innovation, and our current assumptions for raw material input costs. In foodservice, we expect continued volume growth led by bacon, turkey, pizza toppings, and our line of premium prepared proteins. We expect net sales increases in our international business driven by branded exports and further recovery in China. In retail, we expect higher net sales for our bacon and emerging brands verticals. We have assumed net sales will be negatively impacted by volume and pricing headwinds in whole bird turkeys and higher elasticities in our center store business as previously discussed. From a bottom line perspective, we have increased the lower end of our diluted net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share ranges to reflect our solid first half performance and our expectations for growth from our foodservice and international segments, ongoing improvements across our supply chain and benefits from our transform and modernize initiative. Consistent with our prior guidance, our full-year outlook assumes higher salaries, normalized employee-related expenses and costs associated with planned investments in the business, including higher advertising investments. An additional factor expected to impact both our net sales and earnings guidance ranges is an unplanned production interruption at our Planters facility in Suffolk, Virginia. We discovered a food safety issue in April, which has since been resolved. Jacinth will provide more detail regarding the financial impact in her comments. Taking all these factors into account for the full-year, we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3%. Diluted net earnings per share of a $1.45 to a $1.55 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of a $1.55 to a $1.65 and benefits to net earnings from our transform and modernize initiative, which is expected to deliver its strongest level of savings in our fourth quarter. In closing, our first half performance demonstrates our team's ability to execute our clear and achievable plan. We have line of sight to a strong second half of the year as we make further progress on the initiative we laid out last fall. Our team remains focused on growing operating income, driving savings through our transform and modernize initiative, and capturing incremental value from our investments. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the second quarter and first half and additional color on our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted in his opening comments, we delivered a strong first half of the year. Volume for the first half was 2.2 billion pounds comparable to last year. Broad-based volume growth in foodservice and growth in international offset a decline in our Retail segment. Of the 29 million pound decline in retail, approximately two-thirds of the decline was related to lower sales across whole bird turkeys. Net sales for the second quarter and first half of the year were $2.9 billion and $5.9 billion respectively. Similar to volume there is some nuances in the numbers. The approximate negative impact in net sales for the first half of the year related to whole birds turkeys was 1% weighted more heavily against the second quarter. We increased gross profit by 3% in the second quarter and first half, driven by strength across the supply chain and benefits from our transform and modernize initiative. Gross profit margin improved 90 basis points to 17.4% in the second quarter. All segments delivered higher gross profit margins during the first half of the year. SG&A increased $54 million in the second quarter and $73 million during the first half of the year. These increases include the settlement of pork antitrust litigation, higher employee-related expenses, and higher external expenses, including $19 million related to incremental investments in our transform and modernize initiative. Advertising investments were up 27% in the second quarter and up 9% for the first half. We continue to support our leading brands in the marketplace with new advertising creatives and stepped up spending for the balance of the year, including for the SPAM, Hormel pepperoni, Planters and Black Label brands. Equity in earnings for the second quarter and first half decreased due to low results from MegaMex, partially offset by improvement from our international partnerships. Interest and investment income for the second quarter and first half increased as interest income from higher cash balances and favorable market interest rates offset higher interest expense associated with the recent debt issuance. Earnings before income taxes were $244 million for the second quarter and $530 million for the first half. On an adjusted basis, earnings before income taxes for the first half were $564 million, a 1% increase compared to the first half of last year. The effective tax rate was 22.5% for the second quarter and 23% for the first half, which were higher than last year. Our prior year effective tax rate benefited from higher federal deductions. Given the higher rate to date, the effective tax rate for the fiscal 2024 year is now expected to be between 22% and 23%. The net result of all these factors was second quarter and first half diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 and $0.74, respectively. First half adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.79 in line with last year. We also delivered strong operating cash flow during the first half of the year. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $640 million, an increase of 55%. We remain committed to dividend growth investing in our business and maintaining an investment grade rating. We paid our 383rd consecutive quarterly dividend effective May 15th at an annual rate of $1.13 per share. We also announced our August dividend, which will represent our 96th year of uninterrupted dividends. We invested $60 million in capital projects during the second quarter. The largest capital projects for the quarter included the packaging projects for Planters and investment in our new order to cash system. Our outlook for capital expenditures in 2024 remains at $280 million. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and short-term securities and $3.8 billion of debt. During the quarter, we completed a debt offering of $500 million. We plan to use the proceeds of the issuance and the cash on hand to pay off the $950 million note that is due in June of this year. As Jim shared, we are reaffirming our full-year net sales expectations and updating our earnings expectations. We expect third quarter pork input costs to increase seasonally and are seeing this pattern play out for key inputs such as bellies, trim and hogs. We continue to assume full-year pork input costs to be higher than last year and above five-year averages. In Turkey, supply disruption this spring from HPAI was minimal and we remain in a strong position to service our customers and attract new business opportunities. We are projecting growth across several parts of our genuine branded Turkey business, including lean ground turkey in retail, and value-added turkey in foodservice. Lower volumes and pricing for commodity whole turkeys are expected to continue to pressure earnings. As Jim noted, we experienced an unplanned production interruption at our Planters facility in Suffolk, Virginia. This issue is expected to affect service levels on some of our highest volume and innovative items, primarily impacting the third quarter. We have included in our updated earnings outlook an estimated $0.03 impact related to this issue. In terms of our back half cadence, we expect third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be lower compared to last year and the second quarter. The primary drivers are continued whole turkey headwinds and the Suffolk production interruption. We expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter, anticipating growth from all business segments and the strongest contribution of the year from our transform and modernize initiative. To conclude my remarks, I would like to thank the entire team for their contributions to a solid first half of the year, and for their continued commitment. There is more work ahead and we are confident that we have the right strategy, people and balanced portfolio to drive the business forward and deliver long-term sustainable value. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please ask your question. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Good morning and thank you. Jim Snee : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Goldman : I wanted to ask about the EPS guide range, $0.02 increase roughly at the midpoint. Your first half EPS alone came in $0.08 or $0.09 above consensus. You mentioned that the Virginia plant interruption is expected to affect earnings by about $0.03 or so, still is a little bit of a gap between how much the first half beat, and I think it beat your own expectations as you said and kind of what you're looking for from the back half in terms of guidance. So just wanting to get a little bit of idea of if there's any prudence that you might call out in your guidance or just kind of how you're thinking about some of the puts and takes in the back half of the year from a bottom line perspective that might be holding back your guidance range from what it otherwise could have been? Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning, Ken. Thanks for the question. As we sit here today, yes, we're ahead of expectations. We feel good about the business. And as you commented, you saw this morning, we took up the low-end of our adjusted EPS range, increased the midpoint. We also delivered stronger margins for the second quarter and first half, which really demonstrates the progress we're making on, on key initiatives. And if it wasn't for the Suffolk issue that we talked about in our prepared remarks, we would be having a more positive conversation today. A couple of the more specific items to think about, we mentioned Planters and Suffolk. We would also think about \u2013 on our first quarter call, we talked about the incremental impact of the full-year Turkey, which was roughly $0.05. And then also, we talked about the tax rate as well that'll have an impact of $0.01 to $0.02. So when you take all those things together, we feel like the raise is \u2013 the increase in the raise is appropriate. When we think about what's really positive, we're going to still expect strong performance from foodservice and international. We've got a path to growth in retail. We still expect our strongest transform and modernize delivery in the back half of the year. But clearly, we got some things that we're watching, talking about the Planters business. And then also really keeping a close eye on what's happening with the Turkey market overall. But when you boil it all down to the bottom line, we're really pleased with our half one performance and a clear line of sight to growth in the back half of the year. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, guidance for topline growth was reiterated of course for the year. It does imply a pretty decent step up in the back half rate despite comparisons that are slightly more difficult. You talked about better innovation, more advertising; you talked about your current assumptions for raw material inputs. Can you elaborate a little bit though on kind of what the key drivers will be to maybe accelerate that topline in the back half of the year? Just how do we think about bucketing the most important of those drivers, especially in retail where you said the whole bird turkey business will remain challenged? Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Thanks, Ken for the follow-up. I think there's \u2013 one of the things I would say is, let's take foodservice and international maybe off the table. Foodservice has got broad-based strength outperforming the industry, really expect that momentum to continue for the balance of the year. The international business, we expect to have strong sales growth in the back half of the year as well. So I think those two businesses are going to provide strong growth and really the story is in retail. And so as we said, it is a bit of a mixed bag. We've got a lot of verticals that are doing just fine. You talk about Turkey, and the impact that that'll have in the back half of the year. And then we also said in our prepared remarks, just watching what happens in the convenient meals and protein vertical. And so we have had bright spots with SPAM, refrigerated entrees, Skippy, but we've got some other brands and categories that we're watching. We do have really strong syndicated data over the last four weeks, which is really, really encouraging. And so there's a lot of good news and we do expect to be able to deliver in that range. What I would say is as we think about it, the most likely scenario would be towards the low end of that net range or the low end of the range for the net sales guide. Kenneth Goldman : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please ask your question. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the color actually on the quarter and go forward. Maybe just for my first question, a little bit of a two-parter. Jacinth, I just wanted to clarify. I think you said that Turkey accounted for two-thirds of the volume decline in U.S. retail. I wasn't sure if that was a first half or a 2Q comment specifically. And then Jim, maybe if you can just elaborate a bit more on the convenient meals and protein side, I mean, obviously we've now gone through kind of lapping the lower snap benefits that would seem to be kind of a category that, that maybe would be a bit more exposed to that. Just what's the playbook from here to kind of try and improve the volume forward as kind of that perceived tailwind is maybe not as much of a tailwind as we would've thought? I think that's probably a broader question across food. But we'd love your thoughts there. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Peter. Yes, indeed. So the volume impact for the first half is related to \u2013 two-thirds of that is related to Turkey. And then Deanna will take the next part of your question. Deanna Brady : Yes. Thanks, Peter. Relative to convenient meals and protein, I think it's important to kind of tease apart. There was strong growth in SPAM and entrees as well as Skippy, which we bucket under convenient meals and protein where we're really seeing the softer demand and the consumer pullback is in the canned or center store area. When we think about the quarter and some of the impacts, as you mentioned, it really was related to Snap, weather being softer. Historically, that's a quarter that has colder weather and influences the purchase of those types of products. And competition in promotions have heated up in those categories. So as we think about it heading into Q3, that is seasonally a lower quarter for convenient meals of protein. But that doesn't mean our team isn't hard at work attacking some of the opportunities that they're thinking about is, making sure our promotions are in place, making sure our promotions are driving depth, pulling up on frequency to make sure we're getting to those promoted price points that are going to encourage purchase. We're also working close with our retailers on displays and getting product out of center store and out into the other areas where we disrupt people on their path to purchase. We're also shifting some dollars into the category to be speaking with consumers about the value that these items play especially as consumers are thinking about value options as they're shopping. And then I think the final piece is thinking about as we head into the fall, making sure that we already have really significant promotions in place for a heavy holiday season, back-to-school what have you. Peter Galbo : Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks, Deanna. And then Jim, maybe just to follow-up on Ken's question around kind of the back half sales guidance and understanding the kind of the low-end of the range is helpful. Any thoughts just as we model out the back half kind of volume relative to price mix, how we should think about that I think given what you've said about some of the raw materials and maybe the pass-through nature? Just want to understand some of those components in the back half. Thanks very much. Jim Snee : Yes. Sure. And we can do that for you, Peter. As just as we go through the segments, foodservice, we expect volume mid single-digits, sales in the high single-digit range. International will be a bit more nuanced where volume will probably be down high-single digits. And a lot of that is lower fresh pork, some of the commodity businesses. But sales, because the mix improves, will be up high-single digits. And then the Retail business, we do expect volume and sales to be in that mid single-digit range down. I'm sorry, low single-digit range down. And then all of that, there's still that path to get us into that guided range, but we do think the most likely scenario would be to be at the low end of the range. Peter Galbo : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, Jim. Jim Snee : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please ask your question. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So just on the advertising front so, we know there's an increase this quarter in advertising. Just curious how the returns are applying out thus far versus your expectations? Deanna Brady : Yes. Thanks, Rupesh. This is Deanna. As we introduced back at Investor Day, we talked about our flagship and our rising brands and resourcing those brands to drive higher growth rates. When you think about the performance of SPAM, Black Label Bacon, Jennie-O and where we're spending our advertising, we're seeing really strong performance in both volume and market share gains. In addition to the advertising, we're also introducing innovation in all of those categories. And so it's really a one-two punch of not only reminding the consumers about the products, but when they get to shelf that they're seeing some innovation there as well. So we're excited about the advertising. We've also introduced a lot of new advertising with new brand positioning, backing it up and happy to as we think about the quarter coming up pepperoni goes \u2013 is already in market with new packaging as well as new advertising. And we're really excited about what that's going to continue to do as one of our other flagship brands. So working well for strong returns and continuing to get stronger and stronger as we progress. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up question. As you look at your Retail segment, how would you describe the current promotional competitive backdrop? I know some of the retailers out there are talking about reducing prices, so just to want to get a sense of how you guys would characterize the backdrop right now? Deanna Brady : So it depends by category. I think in most categories, we're comfortable. And for us we're really thinking about the desired outcome and is our promotional dollars really driving returns for us. And in some cases, under the new structure that we have, we're able to shift dollars from trade into advertising or into other areas to support growth if it's not providing the right return. We're also though then shifting dollars, like I said, on convenient meals and protein into convenient meals and protein to help support the right promoted price points that we need in this particular a lower seasonality for us in convenient meals and proteins. That category in particular seeing more competition, but across the board, we're not seeing anything that's out of the ordinary. Relative to our customers, they get to control price at shelf. We can influence and we can have conversations, we can make sure they understand based on our insights and analytics, what is going to drive growth and profitability and we can inform as a category leader and a category supporter. That's our role. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please ask your question. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Just looking at the retail scanner data and how it compared to your reported figures. There was a little bigger gap than we had expected. And I guess first was curious how much SKU rationalizations might be a factor there? Or you've touched on the Turkey weakness, is that maybe a more unmeasured piece of the business relative to others? And just how we should think about that, how that might look over the rest of the year \u2013 how the gap might look, but how they would compare? Jim Snee : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the question, Michael. I think, as you've talked about, really positive trends in our scanner data with five of the six verticals showing growth. And really the decline is in turkeys and in some of the non-tracked areas of the business. We still do have some contract manufacturing business that is showing declines in addition to the Turkey that we discussed. But those are really the drivers for the volume decline. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. That's helpful. And when you talk about the pressure in the center store on at least certain categories, can you point to maybe any common thread, the brands where there's weakness ones that face more private label exposure? Do they have higher price gaps? Is it higher absolute price points? Is there any sort of consumer read there that you can get from what you are seeing in the center store part of the business that you called out? Deanna Brady : Yes. Thank you. There's going to be a couple of things. One, there's a lot more competition in those categories. We're also seeing the price elasticities play out based on the price increases we took in Q2, based on beef markets as a strong component in the majority of those items. So the price elasticities was something that we anticipated and expected. The competition obviously, and the heavier promotional activity is something that we're working to counteract as we speak. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Good morning. So I guess I want to maybe dig in on the retail side. And Jim, I appreciate the clarity you gave around the sales and volume expectation for the Retail segment. In the second half of the year, I know there were some parts of the business where there was targeted price increases that you were putting in place for the end of the second quarter. I just want to maybe hone in on those because they do seem to be touching on some of the categories having more weakness right now. And are you seeing the elasticities proving to be higher than you thought going in? Are you seeing pushback from retailers on just not taking the price increases? Or help me think about how that has \u2013 or how that successful those actions are relative to the plans you might have had three or six months ago? Jim Snee : Yes. I think, Adam, I'll start with kind of the pricing with retailers and clearly there's heightened level of discussions in terms of pricing and that's not anything new. We've talked about that in the past. And the retail team does a really nice job making sure that there's solid rationale and clarification on why the pricing was needed. The other part of this is, the team is working to address those issues now, and there's \u2013 it's a combination of short-term and also really the long-term vision of where we see some of these things playing out. And I'll let Deanna add some additional color on that. Deanna Brady : Yes. So when I think back to Planters as an example a year ago where we took a really thorough approach to thinking about what short-term actions do we need to take to address in the quarter maybe in the half. But longer term, we were also doing work and similar work that we're doing against the convenient meals and protein. When we think about our revenue growth management team and price pack architecture and really evaluating our price points, evaluating our promotional productivity, again, as I mentioned, shifting some of our promotions to a more productive strategy perhaps. We're also thinking about innovation. We mentioned some of our flagship brands that perform so well in the first half and that we expect to continue to perform well. And the drivers of the performance were really three things. It was advertising and refreshed advertising in many cases based on brand positioning work that was done. Is based on innovation and so when we got consumers to the shelf, they were also excited to try new flavors, new pack sizes, new shapes, forms, what have you. So we're also thinking about innovation and advertising. And really some really great work that drove a lot of progress in the first half was our retail selling organization and the total points of distribution that they've been able to gain in both our flagship and our rising brands in the 5% range of increase. And so we expect that important work to do, which comes through sitting down with your category managers and usually can be six months to a year out as those we sell a new total distribution points. So it's going to be a very thorough approach that we again, execute in the short-term through promos, displays, turning on social media as well as long-term through PPA innovation, advertising and gaining distribution. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful color. And then just taking a step back on the SG&A side, this quarter, obviously there's a bigger year-on-year increase in employee incentive payments on top of the advertising that you kind of more clearly break out. As we think about the full-year, what's the right range of non-advertising-related SG&A growth that we should be thinking about? And presumably that growth would moderate next year because you're not going to have the year-on-year expansion or the same magnitude of year-on-year expansion and employee compensation as you are this year. But just helps us frame that, that trajectory going into through the end of the second half and next year. Thanks. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. Hi. Good morning. So the perspective that we're thinking about you should have relative to SG&A is certainly the biggest component year-over-year is going to be the expenses-related to our transform and modernize. And so that will drive a double-digit increase year-over-year in the back half of this year, but also going into next year as well in addition to the fact that we do have that higher compensation that we outlined in our prepared remarks. Adam Samuelson : That's helpful color. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Tom Palmer from Citi. Please ask your question. Tom Palmer : Good morning. Thank you. You noted lower whole Turkey volumes, especially at retail. How does this align with your Turkey production? Are you pulling back that as well? Or is this more reference to kind of what you're selling to customers? Because if you're not cutting supply by as much, I guess, where is the Turkey essentially going and is there a point where maybe volumes inflect a bit more. Jim Snee : Yes. Tom, good morning. I think the biggest takeaway in Turkey from where we sit today is there really is no change in our outlook. We've got strong internal supply and capacity. The teams are doing a great job both at retail and foodservice. We're gaining share with our lean ground turkey. Our foodservice team, as we've talked about, they've been hard at work regaining some of the lost business that we had during the AI event. And so there's really, really no change to how we're thinking about the business for the rest of the year. Really, we think that we've de-risked the Turkey outlook for the rest of the year. Tom Palmer : Thank you. Just on the foodservice side. At an industry level, we've seen a pullback in traffic, it seems like you're really not seeing the effects of this and at least the guidance you gave would appear that you don't really expect a whole lot of pressure in the second half of the year either. Could you just give any detail on what's really driving this growth in terms of \u2013 are you seeing your customers not seeing the traffic pressure just given maybe a different mix than the broader industry? Are there new customer wins to be thinking about? Just any detail there. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. Thanks, Tom. Obviously the foodservice team had another excellent start to the year and it remains well positioned for the balance of the year. And so just as a reminder, we compete both in the commercial and non-commercial elements of the business. And so we've really got a broad array of customer base. When we think about who we're targeting and who we're selling to, we talked about the great work happening in the convenience channel, not only with our Planters business, but also thinking about some of the grab and go opportunities for us where we're more of an ingredient. And so it's those things, thinking about the channel diversification, we've talked at length about the competitive advantage. We think our direct salesforce offers us being front and center with the customer, talking to them about their challenges, what's happening in their business. And then last but certainly not least is just this continued innovation pipeline that the team has been able to build. We've again talked for many years about Bacon 1 and how that business continues to grow. This quarter we're talking about our Flash 180 sous vide fully cooked chicken item that we're bringing to operators to help them have high quality chicken items on their menu when maybe they don't have the right equipment or staff to do it. So there's a lot of things at play that, again, we believe puts us in a very advantaged position and helps us especially in the face of some of the data that you're seeing, our team is still out there able to drive results. Tom Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Ben Theurer from Barclays. Please ask your question. Benjamin Theurer : Yes. Good morning. Jim, Jacinth, thanks for taking my question. Obviously, lot's been asked already. Just wanted to follow-up first on some of your expectations on the international business. Clearly, it was good on the profit side, but topline was down. Did I hear this right that you said, like volume down high single-digit, but sales actually up high single-digit, just wanted to clarify that commentary and to understand a little bit if you can share with us a regional nuance as to the performance in international? That would be my first question. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes. So Ben, you did hear that correctly, in terms of volume being down high-single digits and sales being up high-single digits. And a big part of that is mix. When we think about some of the lower commodity sales that we'll have, and we'll have a lot more branded business going through that segment. As we think about China, the retail business is continuing to improve. It's not where it has been in the past, but there's a lot of great work happening in terms of regaining distribution, innovation in our shelf stable meat snacking portfolio. But the foodservice business is really, really strong and continues to gain momentum in China. We've been pleased with the results of the investments that we've made in Indonesia. Our partners in the Philippines continue to have a strong performance. So again, it really is as we've said that going into the year and even in Q1 is that the business has continued to improve throughout the year as we expected. We do expect some acceleration in half too. And I would remind you again, that when we think about especially Q4 international is lapping a pretty weak Q4 comp that's something else to think about. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then my follow-up, if I may, just real quick around the volume performance in retail. And you gave already a lot of detail, but just wanted to understand like, what is your approach in terms of thinking to recover these \u2013 this lost volume? Is there any way of considering certain isolated [indiscernible] pricing more temporary through promotion and trying to stimulate the volume? So what is your kind of playbook to get the volumes going again particularly in retail? Jim Snee : Yes. And I think the one thing I don't want to have lost in this conversation is that there are some brands in that, that vertical that are doing really well. We talked about SPAM, our refrigerated entrees, Skippy, peanut butter. And so there is some really strong performance there. I think Deanna has talked, and I'll maybe let her reiterate the fact that the team is thinking about this in two buckets. There's the short-term work that we can do, and then really the long-term opportunities for the team. And that's really where we want to spend our time to make sure that we've got the parts of the businesses that need the support that we have them on the solid ground. So Deanna, just maybe reiterate some of that. Deanna Brady : Yes. Beyond what I've already said about our flagship brands, which had a nice volume growth supported by advertising innovation in the first half. We'll continue to see that support as we head into the back half. The other areas that you'll see is continued innovation, and we've got numerous innovation launches. I believe they were in the pre-read deck that were launched in the first half and are launching in the second half. What we're really happy to see with the innovation is that we're bringing in new consumers. So think about the new [indiscernible] entrees and the House of Tsang entrees, bringing in multicultural and younger consumers into the portfolio. Seeing the same thing with the Planters innovation, both the flavored cashews and the duos. So we'll continue to drive new consumers. Obviously those things support not only our baseline business, but incremental business as well. You can see us continue to advertise throughout the back half of the year. And then finally, from a promotional standpoint, we've got a lot of promotional activity already secured through Q3 working on Q4 right now as our teams lock up back-to-school and think about holiday programming. So those are some of the key things the team will be executing both in the short-term as well as continuing to think about the long-term. The one that I don't want to forget to talk about because it's really important work is the price pack architecture work through our revenue growth management team and the data and the insights that we're bringing to the table to really think about overall category growth based on having the right prices on shelf, having the right promotions in place, as well as the right assortment. And that work does take some time to not only do the studies, but also to then get out and execute with customers and then get that new set and new sizing and new pricing and promotions on shelf. Benjamin Theurer : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please ask your question. Heather Jones : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jim Snee : Hi, Heather. Heather Jones : Hi. My first question is, it's a really quick two-part detail. One was wondering what the Turkey impact in Q2 was on volume and on the Suffolk impact for Q3 even assuming a really high contribution margin, it seems like that $0.03 would translate into about a 3%, maybe 4% impact to retail sales for Q3. So I just wanted to check my math on that? Jim Snee : Yes. So Heather, I'll start with the Turkey volume. We've been talking about it in the first half. David can get you the specific Q2 number in your follow-up call. And then your estimate in terms of the range for impact in Planter and Suffolk, that's probably pretty close. Heather Jones : Okay. And so then I just wanted to step back and just make sure I'm understanding the big picture clearly. So relative to when you gave guidance at the beginning of the year. In Q2, I think, if I remember correctly, increased the negative impact from Turkey by about a nickel and then now we've got this $0.01 to $0.02 impact from taxes and then a $0.03 impact from Suffolk. So that's a pretty large number relative to your initial guidance. And so what have been the primary drivers of that the \u2013 much greater strength than the other \u2013 in the other components of your earnings? Jim Snee : Yes. Heather, we've seen really strong performance from our foodservice business and our international business has rebounded in a really strong way. The other part that we do want to mention when we bring into this conversation is, is the work that we've been doing and transform and modernize. And so we've talked about that at our Investor Day, we will have the opportunity here at the end of the year to provide some additional clarity. But I think that's a piece of the work that the team is doing. And we again, had that in our prepared remarks. The work that we're doing to plan the business, how we buy for the business, how we make it, how we move it, all of those things have been really, really effective for us. And so that would really be the third driver in our ability to overcome to what you described as our pretty, pretty good headwinds. But the bottom line is that, we're ahead of expectations. We feel good about the business, pleased with half one and a clear line of sight for half two growth. Heather Jones : Okay. Thank you so much. Jim Snee : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand the call back to Jim Snee, CEO for the closing remarks. Jim Snee : Yes. So I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We're really pleased by our overall performance and the strong first half of the year we were able to deliver. This is a result of a total team effort, and I want to take the opportunity to thank all of our teams. We have made a lot of progress on our initiatives, but we still have a lot of work to do. But as I said earlier, we have confidence and our business will keep moving in the right direction for the balance of fiscal 2024. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now ended. Thank you all for joining. You may all disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. We delivered solid third quarter results and another quarter of better than expected earnings. Our core business remains healthy, led by retail takeaway growth, top line growth in our Foodservice business, further recovery in our International business and continued progress on our transform and modernize initiative. Specifically, many of our key retail brands grew during the quarter, outperforming their categories and continuing to resonate with our customers and consumers. Our Foodservice business delivered another quarter of above industry sales growth, highlighting the value of our solutions based portfolio, direct selling team, and diverse customer and operator base. We continued to experience significant recovery in our International segment in the quarter, led by our global brands and we continue to realize growing benefits from our transform and modernize initiative. We remain on a realistic and achievable path to improve our business, deliver on our commitments and execute against our long-term strategic priorities. Going a bit deeper into our performance for the quarter, I'll start with our Foodservice segment. Our Foodservice team delivered another quarter of above industry growth, marking our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth. We grew volume and net sales despite pockets of industry softness, proving the effectiveness of our differentiated value proposition. As expected, Foodservice segment profit was generally in-line with last year. Foodservice segment profit remains historically strong and healthy, having grown nine out of the last 11 quarters. Our balanced approach, including our portfolio, direct selling team and the diverse channels we operate in, continue to protect our Foodservice segment from many macro headwinds. We continue to see strong demand for our premium and solutions based items, including premium bacon and pepperoni, premium prepared proteins and turkey. Products such as Bacon 1 cooked Bacon, Fire Braised meats, Jennie-O turkey, Cafe H globally inspired proteins and Old Smokehouse bacon, each delivered double-digit net sales gains. Additionally, innovative offerings such as Hormel Flash 180 sous vide style chicken breast and Hormel ribbon pepperoni contributed growth during the quarter. Our direct selling organization remains key in times of industry slowdown. Our team can connect directly with operators to strategically find solutions for their challenges, take costs out of their system and create meaningful long lasting relationships. We were once again named to Selling Power's 60 Best Companies to Sell For, recognizing the direct sales teams that support each of our segments. And we believe that our diverse channel presence in foodservice enables resilience in the face of industry pressures. We have continued to deliver steady top line growth in both our commercial and non-commercial businesses. Taken together, our Foodservice business continues to be exceptionally well positioned to drive innovation, value, and operator engagement. Transitioning to our International segment. Our performance in the quarter shows continued improvement versus the challenging environment we experienced last year. From a profitability standpoint, the business generated impressive segment profit growth of 78% compared to prior year. Our results in the quarter were driven primarily by a greatly improved export environment. Branded exports performed well in the third quarter with SPAM luncheon meat delivering a second consecutive quarter of double-digit top line growth. Skippy peanut butter also had a strong quarter as we expanded distribution in the South Korean market. In addition, our branded refrigerated exports continued to perform well in global foodservice channels. Commodity exports, which have historically benefited the International segment's top line, but delivered lower profitability than other elements of the portfolio were down significantly year-over-year. This is a result of improved inventory management and stronger sales of value added turkey items in the domestic U.S. market this year. Our China business continued to rebound in the quarter and is off to a strong start for the fourth quarter. An important part of China's improvement is our strategy within the retail space. We saw positive results from innovation launches with our largest retail customers in the quarter, a direct result of our in country innovation center. Finally, we are realizing strong results from our investments in the Philippines and Indonesia, delivering on our commitment to strategically expand our global presence and restore sustainable growth in our International business. Overall, we remain confident that we have the right strategy and structure in place to drive growth in our International business over the long-term. Shifting now to retail, where our third quarter results are a bit nuanced on the top line. So, I'll spend some time explaining them. First, and most importantly, there is strength in the underlying core business, we were pleased with the end market performance of key brands in the quarter. According to Circana, brands such as Hormel Black Label bacon, Jennie-O lean ground turkey, SPAM luncheon meat, Skippy peanut butter, Hormel Chili, Mary Kitchen hash, Lloyd's barbecue, Applegate natural and organic meats, and Wholly Guacamole grew dollar sales in the third quarter. Additionally, we are outperforming in many of our categories. Our performance in key categories such as bacon, canned meats, turkey and peanut butter demonstrates that our investments in key brands are working. We are also optimistic about the trend line we are seeing in our convenient meals and proteins business, which has stabilized over the last quarter. We continue to support the center store with innovation, including SPAM Korean barbecue during the third quarter, which is the 12th permanent variety in the SPAM family of products. This product is garnering a lot of excitement because the flavor profile is on trend and reaching new SPAM consumers. Second, business momentum continues in our important bacon and emerging brands verticals. The bacon vertical again delivered strong results, both in terms of shipments and consumer takeaway. Black Label raw and convenient bacon products are resonating with consumers and showed growth in dollar sales, volume and household penetration during the quarter. According to Circana, Black Label bacon is the leading growth brand in the bacon category over the last 12 months. We expect these trends to continue into Q4 as we support our bacon brands through advertising investments and introduced exciting new innovations to the marketplace, such as oven-ready bacon and Black Label cinnamon toast crunch bacon. Within the emerging brands vertical, Applegate items grew across all major categories in the quarter, including bacon, breakfast sausage, hot dogs, deli meats and breaded chicken. We also launched Applegate organic pepperoni, the first and only nationally available organic pepperoni. We are excited to see the results and development for this emerging category. Growth from our key brands, our overall category performance and our innovative launches show the strength and health of our underlying core retail business. However, as we discussed during our second quarter earnings call, overall top line results in our retail segment remain nuanced. We continue to be negatively impacted by turkey dynamics. The growth in branded Jennie-O items is being more than offset by whole bird commodity markets. Our expectations for the year have largely unfolded as discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Next, as we mentioned on our second quarter earnings call, we experienced a production disruption at our Planters facility in Suffolk, Virginia, which was impactful to the third quarter. Production is back up and running as we have taken corrective action within the facility. As production continues to ramp-up, we have secured co-packer partnerships to help support our snack nuts portfolio to improve fill rates while we finish upgrades within the Suffolk plant. By the end of this fiscal year, we believe the production disruption will be largely resolved and we will be in a much better position to return the business to full service levels. Jacinth will provide more color on the financial impacts during her commentary. I want to thank our broader team for the work they have done to help control the disruption, service the business and protect the Planters brands. Lastly, we continue to see softness in our high volume, low margin contract manufacturing business. We expect continued top line headwinds in this business due to lower demand for some items. So to wrap up our retail discussion, the underlying core business is healthy. We remain focused on working with our retail customers to drive category growth and create meaningful value for our end consumers. Moving now to our enterprise wide strategic initiatives. We are seeing a growing benefit from our transform and modernize initiative. All of our pillars, plan, buy, make, move and portfolio optimization, progressed in the third quarter and the work streams continue to mature. This quarter, we are highlighting two pillars, Plan and Make. For Plan, significant work was done during the quarter on the implementation of our new end-to-end planning process and technology. While this upgrade will have many benefits for years to come, we are quickly generating new insights, which have helped in our focus on improved inventory management. For the Make pillar, our operational improvements have generated encouraging results. We continue to unlock additional production capacity and realize cost savings across our network. These wins, as well as our ongoing focus on continuous improvement across all our facilities are resulting in impactful advancements across our vast supply chain. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we look forward to providing you with a comprehensive update on our transform and modernize initiatives, including recaps from 2024 and our plans for 2025 and beyond. Shifting now to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We are updating our net sales guidance to account for commodity market conditions, impacts from the production disruption at our Suffolk facility and continued softness in our contract manufacturing business within the retail segment. We are also narrowing our earnings guidance range as we approach the fourth quarter. This update includes an incremental impact from the production disruption at our Suffolk facility. In our Retail segment, we expect continued momentum across our key brands and categories led by bacon, value added turkey, and emerging brands. We are also committed to supporting our brands through strategic trade and advertising investments for the remainder of the year. We are expecting successful execution of our fourth quarter innovations and improvements to our Planter service levels. In Foodservice, we expect continued broad based volume and net sales growth led by bacon, turkey, pizza toppings, and our line of premium prepared proteins. We expect another quarter of significant segment profit growth in the International segment. And importantly, we expect continued benefits to net earnings from our transform and modernize initiative, which is expected to deliver its strongest level of savings in our fourth quarter. Taking all these factors into account for the full year, we expect net sales in the range of $11.8 billion to $12.1 billion and diluted net earnings per share in the range of $1.45 to $1.51, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.57 to $1.63. We continue to demonstrate our ability to execute our clear and achievable plan and are on track to deliver on our earnings commitments for the year. In closing, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Deanna Brady, Executive Vice President of Retail, leader, mentor, advocate, and a friend. Last month, we announced Deanna's decision to retire after almost three decades of service to Hormel Foods. Deanna has impacted almost every area of our company. Her leadership during COVID and the go-forward reorganization was critical to our success, and the culture of accountability she has created will last for years. I wish her the best in her well-deserved retirement. Deanna's ambition, passion for our business, and leadership will be greatly missed. We also announced the return of John Ghingo to Hormel Foods. Enabled by our intentional and well developed succession process, we are fortunate to welcome John back to the organization to lead the Retail Group. John is a dynamic leader, known for building strong teams and strong brands. He is the ideal person to drive continued focus, innovation and growth within the retail segment and our company. John's deep expertise in the consumer packaged goods space, coupled with his understanding of our business positions him perfectly for success. At this time, I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to the third quarter and additional color on our outlook. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. As Jim noted in his opening comments, we delivered another quarter of solid results and better than expected earnings. Volume for the third quarter was 1 billion pounds and net sales were $2.9 billion. Top line growth in Foodservice was more than offset by declines in our international and retail segments. To provide more color on our Retail segment's top line results, approximately three quarters of the net sales declines were related to lower sales of whole bird turkeys, contract manufacturing and Planters. Gross margin was comparable to the prior year period at 16.8% the benefits of our transform and modernize initiative offset headwinds from lower commodity turkey pricing and lower sales of Planters snack nuts. SG&A decreased $31 million in the third quarter due to the lapping of our unfavorable arbitration ruling in the prior year. Adjusted SG&A increased 4%, driven primarily by planned higher employee related expenses. We continue to support our leading brands in the marketplace and expect to increase advertising expenses for the fourth quarter and full year, including an advertising campaign to support our new Planters Nut Duos. Equity and earnings for the third quarter decreased due to lower results from our MegaMex joint venture, partially offset by improvement from our international investments. MegaMex was impacted by higher avocado costs, partially resulting from the temporary suspension of USDA inspections during the quarter. Interest and investment income from the third quarter increased as interest income from favorable market rates offset higher interest expense associated with the recent debt issuance. Earnings before income taxes were $226 million, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, earnings before income taxes for the third quarter were $256 million. The effective tax rate was 21.7% for the third quarter, in-line with last year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 to be between 22% and 23%. Our third quarter performance resulted in diluted net earnings per share of $0.32. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.37, we have delivered strong operating cash flow during the year. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $858 million, an increase of 18%. We remain committed to dividend growth, investing in our business, and maintaining an investment grade credit rating. We paid our 384th consecutive quarterly dividend effective August 15, at an annual rate of $1.13 per share. This dividend marks the 96th year of uninterrupted dividends returned to our shareholders. We invested $65 million in capital projects during the third quarter. Our outlook for capital expenditures in 2024 remains at $280 million. During the quarter, we used a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issued in the second quarter to pay-off a $950 million note that came due. With this debt repayment, we remain comfortably within our stated long-term leverage ratio range. Shifting to our outlook. We're updating the full year net sales range and narrowing our earnings expectations. Our revised top line range encompasses the current projection for the business, including declines due to : One, updated commodity market expectation as third quarter pork costs did not rise to the level as expected; Two, the impact of the Suffolk disruption; And three, continued softness in our contract manufacturing business. We expect fourth quarter pork input cost to decrease seasonally. We continue to assume full year pork input cost to be higher than the last year and above five year averages. In turkey, our supply remains healthy, and we are in a strong position to service our customers and attract new business opportunities. We are projecting growth across several parts of our Jennie-O branded turkey business, including lean ground turkey in retail and value added turkey in foodservice. Lower volumes and pricing for commodity whole turkeys are expected to continue to pressure earnings. As Jim noted, the Suffolk production disruption impacted our third quarter earnings. We realized a $0.03 earnings per share drag during the third quarter and are now estimating an additional $0.03 earnings per share impact in the fourth quarter. This update accounts for a slower production restart than was originally estimated, commercial impacts, facility and maintenance expenses, incremental co-packer costs, and reduced marketing expenses. Additionally, we experienced storm damage to our Papillion, Nebraska facility early in the fourth quarter. We are assessing the financial impact resulting from this event. Consistent with our prior guidance, our full year outlook assumes higher salaries, normalized employee related expenses, and cost associated with planned investments in the business, including higher year-over-year advertising investments. Finally, our earnings per share guidance assumes the strongest contribution of the year from our transform and modernize initiative in the fourth quarter. Taken together, we are maintaining the midpoint of our EPS guidance and in narrowing the range. To conclude my remarks, I would like to highlight the release of our 2023 Global Impact Report, a comprehensive update to our 20 By 30 Challenge. The report highlights meaningful progress against our goals and I would like to mention four key wins that I'm particularly proud of : One, we achieved the safest year in our company's history. Our lowest recordable incident rate ever. Two, our packaging team's sustainability initiatives resulted in nearly 1.7 million pounds in material savings, resulting from optimized package designs and improved shipping efficiencies. Three, more than 200 dependents of our U.S. team members are utilizing the opportunity for a free two year college education through the company's groundbreaking tuition program, Inspired Pathways. Four, we continue to invest in the communities in which we operate, contributing more than $12.5 million in cash and products to uplift communities. This includes investment in the hometown food security project across sector coalition working to alleviate food insecurity in Mower County, Minnesota. There are many other meaningful updates featured in our Global Impact Report and I encourage you to take a look. I would like to extend my thanks to the teams committed to achieving our corporate responsibility goals and completing our 20 By 30 Challenge. Now, I will turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer session. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ben Theurer with Barclays. Your line is now open. Benjamin Theurer : Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question, Jim, Jacinth. So, just wanted to start off maybe with the update to the guidance and if you could give us a little bit more clarity and what you're seeing in terms of like the high end versus the low-end? I mean, you took down sales by about $300 million, but there's still a range of about $300 million. So, what are the potential outcomes here as it relates to the top line? And then if you can break this down, why the lower top line has no impact down on the profit line as EPS was essentially just narrowed, but not changed? Jim Snee : Yeah. Good morning, Ben. Thanks for the question. Obviously, there's a lot there. I think it's important for us to start with the third quarter. And the performance in the third quarter on the top line, the decline really is driven by three primary things. We talked about the three quarters of the top line being driven by turkey contract manufacturing Planters. We still have -- the second thing is, we still have some impact in our convenient meals and protein pricing that we've taken. We're seeing the benefit of the pricing, but that is still having some minimal impact. And then the third factor in the quarter is the comparison in our International group, where we're really lapping some high volume, low margin commodity business from last year in the third quarter. So, that's the decline in there for the third quarter. And as we look forward into the fourth quarter, there's a couple of things that are similar, but also some things that are different. From a market perspective, they're high, but they're not as high as we expected. So that will continue to impact us Jacinth and I both talked about the impact of our Suffolk product or plant disruption, that had an impact in third quarter, will continue to have an impact in Q4 as we continue to ramp back up and we get improved fill rates, the continued headwind of our contract manufacturing. And then again, the lapping in HFIC. So, I mean you put all those things together and that's how we get to the range. When we think about what could take us one way or another and why we're able to really keep the bottom line the same is a lot of the declines were high volume, low margins, in some cases negative margins piece of the business. And what we're talking about in terms of improvement on the bottom line, we've got our international business, which continues to rebound and improve off of last year. Our retail business, there's strength in the underlying core business. I mean, we're seeing key retail brands, Bacon, Jennie-O, Skippy, Applegate, SPAM all performed really, really well. We talked about -- we expect Q4 to be -- to continue to build in terms of our transform and modernize initiative and we'll have an opportunity to speak in more detail on the Q4 call. So all of those things, it's a long answer, but when you package all those things, that's what gets us to that top line guide while still being able to maintain the bottom line midpoint and being able to narrow the range. Benjamin Theurer : Okay. Perfect. And then -- thanks for that, very clear. And then I have one quick follow-up on just the foodservice dynamics. I mean we're still seeing volume growth, but not as elevated as at the beginning of the year. So, as you look into the fourth quarter, what are you seeing from your customers in foodservice as it relates to like the momentum in volume? Jim Snee : Yeah. I mean, we still expect solid volume and sales growth from our Foodservice business, that top line growth has been really broad-based, which has been encouraging, not only across our product categories but the different segments within foodservice in which we compete. Foodservice is on track for a record year. So foodservice remains strong and well positioned to drive value for us. Benjamin Theurer : Perfect. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Jim Snee : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Good morning, and thank you. First question, I was unclear, does your guidance include any potential financial impact from the storm damage? And I wanted to get a sense of what -- maybe the range of possibilities to your bottom line was from the storm? Jacinth Smiley : Yeah. Good morning, Ken. So yes, we did have this unfortunate damage from the storm earlier in the quarter and our production is fully back up and running. In addition, we also have redundant capacity as well for our plant. And when we think about impact from a sales perspective, then that doesn't at all impact sales. The cost that we're talking about and calling out is really to repair our facility, so it has no impact at all on our top line. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. I'll follow-up on that one. And then my second question, and maybe this is a little more direct than I intended to be, but why are you selling products for zero or negative margin? Is it mainly to spread fixed overhead over a bigger revenue base? And I guess the broader question there is, how do we think about the potential down the road for maybe incremental supply chain efficiencies that could allow you to reduce your need or desire to sell product from a co-man or commodity perspective that doesn't really help your bottom line directly? Jim Snee : Yeah. Ken, there's a couple of things there. So the first part of it is, we do have, on the pork side and the turkey side, live harvests. And when you're harvesting animals, we sell everything. And so our goal, and we've been very successful at it, is to continue to move up that value added ladder. And so we feel really good about the progress we've made over the decades, but there's still always going to be elements of that, that are more commodity driven. And depending what the market conditions are, we may find ourselves in that situation and so that part isn't going to change. I guess the second part, and it's an important part of the work that we're doing in transform and modernize, is the total portfolio optimization. Because it is exactly what you say is that we don't want to find ourselves in that position, where we're selling non-strategic items at negative margin. And so our team has been hard at work at that over this last year and we'll start to see the effects of that towards the end of this year into '25 and '26. We'll again be able to provide more clarity on the Q4 call, but it is in our minds, two distinct different areas. There's a part of the business that just naturally flows. The second part is a piece that we can and will take action on. Kenneth Goldman : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good morning. I maybe just wanted to start with turkey. I believe previously you had said it was about a $0.15 headwind into the earnings for fiscal '24. So I just wanted to confirm that that's still the number? And then the second part of that question just, Jim, if turkey fundamentals just don't improve from here, let's say they don't get worse, they don't get better, they just kind of flatline. Is there any sense of how much of that $0.15 you can recover next year, simply if the supply demand situation stays the same, but maybe some other inputs or supply chain get better at this point? Jim Snee : Yeah, Peter. Thanks for the question. Peter, the first part of your question, really, there's no change. And that goes back to what we guided on the Q1 call, that everything's played out the way we thought, and that $0.15 is still the number. The second part of your question, obviously, is a lot more nuanced, and it's not to avoid the question, but there really are so many moving parts in terms of what's happening in the marketplace right now. As we start to look into '25, there's still many, many unknowns. I think it's fair to say we've all seen that egg sets are way down. There's always the uncertainty that, of what\u2019s going to happen with any disease. What\u2019s going to happen with the grain markets. So our focus is, as we said, probably two years ago now, as we worked through the JOTS integration was our goal is to become a more demand driven organization. And we've had a lot of success doing that. We're continuing on that journey, both in retail and foodservice. Obviously, there's been some dynamics in '24 that have negatively impacted the whole bird business. But really as we go to '25, it's still a bit too early given all of the moving parts. Peter Galbo : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Jim, if I go back to when the Planters deal was initially announced, I think a lot of the thesis that the management team had was, if we invested more in marketing and this was a business that was kind of starved for capital, that the results could improve pretty dramatically. And I guess there's been an improvement on the marketing side. But just as you've kind of evaluated and now with the recall and the issues at the plant, just what levels of underinvestment were there kind of in the operations or in the facility? As we just think about if this is truly contained at this point from an impact standpoint on the next few quarters? Thanks very much. Jim Snee : Yeah. Thanks. The thesis going back to the -- for the business at the time of acquisition mean, still holds. And I think we just prior to the production disruption, we're demonstrating the value of what we could do for the business and it was hitting on all cylinders. When we think about distribution gains, innovation gains, really connecting with younger different consumers on the retail side, driving the C-store business not only just for the Planters business but having that synergistic effect across our entire food safety portfolio. I mean it was playing out. It is playing out the way that we thought. And when you acquire facilities, obviously, we did significant due diligence and our -- we felt like we were in a good position. But as we took over the business, we were able to implement a lot of our food safety protocols, which were enhanced environmental and product testing since we've owned the business. And that allowed us to find this issue early and be able to address it. So while we could talk about the financial impact and what was right, what was wrong. The fact is our system worked. We found what we needed to find, we addressed it and we're doing the right thing. The plant was down for five weeks. The ramp-up has taken us a little longer than we thought. But as we're ramping back up, obviously, we expect demand to correct and we'll be able to get back on track to really deliver on that original thesis, which was to drive our whole enterprise entertaining and snacking portfolio. So we're still very excited about the business. Obviously, this disruption is never a good thing, but the team has done great work and feel like we'll be able to get back to hitting on all cylinders in the not-too-distant future. Peter Galbo : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Deanna, also congrats on your retirement. Just starting out with volumes. How did volumes play out versus your expectations for the quarter? Jim Snee : The biggest things for us Rupesh in the third quarter was the Planters volume was lower than we expected. We talk about the contract manufacturing piece, that was another part that was significantly lower than we expected. Turkey was a decline year-over-year, but largely in-line with what we did expect. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then I'm not sure how much you can comment on this. But as we look to the next fiscal year, just any initial puts and takes you can share? Obviously, Planters could be a tailwind as we go into next year. Both want to get a sense of whole bird turkey and just contract manufacturing if we -- maybe those could be a net neutral or even positive as we look out to next year. Jim Snee : Yeah. I mean, it -- I'm going to say that it's early for us to be talking about 2025. But I do think there are some specific areas that as we're starting to look into that timeframe and think about it to the comments I just made, obviously, we expect Planters to be able to rebound and hit again on all cylinders, both retail, foodservice. The continued build-in our transform and modernize initiative, we expect to be able to maintain some of the momentum in our key retail brands. Our international business is really hitting its stride and we expect that to continue to grow. The other part in all of this is to make sure you have the available capacity to grow. And so we have spent a lot of time on that as well to make sure that we have the necessary capacity to support some of our strategic growth areas. And then as I commented on Peter's question, the turkey part just is so dynamic and has so many moving parts that it's really early at this point. But yeah, there's a lot of puts and takes, but there's a lot to like about the work that we've been doing and that's why we're excited about the position we're in, even though we're navigating some of these identified headwinds. Rupesh Parikh : Great. Thank you for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Just one more back on Planters. You mentioned with the additional $0.03 expected impact and stretching into 4Q. But you had said I think the term was commercial impact along with some of the other things you cited. And I just want to make sure I understand exactly what that means. And is that -- does that point to any potential distribution losses you might have to recover? And if so, could that stretch into fiscal '25? Jim Snee : Yeah. Michael, it is, the commercial impact is the sales impact that we're missing out on. At this point, we have not had any distribution losses. Obviously, we've been able to work through inventory. We're ramping up production, supplementing that with co-manufacturing. And although, we're not where we need to be, we're certainly navigating the situation and in constant communication with our customers. The part that we don't want to lose sight of is that Planters is a very, very important brand in this category. And so when we're talking to customers, there is that recognition. They always want us back up and running faster. We want to be back up and running faster. But it's an important part of the category. And we can't tell you today exactly what type of spillover there might be into 2025. But again, we're doing everything that we can to make sure that we're filling those needs. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. And just on the CapEx guide that you're holding. It points to a pretty big spend in 4Q. Is that correct? And just what -- maybe what would some of that be? You didn't change it. So I guess it's not the sort of fix-up costs for the storm damage. What's -- any color on just the -- what seems like a big spike up in the -- late in the year in CapEx? Jacinth Smiley : Yeah. Good morning, Michael. So you are correct and this is fairly consistent actually with how it sequences during the year. And so Q4, we typically do see a big spend. And so we're comfortable with achieving that amount, $280 million that we have put out for the year. So, nothing really unusual in terms of the spend this time of the year. Jim Snee : And our engineering team does a really good job of scrubbing the projects and the spend rate throughout the year. So yeah, we feel like we're in a good position. Michael Lavery : Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Heather Jones with Heather Jones Research. Your line is now open. Heather Jones : Good morning. Thanks for the question. My first question is going back to whole bird turkey and co-man comment. I think you all said they represented roughly three quarters of the net sales declines. But given their lower price points, is it fair to think that they are -- were a bigger chunk of the volume decline? And just wondering when those comparisons will be cycled? Jim Snee : Yeah. I mean, I think it's -- from a volume perspective, it's fairly equal. As we're working through the holiday season for 2024, we'll get better visibility in terms of what the demand is, what the sell through is, what the supply side of the business is. And so, while it would be nice to say that you're going to have a clear read heading into 2025, those read throughs tend to be a bit delayed. So, it will be probably spring of 2025 before we're really able to give a better view of how that cycle looks. Heather Jones : And what about the co-man side? Is that -- you're talking about that as well or just were your comments more on the whole bird side? Jim Snee : That was more on the whole bird side. So I'm sorry, Heather, I missed your co-man question. Could you go-ahead and elaborate on that again? Heather Jones : Well, you were -- you all said that co-man Planters and whole bird were roughly 3/4 of the net sales decline in the quarter. And they're lower-price points. I was assuming they're a bigger chunk of the volume decline. And then I was wondering when you think you'll cycle the co-man softness? Jim Snee : Yeah. So Heather, just what we've said is it's got contract manufacturing and so that is a facility Century Foods that we own. And so we're -- I mean, we're constantly working on that business to drive demand and bring new business into the facility. So that is not a co-manufacturing issue. It's a facility that we own and we refer to it as contract manufacturing. Heather Jones : Okay. And then my second question is going back to your Analyst Day last year and targeting $250 million and EBIT improvement by '26, it seems like this year is likely to be down year-on-year, so implying a greater lift by '26. And just wondering, given what's happened with Planters and whole birds, et cetera, is there anything that changes your view as to that -- the achievability of that? Jacinth Smiley : Good morning, Heather. I -- just in terms of clarity, you mentioned that we're down year-over-year. I'm not sure I'm clear on that piece of it. What I can tell you is that we are tracking really well towards achieving that $250 million by 2026 and we'll definitely give more color in the Q4 call. As we talked about during our investor call, October last year, we called this year as being 2024 a year of investment for sure. And so there will be a pretty good ramp '25 to '26. That being said, we are seeing really meaningful impact to our margins and our bottom line here in 2024, irrespective of that. Heather Jones : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Samuelson : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jim Snee : Good morning, Adam. Adam Samuelson : Maybe kind of following up on Heather's question in a slightly different way. I know you're going to give a bigger discussion of the transform and modernize initiatives on the fourth quarter call, but can you help dimensionalize the amount of savings that you have realized year-to-date from those initiatives. You talked about the fourth quarter being the strongest contributor from those initiatives of the year. So what ballpark are those expected to be on a year-on-year basis as we start to then think about that annualized run rate into 2025. Jim Snee : Yeah. And Adam, we are going to provide a deeper dive in Q4. And so that is going to be the better opportunity for us to talk about what we've been able to achieve financially in '24 and how we're thinking about '25. What I would say is, we talked today in the prepared remarks about planning the business and making the business. But equally important is the work that we're doing on the buy side and we are realizing benefits from our procurement savings, expected logistics supplies from a move perspective, having the analytics across our refrigerated network to enhance our service levels. And just -- I mean, just in general, our processes are really developing and maturing. We'll also have the opportunity to talk about portfolio optimization. And so, we're not in a position to get into the financial part today, but rest assured, we will do that on the Q4 call. Jacinth Smiley : Yeah. No, and I'll just add as well, Adam, you'll see some of the benefits that you see showing up here in terms of the margin expansion in the business is a direct result of those savings that's falling through the bottom line from different places in the P&L, whether that's from a gross margin standpoint or truly to earnings where we're driving that savings and efficiency in our supply chain. So stay tuned here for our call in Q4 for us to really give you a lot more color there.0 Adam Samuelson : Okay. I appreciate that. And if I could just ask a follow-up just on the sales guidance for the fourth quarter kind of implies down 6% to up 4% year-over-year. Just any kind of rough framing on the split there between kind of volume versus price mix and kind of company level by segment for the fourth quarter as you're thinking about it? I know there can be a lot of noise with the commodity turkey whole birds and some of the fresh meat exports and the co-man. So just help clarify kind of where those are going to kind of through the P&L or through the sales line in the different businesses? Thank you. Jim Snee : Yeah. Thanks, Adam. So as we're thinking about the Q4 outlook, we expect the retail business to be down mid-single digits. A lot of the retail dynamics will be similar. We talked about contract manufacturing, not co-mans, some of the market impact that we had originally thought was going to be there as we continue to work through the Planter situation. But mid-single digits is a good number for retail. We expect food service to be up mid-single digits. International, will be lapping on the volume side, commodity business again, but we do see improved mix that will get sales to low single-digits and it gets us to the range you're describing, which is really low, low single-digits. But I think the takeaway here is we can do that math, but the core business is very healthy for retail, foodservice and International. Adam Samuelson : Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee for closing remarks. Jim Snee : We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of better-than-expected earnings. While we continue to navigate several identified headwinds, our team remains focused on finishing the year strong and delivering on our commitments. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and hope you have a good rest of the week. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

I will now turn the call over to Jim Snee. Jim Snee : Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone. In fiscal 2024, we demonstrated the solid execution of our strategy, the power of our portfolio and the resilience of our team. In our business segments, we navigated a dynamic macro consumer environment by reinvesting in our brands, expanding market presence and introducing innovative solutions across our portfolio. In doing so, we delivered solid results coming in line with our adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations for the year. We made significant progress in the first year of our Transform and Modernize initiative, delivering an impressive $75 million in operating income benefit and setting our company up for growth and long-term success. With our disciplined financial approach, the strength of our value-added portfolio and the benefits from Transform and Modernize, we delivered a record year of operating cash flow enabling us to return a record amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends. In Retail, we leveraged the strength of our brands by prioritizing resources towards brands and categories where we know we can win. Flagship and rising brands such as Hormel Black Label, Jennie-O, SPAM and Applegate delivered strong growth and expanded households across on-trend categories. We brought meaningful consumer-centric innovation to our brands and fueled their growth through increased advertising investments. We continue to expand our leadership in our Foodservice segment, growing net sales by 6%, well above industry growth. This success highlighted the differentiated value and relevant offerings our dedicated team brings to the industry. The team executed on our strategic priorities by launching solution-based innovation for our operators and drove impressive growth in the convenience channel by expanding distribution of entertaining and snacking brands like Columbus and Gatherings. And as expected, we saw the strong recovery of our International segment. We increased branded exports for the SPAM family of products and Skippy peanut butter. We drove growth from investments in the Philippines and Indonesia and achieved a solid recovery of our China business. We remain well-positioned to deliver growth and expand our global presence. In addition to delivering on expectations and driving momentum with our value-added portfolio, we accomplished other considerable milestones in fiscal 2024. We drove a 140 basis point increase in our estimated net sales from innovation. Successful innovation underscores the importance of understanding consumer and operator needs and delivering effective solutions, especially in this dynamic macro environment. Our brand teams understand that consumers are hungry for new food experiences both in home and away from home. Innovation will continue to be foundational to our growth strategy supported by our exceptional R&D professionals, signature chefs and Brand Fuel team and the safety of our employees will always remain a pillar of our culture. I am proud to report that in fiscal 2024, we achieved our safest year in our company's history. This milestone is fundamental to our success and a testament to our team members' focus on our SAFETY FIRST culture. Cash flow has always been a bedrock of our company and this year we broke our all-time record for operating cash flow, delivering $1.3 billion for the year. The strength of our portfolio, the disciplined operation of our business and the success of our T&M initiative allowed us to deliver this significant achievement. As a result of our record operating cash flow and disciplined capital allocation strategy, we once again returned a record amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. We also recently announced the 59th consecutive increase to our annual dividend, a record we are incredibly proud of. There are a number of reasons to be excited about the position we are in today because in fiscal '24 we overcame significant headwinds to deliver our earnings guidance. We leveraged the strength of our value-added portfolio across our Retail, Foodservice and International segments and we delivered $75 million of operating income benefits through our Transform and Modernize initiative. As we head into 2025, our brands continue to have either number one or number two share positions in over 40 retail categories. We are making strategic investments into flagship and rising brands like Hormel Black Label bacon, Planters, SPAM, Applegate and Jennie-O. Our Foodservice segment continues to provide unique value in the marketplace and our International segment is well-positioned to deliver growth and expand our global presence. Transform and Modernize is on track, delivering value and helping to return the company to its historical earnings trajectory. There is a growth mindset embedded in our culture allowing us to be more competitive, agile and capital-efficient. We are fueling investments back into the business to drive growth and deliver shareholder returns. The momentum in our underlying business coupled with the strength of our most transformative initiative ever gives me great confidence in our team, brands and companies. I will now transition the call to Jacinth for her remarks. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you, Jim. And to everyone joining us today, I would like to echo Jim's comments around the confidence in our business, the power of our portfolio and the strength of our global team and culture. Volume for the fourth quarter was 1.1 billion pounds and the net sales were $3.1 billion. For the full year, volume was 4.3 billion pounds and net sales were $11.9 billion. Gross margin in the fourth quarter and full year increased 50 basis points to 16.6% and 17%, respectively. This reflects the strength of our value-added portfolio and the early successes of our Transform and Modernize Initiative. Full year SG&A expenses increased compared to last year primarily due to employee-related expenses and the T&M initiative. We expect SG&A expenses to increase in fiscal 2025. Advertising investments for fiscal 2024 were $163 million, up 2% compared to last year. We have planned for double-digit percentage increases in advertising investments in fiscal 2025. For fiscal 2024, interest and investment income increased due to favorable Rabbi Trust performance and higher interest rate. Interest expense increased due to higher rates on debt issued during the year. Our fiscal 2025 expectations assume lower interest and investment income and comparable interest expense. Operating income for fiscal 2024 was $1.1 billion, operating margin was 9% and adjusted operating margin was 9.6%. The tax rate for fiscal 2024 was 22.3% and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is expected to be in the range of 22% to 23%. For the full year, diluted net earnings per share was $1.47 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.58. Turning now to the balance sheet, we remain committed to dividend growth, investing in our business and maintaining our investment-grade rating. Our record cash flows from operations of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2024 and disciplined financial strategy directly support these commitments. In fiscal 2024, we returned a record $615 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends, including payment of our 385th consecutive quarterly dividend. We also recently announced an increase of our annual dividend of 3% to $1.16 per share for fiscal 2025. This will represent a remarkable 59th consecutive year of dividend increases. We invested $256 million in capital projects during fiscal 2024 and our largest projects were focused on capacity for value-added growth. We are targeting between $275 million and $300 million in capital projects for fiscal 2025. We ended the year with $2.9 billion of debt and over $765 million in cash and short-term securities. We remain comfortably within our stated goal of 1.5 times to 2 times net debt to EBITDA. Inventories finished the year at $1.6 billion, a decrease of $104 million from the beginning of the year. We enter fiscal 2025 with responsible levels of inventory to service our customers and ample production capacity to grow our business. Finally, I would like to provide additional color on a few items from fiscal 2024. First, as we noted during our third quarter earnings call, we experienced storm damage to our Papillion, Nebraska facility in early Q4. This event resulted in approximately $9 million of negative impact for the fourth quarter. Second, we made significant progress during the quarter regarding the Suffolk production disruption. We are improving fill rates, regaining distribution, refilling shelves and prioritizing innovation. At the same time, we do expect some near-term commercial impacts and higher costs, most notably in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We expect to benefit from the recaptured momentum in the Planters brand starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Lastly, in the final week of the fiscal year, we divested of our Hormel Health Labs business which was reported in our Foodservice segment and contributed 64 million pounds and $108 million of net sales to our top line and approximately one penny to adjusted EPS in fiscal 2024 which will not be repeated in future years. Shifting now to our fiscal 2025 outlook, we expect each segment to deliver top line growth as we continue to provide innovative offerings in the marketplace and increase investments in our brands. For full year fiscal 2025, we expect the following in each of our segments : Retail, comparable volume and low-single-digit increases in net sales; Foodservice after adjusting for Hormel Health Labs divestiture, mid-single-digit increases in volume and mid-single-digit increases in net sales; and for International, low-single-digit increases in volume and high-single-digit increases in net sales. We also anticipate segment profit growth from each segment for the full year with growth weighted towards the back half of the year. Regarding key input cost assumptions in our fiscal 2025 outlook, we expect pork input costs to be comparable to fiscal 2024 and remain above the five-year average; beef costs to continue to be a headwind, nut input costs to be a drag year-over-year; turkey markets to continue to be depressed for the full year with lower year-over-year whole bird prices specifically in the first quarter. Our outlook also accounts for a moderate benefit due to favorable grain prices. I would also like to note that we expect $0.04 to $0.05 of unfavorable earnings per share impact in the first quarter from lower year-over-year whole bird prices and the Suffolk production disruption. In total, we expect net sales of $11.9 billion to $12.2 billion, organic net sales growth of 1% to 3%, adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.58 to $1.72, and an estimated $100 million to $150 million of incremental benefits from the T&M initiative. To the entire Hormel Foods team around the globe, I thank you for your dedicated efforts in fiscal 2024 and I look forward to achieving our fiscal 2025 goals working alongside you. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Snee : Thanks, Jacinth. Please advance to Slide 13, where we will begin the next portion of our call and provide an update on our Transformation initiative. I will provide a brief introduction before turning the call over to Jacinth and Nathan. Just over one year ago at our 2023 Investor Day, we announced the most transformative initiative in our company's history. Our commitment is to transform and modernize our processes, our portfolio and the way we create value. We are doing this by investing in our people, data and technology and our brands. Today, you will hear about the significant progress we made in 2024 against our commitment. At Investor Day, we described three interconnected buckets of opportunity for earnings growth. As a reminder, the purpose of our growth initiative is to regain historical predictable earnings growth and drive long-term value. The Transform and Modernize benefits generate incremental investment to drive business growth. As our business grows, we expect to deliver even more benefits through our Transformational initiative. We are creating a sustainable growth engine for the company and watching year one unfold in such a powerful way gives me confidence in our future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jacinth for you to hear more about our progress. Jacinth Smiley : Thanks, Jim. As Jim noted, we have made significant progress in year one. I will take a few minutes to talk about our successes to date and our expectations over the next two years inclusive of the investments we're making to drive those benefits. As a reminder, Transform and Modernize is not just a cost-savings exercise, although that certainly is a real and substantial benefit. Rather, Transform and Modernize is about the way we do business across the enterprise and it involves every single member of the Hormel Foods team. It is about reshaping how we operate, creating new opportunities for growth and generating a powerful growth flywheel. And to make all that happen, we're making strategic investments in key areas of the business. As we shared with you last year, we have organized the initiative into five pillars. Four of those pillars focus on supply chain efficiency. With Plan, we're adopting a holistic approach to end-to-end planning. With Buy, we're implementing numerous sourcing events to reduce costs and improve our procurement structure and tools. With Make, we're standardizing ways of working to improve yields, increase capacity and avoid unnecessary CapEx. And with Move, we're assessing and addressing near-term capacity and long-term network optimization. Regarding Portfolio Optimization, we're finding new ways to reduce complexity, address low-margin items and create room in our portfolio for further innovation. This work is being done at both the brand and business level to ensure our portfolio reflects our company's strategy and leverages our core competencies. Nathan will be providing more detail and actual examples for each of these five pillars in just a few minutes. But before I turn it over to Nathan, I want to reiterate that year one of Transform and Modernize was a success, delivering $75 million dollars in benefits. It is important to note, however, that this only reflects the benefits from the Buy, Make and Move pillars of our T&M initiative. Specifically, we have seen the greatest savings from the improvements in logistics followed by raw materials and supplies, and then manufacturing efficiencies. Looking at fiscal 2025, we're expecting annualized operating income benefits from T&M to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million compared with 2024 operating income, and that is an addition to the $75 million we achieved this past year. In fiscal 2025, we expect the largest savings from these efforts to come through raw materials and supplies, followed by significant benefits from manufacturing and logistics. We also made excellent progress with our Plan and Portfolio Optimization pillars. With our Plan pillar, we expanded on our end-to-end planning capabilities. We're building an infrastructure that ensures a more accurate demand signal flows through to our supply planning and that is absolutely critical. With Portfolio Optimization, we have made progress in harnessing the power of our portfolio, which is resulting in a more consumer-centric, less complex, more profitable product mix. More broadly, we believe the T&M initiative is enhancing Hormel Foods' capabilities and unlocking our full potential. As I mentioned before, this is not just a cost-savings initiative. We are making foundational investments in data and technology and people and processes to transform our company. In total, we're expecting to spend approximately $250 million through 2026. Taking a closer look at our spend within the people and process category, we are investing in talent and upskilling our team members while creating a much more data-driven and analytical organization with modern processes. Importantly, we are driving complexity out of the organization. With our data and technology investments, we are building the analytical capabilities to make empowered decisions based on strategic insights to gain a competitive edge across all of our businesses. Ultimately, we believe we are creating an incredibly powerful flywheel of sustained value creation. By focusing on investments, transformation and growth, we are laying the foundation for profitable and predictable growth, not just today, but for years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nathan Annis, our Vice President of Corporate Development, who will provide a deeper dive into our Transformational initiatives. Nathan Annis : Thank you, Jacinth. It has been a couple years since 2021 when I was last in Investor Relations and it's exciting to be back giving you an update on our Transform and Modernize initiative and to review some case studies that highlight our progress and the value we're creating. Our Transform and Modernize initiative is reshaping how we operate across the company in four key ways. First, our processes have historically been built on deep institutional knowledge and were quite manual. As our company has grown, these processes became more complex and highly customized. We have started transforming these processes into streamlined, enterprise-wide ways of working that leverage intelligent automation and digitization. I cannot overstate how critical this change is to all the work we are doing in our initiative. Next, our key capabilities like business planning and execution used to be siloed and under-leveraged. Over the recent years and quarters, we've moved to centralize these functions to capitalize on our scale while also strategically investing in areas where we are differentiated in the marketplace. Historically, our business was overly complex, bogged down by a lengthy list of vendors and SKUs. Looking ahead, we are simplifying our operations in a smart, data-driven way. We're also strategically segmenting our business to optimize our investment. Last, where we once had a variety of methods for identifying and realizing value in savings, we now use a standardized, more disciplined approach. This new process ensures we are capturing value consistently with clear accountability tied to key metrics. These four strategic changes are integral to the work we are doing and our team is setting a new standard for excellence in these areas. Now let's explore some specific examples of how these changes are making a difference in the five pillars, beginning with Buy. This pillar represents a comprehensive enterprise effort to develop a new framework and tools for procuring goods and services across the entire organization. Our prior efforts of creating One Supply Chain and restructuring our segments through Go Forward are paying dividends as we scope opportunities. Viewing procurement through an enterprise-wide lens allows us to significantly transform how we operate. For instance, we're establishing a new operating model that includes a modern structure, standardized training and updated policies and governance. Additionally, we're adopting new procurement systems such as advanced sourcing tools, should cost modeling capabilities and enhanced data visibility and analytics. In 2024, we began implementing the Buy pillar by focusing on categories in cost of goods sold and indirect spend. For 2025, our goal is to target the remaining categories across our P&L. By 2026, we expect this new approach will be fully embedded in our culture and we anticipate benefiting from consistent year-over-year productivity growth. A great example of our efforts with the Buy pillar is a recent sourcing event focused on routine supplies and parts for our manufacturing facilities. In the past, these items were procured through a fragmented process with 100s of vendors and inconsistent purchasing methods. By streamlining our sourcing strategy and using enterprise-wide agreements, we've significantly reduced complexity and our number of vendors while targeting improvements in our inventory levels. This project is just one of many that we are implementing to drive value. By incorporating these new tools and methodologies into our operations, we are developing a procurement function that delivers substantial financial savings, boosts cash flow and sets the foundation for sustainable benefits well into the future. In the Make pillar, we are transforming the way we manage our manufacturing network to boost efficiency, increase capacity and reduce cost through the implementation of our proprietary Hormel Production System, or HPS. The essence of HPS lies in standardizing the ways of working across all our manufacturing facilities. By introducing consistent management processes backed by a maturity model that ensures accountability, we're embedding the right practices at every level of our organization. Initially, we've concentrated these efforts on facilities facing capacity limitations. HPS is not only enhancing production yields and improving capacity, but also boosting team member engagement while reducing downtime, working capital and overall cost. A standout success story from the Hormel Production System comes from our efforts to address production bottlenecks for Hormel BACON 1 fully cooked bacon at our Wichita, Kansas facility. Our Foodservice team has consistently driven growth for this differentiated and highly profitable brand, but our capacity limitations were hindering our ability to fully meet demand. A possible solution was to add new production lines, which would have been expensive and require significant lead time to implement. By deploying HPS at Wichita, we increased capacity by approximately 18%. This increase not only allows us to meet future demand, but also brings lasting improvements in productivity, cost efficiency and team morale. By extending these best practices to other facilities facing similar challenges, we're enhancing the agility and responsiveness of our manufacturing network. This shift not only helps us keep pace with current demand, but also lays the groundwork for sustained long-term growth. Our Move pillar is all about enhancing our logistics network and boosting distribution capacity. A significant achievement in this pillar has been the renegotiation of enterprise-wide freight rates. With a detailed freight RFP process supported by our procurement team, we have secured immediate cost reductions. Additionally, we have optimized the flow of finished goods through our network, effectively lowering landed cost. Looking forward, a key milestone for the Move pillar will be the opening of a new distribution center in the Memphis metropolitan area. Scheduled to become operational in the second half of 2025, we expect this facility will greatly improve our inventory management and expand our distribution capability. Reiterating what Jacinth shared, our investments go beyond just cutting costs, they're crucial for creating a more robust and scalable logistics network. The Plan pillar is perhaps the most extensive and complex of our five pillars and we believe our work here will revolutionize our approach to end-to-end planning across the company. Historically, our planning processes have been overly manual, dependent on spreadsheets, legacy technology and numerous different processes. Our efforts are fundamentally transforming our planning function by centralizing these activities, adopting integrated business planning across all business units, and embedding more data analytics and AI to guide our decisions. We believe this comprehensive, integrated and scalable approach will enhance service levels, reduce cost, decrease working capital and improve engagement for 100s of team members across various functions. This all sets the stage for a more efficient and responsive organization. Portfolio Optimization is a critical element of this initiative and is designed to reshape our product portfolio to improve margins and drive top line growth. This strategic focus touches all pillars and ultimately enables us to streamline operations and concentrate on the most profitable and growth-oriented categories. Historically, we have had a long tail of unprofitable or low-volume items and we have managed these inconsistently across the enterprise. The restructuring of our company through Go Forward has allowed us to take a more enterprise approach and during 2024, our efforts have centered on creating a rigorous process to consistently assess and manage every item in our portfolio. As a result of these strategic evaluations, we've taken decisive steps including divesting a non-strategic business, Hormel Health Labs. Additionally, we've taken action on a large number of low-volume or unprofitable SKUs and we will continue to rightsize our portfolio. Portfolio Optimization is also about strategically reinvesting in innovation and we are tailoring our portfolio to resonate with current consumer and operator trends to fuel sustainable growth. This ongoing process ensures that each product in our portfolio is capable of making a significant contribution to our revenues and margins, ensuring Hormel Foods remains a leader in the marketplace. We made excellent progress in 2024 and we're excited to continue our work and drive accelerated value in 2025 and 2026. Through continued investments in data, people, process and technology, we are unlocking the potential of our people across the enterprise and positively impacting all aspects of our financials. We're incredibly excited by how these five pillars have become increasingly interconnected and how the work has converged with other enterprise objectives. The merging of these activities means that they are rapidly becoming ingrained in our culture and helping to transform Hormel Foods into a more efficient, responsive and competitive company. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Jim. Jim Snee : Thanks, Nathan. As we wrap up our remarks this morning, I think it's important to recognize that we are a stronger company today because of the strategic actions we've taken in the past, like One Supply Chain and Go Forward. These actions, combined with our Transform and Modernize initiative positions us for continuous improvement, profitable and predictable growth and sustainable long-term shareholder value creation. We remain committed to our long-term growth algorithm of generating between 2% to 3% organic net sales growth and between 5% to 7% operating income growth. There are many reasons to believe in our long-term strategy. We have a portfolio of leading and differentiated brands which are fueled by innovation. We are organized for long-term growth with an ability to deliver stable financial performance. And we do all of this with a focus on being a strong corporate citizen. We are building a more efficient, scalable and adaptable organization that is well-positioned to meet the demands of an evolving marketplace. All of this would not be possible without the dedication and performance of our team members and I want to thank them for their hard work and commitment. With that, Jacinth, John, Nathan and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to go back to the FY25 guidance range. I know you guys gave some color in terms of how to think about some of the puts and takes, but I was hoping if you can go deeper into some of the variables to get you to low or high end of the range. And then it sounds like Q1 will be the most challenged. So just also want to get a sense of whether you think you can actually grow earnings in Q1. Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes, thanks. Thanks, Rupesh. The important thing for our 2025 outlook, right, is it demonstrates growth on top and bottom line. It's realistic, it's achievable, and it's consistent with how we've messaged about the business. Now, as we're thinking about 2025, we expect growth in key retail categories. Bacon, Applegate, we've talked about our flagship and rising brands and the success we're having there. Again, this successful pipeline of innovation is going to be really important. The value we create in a unique manner with our Foodservice business, continued growth from International after an impressive rebound in 2024, we do expect growth again in 2025. Our value-added turkey business is an area of business that's really, really strong, whether it's our Lean Ground Turkey or business in Foodservice. The other part, I think, that is really important to call out is the additional brand support that we are planning in 2025. So we've got a strong double-digit increase plan to support our brands and then we'll be making other additional investments as part of this Transformation initiative whether it's the people, the processes, the data and technology. And we have available capacity to support all of this growth that we're expecting. And so we do expect some near-term impacts in Q1, commercial impacts for Planters, wraparound impacts on the whole bird turkey business. And then the other part is really our -- this Transformation and Modernization initiative, over-delivering strong performance in year one, acceleration in year two. And when we put all of that together, that's what really gives us confidence. And so we're entering 2025 with momentum in this underlying business with really great support all around it. And when you couple that with the performance and the strength of the Transformation initiative, that's really where we are and why we have confidence in our ability to grow top and bottom line in 2025. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. And good morning, Rupesh. And in terms of the guide, what Jim just articulated is really what gives us confidence to hit the midpoint. But when we think about what gets us to the higher end of the range, it's a couple key things, right? Higher volume, a better product mix, an improved turkey market, Planters over-delivery and certainly as Jim talked about, just the strength and over-delivery on our T&M initiative certainly gives us the opportunity to get to that higher end. Rupesh Parikh : Great. That's helpful color. Best of luck. Thank you. Jim Snee : Thank you. Jacinth Smiley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you. And just to follow up on that question, your underlying EBIT growth when we just exclude T&M this coming year is expected to decline. I think the math works out that way. You do have -- you talked about some of the headwinds in 1Q. You talked about the investments that you're making. Is there an element of conservatism or prudence or whatever word you want to use? I know, Jim, you had talked over the last year about maybe wanting to add, I don't know, a dash or a dollop of incremental conservatism into your guidance. And I'm just trying to get a sense of if you feel like this range does factor in some unforeseen events to the downside that in a way that maybe you hadn't as a company in the longer term past. Jim Snee : Yes. Ken, thanks. Thanks for the question. Starting with the Transform and Modernize initiative. I think one thing that's really important, and I'm sure we'll talk more about it over the balance of the call, is this really isn't a like standalone dollar amount that we should be looking at because this really is interconnected into the business. And the term that we've started to use internally is this flywheel to generate growth. Because it is, as business grows, we get more benefits. And as we get more benefits, we're able to reinvest in the business. And so, this is a holistic look at our business and the growth that we expect to achieve in 2025. Your comment on conservatism, I think from where we sit, we want to make sure that we're always appropriate. And when we think about items that have had a lot of volatility, we've talked probably unnecessarily about turkey in the last couple of years. And so we want to make sure that given that recent volatility, we are appropriate in how we plan and guide the business. The other part is this Planters' rebound. And we want to make sure again that we get this right as we start to really scale the commercial piece of this, as we've navigated our way through the production concerns that are largely resolved. And so our ability to fill holes faster, right? We're turning on advertising, we're turning on innovation. That's what really, in my mind, makes this plan realistic, achievable and appropriate. Ken Goldman : Great. Thank you. And if I can ask a quick follow-up. Are you still planning on -- I think you are, $250 million of net operating income improvement from '23 to '26. And the reason I'm asking is it just mathematically requires a reasonably high step up in 2026 at this point. Just curious if that's still the case. And if so, kind of what you think without obviously providing '26 guidance, some of those key factors might be. Jim Snee : Yes. Thanks, Ken. You're right, we're not guiding '26, but we are on track for the $250 million. And there are a lot of things to feel good about and that we're excited about. It's this trajectory of T&M after a successful year one which is now interconnected into this flywheel. And we are creating this long-term lasting value. We're building processes, we're building capabilities, but underpinning that is the strength of the brand and the business. We're talking more about flagship and rising brands and how important they are to our portfolio and they're growing, our Foodservice business continuing to be differentiated and growing in the marketplace and then our International piece. So, yes, we're on track and what gives us confidence is really the strength of the underlying business coupled with that transformative initiative. So really, really good progress. And I know you heard from Nathan in the prepared remarks and I'm sure we'll get some additional questions, but we're in a really good place. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Thomas Palmer from Citi. Please go ahead. Thomas Palmer : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jim Snee : Hi, Tom. Thomas Palmer : At the midpoint, your guidance implies around $85 million operating profit growth. You expect $125 million from cost savings and also organic sales growth. I just want to make sure I'm thinking through the pieces you laid out that might limit the flow-through of these two items to operating profit. So it sounds like advertising could be higher in the $20 million range. I think turkey plus Suffolk could net out for the year to maybe a slight headwind. I'm just trying to bridge what else is kind of limiting this flow through, make sure as we think through this year. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. Good morning, Tom. I just want to -- just clarify that our Transform and Modernize initiative isn't just a cost-savings initiative. It is about reinvesting in the business for growth. And Jim mentioned this flywheel and that's exactly how we're thinking about it as we go through what is we're targeting as a three-year initiative, but really it is -- it goes beyond that and it's a foundation to set the company up for long term growth and we're getting value beyond 2026. But in terms of your specific questions as to what's included in the midpoint there, Jim mentioned already how we're thinking about whole bird turkey and how we're thinking about turkey pricing. Certainly, prices were depressed coming out of Q4 and we are expecting that to what we've baked in is for the full year that turkey will remain at those lower levels for 2025, in addition to the fact that we are making double-digit investments in our brand for 2025 and that's included as well in that guide, in addition to investing in capabilities for our business as it relates to the T&M initiative from data and technology and also around our people. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thanks. And then just on what's going on with Suffolk, it's kind of been a couple quarters now delaying the restart. I guess what's really contributing to that slower ramp and why the confidence now that kind of 1Q will be the end of the issues. Jim Snee : Yes, that's an important part of 2025, Tom. And it's important to know that we've made significant progress in Q4 regarding the situation. So our production concerns are largely resolved and we're in a good place from a supply perspective that's ramping up and continuing to build. A couple of other pieces that I think are important and I'm going to let John probably get into more specifics. But as a reminder, right, we had tremendous momentum in the Planters business last year, right, and since the time of acquisition, we've had a lot of positive data, right? The work that we've done, whether it's volume, sales, shares, right, that's what gives us the confidence about where we were and where we know we can get this business back to. And a lot of that work is -- obviously it happens in Retail and Foodservice, but an outsized portion is in Retail. John Ghingo : Yes. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, Tom. So I'll just comment briefly on the Planters' recovery and kind of next steps around Planters. This quarter, the first quarter is largely refilling retailer shelves, replenishing retailer inventories, replenishing our own inventory, essentially refilling all of those gaps that were created in the back half of last year as we dealt with the supply disruption. By the end of the first quarter, we will be in a position to fully meet retailer demand across the entire Planters portfolio. In the meantime, we are seeing some progress in our scanner data. So our baseline trends are improving sequentially over the past two four-week periods, meaning baseline declines are lessening versus prior year. And what's driving that is a restoration of lost distribution on those items that were impacted by the supply disruption at Retail. In fact, more than half of that distribution has been recovered at this point versus where we were at our low point. So we still have more to do over 2025 on that recovery. But we are very encouraged by the good progress at this point. We have chosen in the near term to scale back some of the merchandising activity in particular in November and December. So our Q1 data will be a little bit choppy from the scanner, but we're prioritizing getting the base replenished and getting the shelf back to where it needs to be. Now, as we get into the second quarter, we will start to dial backup promotions, we will dial backup advertising, we will start to attract consumers back to the brand and begin to recapture that momentum that Jim commented on. I mean, in general, Planters is a great platform for us. It's sitting in a wonderful space. The macro snacking space continues to be a great consumer space. The substantial nature of Planters' portfolio really fits with what consumers are looking for in terms of more substantive fuel-oriented snacks. We have a leading brand that's very responsive to advertising, to promotions on its core with a lot of innovation potential. Just looking at some of the innovation we were driving behind our flavored cashews and duos lines, they were attracting new households, bringing in younger consumers. We're going to continue driving that and we have restoration of advertising spend on Planters that will help us do that. Jacinth Smiley : And just a reminder, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but in Q1, as John is mentioning here, that's going to be a period of rate recovering. From a financial impact standpoint, there is going to be $0.04 to $0.05 of impact unfavorably in the quarter split between whole bird turkey and Planters. And that's about a 50/50 split. But the key takeaway here is Planters is a brand that is strong and we expect to benefit from recaptured momentum in Q2. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thank you for all the details. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Heather Jones from Heather Jones Research. Please go ahead. Heather Jones : Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess my first question is wondering, it sounds like as part of the T&M initiative there could be further SKU rationalization. So I was just wondering if the sales and volume guidance you gave, I know it excludes the Hormel Health Labs, but does it anticipate further SKU rationalization? Jim Snee : Yes, I think all of that's embedded in our guidance, Heather. I think your call out on Hormel Health Labs is important. You think about the top line impact of $100 million, the bottom line impact of -- it's a one penny EPS, but that does figure into the year-over-year comparison. The work that we are doing on TPO is included in our guide. I'll maybe ask Nathan to comment a little bit more about it to give you some additional color. Nathan Annis : Yes. Hi, Heather, this is Nathan. As we think about portfolio optimization and how it's built into next year, I would think about it in two different ways. First, it's all baked into the guidance. And as we think about what SKUs are coming out, they're usually unprofitable SKUs or SKUs that are adding complexity. And I think the key takeaway for us is that we're creating the right room in the portfolio to drive innovative new items and the right profitable items. Heather Jones : Okay. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to talk about turkey. So over the years since I followed you guys, I mean, you've taken all these steps in your pork business to make it more and more value-added and to reduce your exposure to the more commodity elements. In the turkey side because of HPA, that business has just become even more cyclical and just the impact on exports, et cetera. But just wondering, I know it's an important value-added business for you to ground turkey, but just was curious as to your thoughts about taking steps on that side to do similarly to what you've done on the pork side of like focusing more on the value add and maybe entering into partnerships that would limit your exposure to the more commodity-volatile side. So I know it's a wide-ranging question, but just broadly, how are you all thinking about that strategically? Jim Snee : Yes, Heather, it is. It's wide-ranging, but it's an important question in terms of the work that we have been doing on an -- or as an organization and where we see this going. And so I think if you do start with that pork analogy that you have, and I think back to my early days in the chair and how frequently we talked about pork operating margins and fast forward eight, nine years, we're not talking about that because of those steps that we took. It still exists, but it's obviously a small portion of the portfolio and the impact that it has. I want to remind you that several years ago, right, we did a lot of work on Jennie-O Turkey Store, our turkey portfolio. We called it Project Tower. I can't remember if we said that publicly, but it really was all about, right, appropriately sizing the supply side of the business. And the phrase that we used was creating a demand-driven business with a goal of exactly what you're saying, right, reduce or minimize the volatility because we don't get any credit for that. And so we had a plan. There's a lot of work that's been done to get that supply to the right size. What has hindered that is the most recent Avian Influenza outbreak because supply then became obviously very disruptive and we weren't able to fully execute some of the actions that we had planned and wanted to put in place. But we are on that track and we agree with your assessment that our goal is to create a demand-driven business and that demand is our focus on the value-added business, right? When we think about the success of Lean Ground Turkey, right, that is the number one scanned item in our company. And when we think about how that aligns with today's consumer, that opportunity is only going to continue to increase. The work that we've done to integrate the business into Foodservice has yielded very positive results. And so you can see how we are setting this business up for long-term success while minimizing the volatility. And so we are focused on the value-added business, Lean Ground Turkey and Retail, broad offerings in Foodservice. And it is a very important part of this portfolio just as -- again, as we think about what's happening in the consumer environment. Heather Jones : Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Max Gumport from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Max Gumport : Hi. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to turn back to the question on '26 because you did reaffirm that the $250 million of growth from '23. It does imply about $200 million of EBIT growth in FY26. It sounds like you'll only have $25 million or so left of the T&M program in '26. Strategic value, I think, was only supposed to contribute $25 million over the three-year period and the goal is to get the base business to grow 5% to 7% in '26 or about $75 million. So it feels like there's a pretty big halt that I'm missing in terms of what would get you to that target in '26. I'm just hoping you could provide a bit of color, just high level given you have reaffirmed a target and you've discussed it previously. Thanks so much. Jacinth Smiley : Good morning, Max. Thanks for the question. And we have indeed reaffirmed our $250 million of expanded operating income by 2026. And I just want to clarify that that number is a net number. So net of our reinvestment in the business, net of inflation. And so going back to what we're calling the growth flywheel, this is all interconnected in terms of the delivery what we're delivering to get to that $250 million. So it is indeed not just a growth number. So when you think about it, we are delivering more than $250 million from our initiatives to be able to actually yield a net $250 million to get to the operating income expansion of the $250 million by 2026. Max Gumport : Got it. But just any other drivers you would point to in terms of what helps you get there? I think if it's a net number, there's probably an even bigger halt I hadn't considered. So just any other key drivers you could point to. Jacinth Smiley : Yes. I mean, it goes back to the items that Jim talked about when we kicked this off in terms of the -- right, our portfolio, our brand, right, our underlying business driving that, our flagship and rising brands continuing to deliver, Foodservice continuing to deliver, the recovery of our International business, and all of the other initiatives within our T&M as well are really driving those. So, I mean, it's everything together and we will -- I mean, certainly, Jim can add additional color here, but it is beyond just the pieces underneath our T&M initiative. Jim Snee : Yes. And Max, first off, it's nice to meet you. And I think the math that you're doing you might imply that there's only so much left in the work that we're doing and that's not at all how we're thinking about this, right? The work that we're doing, successful in '24, accelerating in '25, continuing to accelerate in '26 with benefits to the organization that go well beyond 2026. And you heard from Nathan some of the successes that we've had in 2024, but he may want to elaborate on a few more points. Nathan Annis : Yes. Hi, Max, this is Nathan. As you think about what we're doing in '25, that sets us up for continued success in '26 and beyond, in the Buy pillar where we will have RFP, virtually every category, some categories multiple times. We'll have implemented over a dozen different modules in our end-to-end planning system, like demand planning, scheduling, deployment, that'll yield benefits well into the future. We'll have fully implemented our Hormel Production System across all of our different facilities of an optimized logistics network. And we've really done a -- made more progress reshaping our portfolio, picking up steam, driving more innovation. So we feel really confident about what we're doing now and how that will deliver value in '26 and beyond. Max Gumport : Great. Thanks very much. Nice to meet you guys, too. And I'll leave it there. Jim Snee : Thank you, Max. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Peter Galbo : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Nathan, nice to speak with you again. Nathan Annis : Yes. Good to see you again. Peter Galbo : Jim, not to ask this question six ways to Sunday, but again, I think there's just a lot of confusion now about what this net $250 million means. And maybe just to ask it in a slightly different manner, if I just take the midpoint of your guidance for this year, you'd be up, call it $40 million in EBIT relative to your 2023 starting point. And that's on $200 million of savings kind of program to date. So forgetting about '26 for a moment, maybe we can just clarify that that's the right way to think about kind of the '25 relative to '23 as a starting point. Jim Snee : Yes, that's correct, Peter. Peter Galbo : Okay. So whatever our assumption is on '26 whether that additional $210 million that would have to come through in '26, that's kind of the toggle as to how you would get to your '26 target and that's how we should think about it. Jim Snee : Yes. And I think that's correct, Peter. And there's a couple of pieces as you are thinking about it is this strength of the performance, right, of our growth initiative strong '24, accelerating in '25, continuing to accelerate in '26, right, the recovery of our Planters business, right, the opportunity to grow that business now that we've worked through the situation and are filling on the supply side and getting that business back on track and then the strength of the underlying business, the brands, the business, right? We talked again about flagship and rising brands, Foodservice, International. So it is all interconnected. The math you're doing is right. But those opportunities are there as we look into obviously '25, which we have and as we're thinking about 2026, right? That's why we're saying we're on track, because we're doing the same type of thinking behind the scenes. Peter Galbo : Okay. Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And then if I can just on turkey, I get the -- I think it's $0.025 headwind in the first quarter. I think there was a mention on some benefit from lower grain prices that you're expecting. So is -- maybe I have this wrong, but is the expectation in '25 that turkey on the full year basically ends up being a neutral, again, offsetting the first quarter weakness against kind of a grain benefit? Do we have that correct? Jacinth Smiley : From a grain perspective -- or maybe I'll start first with turkey. I mentioned before that we're expecting turkey pricing to be comparable to our Q4. So we haven't assumed any upside there for the year. From a grains perspective, just a reminder, we strategically hedge our grains to reduce volatility and we've done that for 2025. So we're well-bought into 2025. And so we'll see moderate benefits from grains in 2025. And so that's really what's baked into our guide here. Jim Snee : Yes. And I think just if we -- if you do break it apart into the different components, obviously we -- as Jacinth said, there's some moderate benefit to the grain, our value-added business, we expect growth and then the commodity side of the business, again, we feel like we've planned it appropriately, thinking about it with being flat to slightly down. Peter Galbo : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it. Jim Snee : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good morning. Jim Snee : Morning. Michael Lavery : Just risking belaboring this a little bit further. I want to come back to -- I guess it was partly answering Max's question. Nathan, I think it was you were given some examples beyond just sort of the T&M maybe program or initiatives, but I think they seem to fall under things like portfolio optimization or better procurement or better efficiencies that kind of felt like they're under the umbrella of exactly those initiatives. And so I know there's some blurry lines, especially the deeper you get into it, just in terms of it's not like simply closing a plant, for example, where there's quite discrete costs. But can you just maybe help us understand if you do have most of the T&M savings in hand by the end of fiscal '25, is it just more sort of similar type things to come next that help keep pushing the upside to EBIT, even if you haven't necessarily identified those out of the gate in that kind of starting fiscal '24? Is that the right way to think about it or maybe just help us understand kind of how we should bucket some of these in our heads? Jim Snee : Yes. Michael, this is Jim. I think the first thing I just want to clarify. So your comment about we have all the savings in hand by the end of 2025, that's not what we said, nor do we intend that because there's an acceleration in 2026. And so obviously there's two components of this. There's the three-year initiative that we've laid out, knowing full well that the benefits of this program go well beyond 2026. And maybe just for additional color, Nathan, do you want to just maybe go back to some of the things you were talking about and how you expect the programs to follow through? Nathan Annis : Yes. Hi, Michael, this is Nathan. As you think about all of the different projects that we're doing many of them are creating value, but a lot of them are driving new capabilities that will support our business and really help us beyond '25, '26 and into the future. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's helpful. And just back on Planters, I think initially you felt like you didn't have distribution at risk. It sounds like obviously, you're regaining it now. Maybe what's changed a little bit in terms of how the distribution evolved and maybe one part I want to make sure I understand is in the rebuild, did it get to the point where now there's slotting fees we should be thinking about as you restore that or maybe just help us understand kind of how that -- those moving parts look? Nathan Annis : Yes, I want to handle the first part of that, Michael, because on the last call, we did say that we had not lost any distribution. Since that time, we have had a couple of instances where we have lost distribution. But there are two components to this. And the other component is the loss distribution by not being able to supply the product on the shelf. And I think the work that or the comments that John made earlier really demonstrate kind of the significance or how that splits apart. John, you want to maybe comment on that? John Ghingo : Sure. So if you think about the distribution of Planters, those short-term, I'll call them shelf gaps that resulted from the supply shortage on the SKUs in particular, that were impacted out of Suffolk, that recovery has been going well, right? That's where we have more than half of that distribution back at this point. And largely that distribution comes without slotting, without investment. Where we have other issues, let's say that might be some distribution that we're going to have to work to get back longer term, there could be some investment required to do that, but that's not a major factor in our plan. We're very confident and comfortable that the investments we have built in the plan at this point will get Planters back to growth beginning in the second quarter. Michael Lavery : Okay. That's really helpful clarification. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Pooran Sharma from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Pooran Sharma : Good morning. This is Pooran's associate, Adam. Thanks for taking the question. Jim Snee : Yes. Pooran Sharma : Can you talk about the key drivers of growth within Foodservice and if you could highlight any bright spots for the quarter or maybe how we should think about achieving that mid-single-digit growth next year? Jim Snee : Yes, Adam, thanks for the question. I think for Foodservice, the playbook, so to speak really remains the same. The business remains historically strong and healthy. '24 we had really good volume and net sales growth. We expect good strong growth across the board in 2025. And that growth will be -- it'll be broad-based and across a number of different categories. As we've said many times, we continue to operate from a position of strength through that direct sales team that we have, the portfolio of ongoing innovative product solutions that really are helping operators with their pain points, the diversified channels that we operate in. We've always had really strong presence in commercial or the restaurant segment but over the years, we've built out so many capabilities when you think about lodging, college and university with Planters adding the convenience store muscle. So there's a lot of really good opportunities. Now that's not to say we don't understand what's happening in the macro environment, but we're well-positioned to address that and overcome that with this really differentiated business that we have. It's the direct selling organization, innovation and a keen operator focus that will allow us to deliver really good results in 2025. Pooran Sharma : Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Rahi Parikh from Barclays. Please go ahead. Rahi Parikh : Hi, everyone. I'm on for Ben. Ben Theurer. Just for T&M, I just want to have a different question is, where are you at the end of your full year '24 guidance versus the -- or where are you right now versus your initial budget plan? I think you mentioned over-delivery in year one, so maybe more hardcore numbers if possible there. And how does the incremental $100 million to $150 million next year compare to your original timeline? Thank you. Jim Snee : Yes, I think the big thing, Rahi, is we're on track, right? I mean as we thought about what we're going to be able to deliver, we're on track. And again, it's the momentum and the acceleration that we're gaining really in this, again, we'll call it interconnected business, the flywheel -- excuse me, really being able to create that value as an organization. And obviously, the further we get along, the more capabilities that we build, the more confidence that we gain. And so we feel really good about what we did in '24, acceleration in '25, and continued acceleration in 2026. Nathan, you want to add anything? Nathan Annis : Yes, I would just say that in fiscal '24, we spent a lot of time just standing up all of the different projects. And as we go into fiscal '25, we have a running start. We've got more and bigger projects pushing the team to think bigger. So a lot of things in the pipeline and pretty excited about how it's all shaping up and feel like we're on track. Rahi Parikh : Okay. Sounds good. Thanks so much for the color. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Mr. Jim Snee for any closing remarks. Jim Snee : Well, I want to thank all of you for joining us today. As you can tell, we are incredibly proud of what we accomplished in 2024 and even more excited about the momentum that we have as we enter 2025. There is a lot of great work being done by our amazing team. I want to wish all of you a safe, healthy, and happy holiday season. Have a great rest of your week. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect it.",
